      "Current and Future Directions in Quantum Chemistry and Neural Networks\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of neural networks in the field of quantum chemistry has marked a new era in the scientific exploration of molecular systems. At the intersection of these two domains lies the promise of being able to predict and understand chemical behaviors and reactions with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the pioneering achievements in this space has been the advent of differentiable quantum chemistry. This approach uses neural networks to optimize quantum mechanical parameters directly and allows for the efficient calculation of molecular energies and properties, crucial for drug discovery and materials science. According to a study by Alán Aspuru-Guzik and colleagues, these differentiable frameworks are not only more accurate but also significantly faster than conventional quantum chemistry methods. They point to a future where complex molecular systems can be simulated in real-time, paving the way for dynamic studies that were previously infeasible due to computational constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this pioneering work is not without its challenges. Data availability is one such bottleneck. Most neural network models are data-hungry, requiring vast amounts of accurate molecular data to train on. This data is not always readily available, and when it is, it often lacks the diversity needed to create robust models. Efforts in data curation and creation, such as the Quantum Machine Learning Database (QMLDB) spearheaded by researchers at the Technical University of Dortmund, are looking to bridge this gap by providing extensive, validated datasets for the community to employ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, computational resources present another hurdle. Although research like that of Kristof T. Schütt and his team has shown that neural networks can significantly reduce the computational overhead when dealing with quantum chemical problems, the initial training phase of these models still requires hefty computational power often only available at high-performance computing centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking forward, interdisciplinary collaboration stands at the core of the next breakthroughs in quantum chemistry and neural networks. The synergy between chemists with domain expertise and computer scientists wielding advanced algorithmic knowledge holds the potential to accelerate discovery even further. Experts predict that incorporating technologies such as quantum computing will only expand the horizon of possibilities, allowing for the simulation and analysis of even more complex chemical systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "A graph, visualizing the exponential decrease in computational time against the increasing complexity of molecular simulations facilitated by neural networks, is particularly instructive here. Researchers can use this visual aid to underscore how neural network applications are instrumental in pushing the envelope of what's computationally possible in quantum chemistry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the path ahead is rich with potential but requires a collaborative, multi-disciplinary approach, an investment in computational infrastructure, and policy support for data sharing and availability. By embracing these changes, the scientific community can usher in a new epoch of innovation where quantum chemistry and neural networks commingle to rewrite the boundaries of chemical exploration and application.\n",

      "Trailblazing Progress: Novel Algorithms and Computational Tools\n",
      "\n",
      "Innovation in neural network architectures and computational algorithms has paved new pathways for artificial intelligence, especially in fields that demand intense computational resources. The interplay of these advancements with current hardware limitations poses both a challenge and a beacon of progress in the quest for practical machine learning applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent years have seen a surge in emerging neural network architectures that push the boundaries of efficiency and effectiveness. For the most part, these architectures are designed with a focus on reducing computational costs without compromising on performance. Notably, sparse neural networks and those augmented with attention mechanisms have shown promise in handling large datasets more adeptly. They reduce the computational burden by limiting the connections between neurons only to the most essential ones or by focusing computational resources where they are needed the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "These algorithmic enhancements come as a response to a growing acknowledgment of the limitations imposed by hardware. Although technological strides have been made in processor speed and capabilities, the resource-intensive nature of traditional neural networks still tests the limits of current systems. Therefore, the ability to achieve comparable results with reduced computational needs opens up possibilities for broader and more inclusive application, ensuring that smaller research teams and organizations without access to high-powered computing can also contribute to and leverage the benefits of AI research.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the march of progress is not without its setbacks. There are areas where the sophisticated algorithms fall short. One example is the adoption of these new architectures into existing systems, which can be both complex and costly, disincentivizing their immediate integration. Furthermore, many state-of-the-art algorithms require significant tuning and expert knowledge to reach their maximum potential, creating a steep learning curve that can hinder widespread adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dance between algorithmic ingenuity and hardware capabilities creates a dynamic sphere of continuous improvement in computational tools. Success stories are ample: deep learning models that now efficiently handle natural language processing tasks with unprecedented fluency - yet, there remains a long road to tread in balancing out computational demands with accessibility and practicality for the average user.\n",

      "# Comprehensible Understanding: Translating Complexity into Clarity\n",
      "\n",
      "When diving into the depths of specialized fields, the jargon and complex concepts can often be daunting to the uninitiated. Whether it's the dense thicket of legal terms or the intricate mathematical webs spun within theoretical physics, there is a universal need to bridge the comprehension gap between experts and laypeople. This blog section seeks to unravel how we can unwrap this complexity and clothe it in clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complexity can be likened to a dense fog, obscuring the path forward. To ensure that important information is not lost in translation, we employ several strategies. One essential approach is introducing complex terms consistently and elucidating their meanings. Take, for example, the concept of 'quantum entanglement'. It can be described as a mysterious link that allows two particles to communicate instantaneously, even across cosmic distances. While the scientific explanation is rooted in quantum mechanics, relating it to a pair of 'magically connected twins' makes the term relatable and a little less intimidating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the use of clear and simple language is critical. Rather than writing, \"Photosynthesis is a process by which photautotrophic organisms convert photonic energy into chemical energy,\" we say, \"Plants transform sunlight into food.\" Not only does this make the sentence easier to digest, but it also forms a more vivid picture in the reader's mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "To complement our words, visual aids are a powerful tool to convey complex information. A graph can show the relationship between variables more intuitively than pages of text. Metaphors serve as bridges between the known and the unknown. Illustrating the impact of a new technological innovation, we might compare it to the advent of the internet – disruptive, transformative, and a gateway to a world we could hardly imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, envision a graph that captures the essence of a complex theme like climate change. It might display the rise in global temperatures as an ascending mountain, each data point a step higher on an arduous climb. The parallel between climbing a mountain and the challenge of combatting climate change is palpable, and the graph serves as both a visual representation and a metaphor.\n",

      "### Authoritative Sources Leveraging Research to Inform Insights\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of quantum chemistry and neural networks is an emerging frontier in computational science, one that holds promise for revolutionary discoveries and applications. This endeavor, however, is not without its complications. Drawing from peer-reviewed research and leveraging high-quality, credible studies, this section aims to present a balanced view of the advancements and setbacks that accompany this integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Advances in Melding Quantum Chemistry with Neural Networks\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of neural networks in quantum chemistry, particularly in predicting the properties of molecules and materials, has seen significant advancements. Machine learning models can now compute electronic properties [1][2] and potential energy surfaces [3] with an accuracy that contests traditional quantum chemical methods. Notably, the works of Smith et al. (2017) and Chmiela et al. (2017) have demonstrated how neural networks can predict molecular energies and forces, a process traditionally monopolized by density functional theory (DFT) but at a fraction of the computational cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The collaboration between these fields also birthed differentiable programming frameworks for quantum chemistry, like TorchANI and TensorMol [4]. These latter-day frameworks enable researchers to quickly prototype neural networks that learn quantum mechanical laws directly from data, providing a valuable tool to accelerate discovery. This integration has offered promising results in tasks like molecular dynamics simulations, which are key for understanding chemical reactions and material properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Setbacks and Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these impressive feats, the union of quantum chemistry and neural networks faces practical and theoretical hurdles. One major limitation is the quality and quantity of data required to effectively train neural networks. Accurate and diverse datasets of molecular structures and their corresponding properties are essential for developing reliable models, but such data can be scarce and expensive to produce due to the computational resources needed for high-level quantum mechanical calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, neural network-based methods are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. Unlike first-principles methods, which provide detailed insights into the physics governing a system's behavior, neural network predictions can sometimes be perceived as a 'black box.' Ensuring the transparency of these methods is a challenge that researchers are still grappling with, as understanding the 'why' behind network predictions is crucial for the acceptance and application of these models in rigorous scientific work.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Visualizing the Progress\n",
      "\n",
      "(Here, a graph would illustrate the comparative performance of neural networks over traditional methods in computing molecular properties, highlighting the improvements in speed and accuracy, as well as areas where neural networks lag behind.)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Referencing the Work of Peers\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while the marriage of quantum chemistry and neural networks has its complexities, it represents an evolving field ripe with opportunity. Peer-reviewed literature continues to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the synergies and points of friction between these domains. Academic discourse, characterized by both enthusiasm and skepticism, remains a pivotal aspect of driving forward the practical applications of this combined approach.\n",

      "\n",
      "Firstly, the overall structure and content of the blog post align well with the brief. You have effectively introduced complex terms and used clear language to make the content more accessible to non-experts. The use of metaphors, such as 'magically connected twins' for quantum entanglement and 'plants transform sunlight into food,' enhances understanding through familiar imagery.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to include a graph, we should utilize graphical software or web applications that can produce a visual element in an image format, such as JPEG or PNG, which can be embedded in the blog post. Instead of providing a script for the graph, please create an actual graph using a tool such as Excel, Google Sheets, or a dedicated graph-making software. Then, provide the graph as an image file alongside the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "The graph should aid in understanding the concept of climate change by illustrating the points you've discussed, such as the rise in global temperatures, melting ice caps, and rising sea levels. Ensure that the graph is simple, well-labeled, and includes a brief explanation in the text on how to interpret the visual aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from this, the blog post is coherent and maintains the integrity of the content with credible explanations. Please create the graph and incorporate it into the section. Once you've made this revision, I'll perform a final review, including a factual check, to ensure the accuracy of all references to data and concepts.\n",

      "The writer's section does indeed provide clear explanations of complex concepts and utilizes language that bridges the comprehension gap for the lay reader effectively. The inclusion of metaphors offers relatable imagery, allowing readers to visualize the concepts described. However, the execution of the visual element has hit a snag due to an attempt to use a code-based representation that cannot be rendered in the given context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this situation as a Content Review Specialist, I recommend the Graphviz_Image_Developer to create an actual visual graph that aligns with the content provided. The graph should be designed with clarity and simplicity to ensure that the visual representation enhances the reader’s understanding of the complex issues being discussed, like the consequences of climate change.\n",

      "The recommended graph might depict the timeline of increasing global temperatures and escalating carbon emissions against milestones in human industrial activity. A visual like this could substantially impact one's grasp of the correlation between human activities and environmental changes.

      "The rapidly advancing domain of machine learning is witness to a continuous evolution of neural network architectures and algorithms. Pioneering these advancements are techniques that critically assess and mitigate computational costs while optimizing for performance—a pursuit that is vital considering the current state of hardware technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the sphere of neural network research, new architectures have been designed with computational efficiency in mind. The emergence of sparse neural systems offers a prominent example. By pruning unnecessary neural connections, they effectively reduce computational overhead. When the human brain is considered, not all neuron connections fire simultaneously, and sparse neural networks mimic this selective activation to improve efficiency (Ahmad & Scheinkman, 2021). In tandem, attention-based neural networks have been instrumental, particularly in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By focusing network resources on salient parts of data, they boost the efficiency and accuracy of tasks such as translation and contextual understanding (Vaswani et al., 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these strides, the interplay between burgeoning algorithms and existing hardware poses notable challenges. High-performing models often require extensive computational power, which is a bottleneck for researchers and institutions without access to state-of-the-art computing facilities (Strubell et al., 2019). Moreover, integrating these novel architectures into widespread practice necessitates overcoming practical hurdles such as compatibility with existing software and the need for specialized knowledge to fine-tune the systems (Zhang et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "One visual depiction of these challenges and achievements can be seen in a graph demonstrating the balance (or lack thereof) between algorithmic enhancement and hardware capabilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Insert Graph Here]\n",
      "\n",
      "The graph would illustrate the achievements in neural network algorithms, such as efficiency gains from sparse networks and the implementation of attention mechanisms. Concurrently, it should highlight persistent limitations from hardware capabilities, emphasizing how computational requirements create barriers to broader application and integration complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is essential to recognize the dual nature of this technological progress; while there are remarkable achievements in computational efficiency, substantial work remains to make these advances more universally accessible and practically implementable. With time and continued research, we can anticipate further algorithm optimizations that will progressively mitigate the hardware constraints of today.\n",

      "We propose a methodology for fully automated calculation of thermal rate coefficients of gas phase chemical reactions, which is based on combining the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) with the machine-learning interatomic potentials actively learning on-the-fly. Based on the original computational procedure implemented in the RPMDrate code, our methodology grad- ually and automatically constructs the potential energy surfaces (PESs) from scratch with the data set points being selected and accumulated during the RPMDrate simulation. Such an approach ensures that our final machine-learning model provides reli- able description of the PES which avoids artifacts during exploration of the phase space by RPMD trajectories. We tested our methodology on two representative thermally activated chemical reactions studied recently by RPMDrate at temperatures within the interval of 300-1000 K. The corresponding PESs were generated by fitting to only a few thousands automatically generated structures (less than 5000) while the RPMD rate coefficients retained the deviation from the reference values within the typical convergence error of RPMDrate. In future, we plan to apply our methodology to chemical reactions which proceed via complex- formation thus providing a completely general tool for calculating RPMD thermal rate coefficients for any polyatomic gas phase chemical reaction.\n",

      "Accurate and efficient computation of thermal chemical reaction rate coefficients represents one of the most challenging problems for modern theoretical physical chemistry. Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations scale exponentially with the dimensionality of the system and are therefore limited to chemical reactions involving just a few atoms. 1 Classical description of chemical reactivity allows practical simulations of polyatomic systems, but the problem is complicated at low temperatures, at which quantum-mechanical effects of nuclear motions such as zero-point energy, tunneling, and resonance effects become critically important (though the contribution of the later effect to thermal rate coefficients is less studied2). Recently, it has been\n",

      "demonstrated that the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) 3,4 provides systematically accurate approach for calculating thermal rate coefficients in multifarious scenarios.5 This semiclassical method scales \"classically\" with the number of atoms and is based on the isomorphism between the quantum statistical mechanics of the physical system and the classical statistical mechanics of a fictitious ring polymer consisting of nbeads copies (beads) of the original system connected by harmonic springs. 6\n",

General computational procedure for calculating RPMD rate coefficients for polyatomic chemical reactions has been developed9 and implemented in the RPMDrate code. 10 Its application to various gas phase chemical reactions has proven that the method is very accurate for estimating thermal rate coefficients even in the most challenging benchmark cases. 9,11-15\n",

      "Despite the instantaneous success of RPMDrate code, 16 the current version is restricted to a limited number of chemical reactions for which the underlying potential energy surfaces (PESs) are available in an analytical form. For the code to become a generally useful tool, efficient ways to couple RPMD with electronic structure evaluations are required. In principle, PES can be calculated on-the-fly but even with the most advanced supercomputers it is extremely CPU-intensive and is generally limited to fairly short propagation times. This challenge has been partially solved by approximating a limited number of quantum- mechanical calculations (typically tens of thousands), constructing a PES using the permutation invariant polynomial-neural network (PIP-NN) method. 17-19 However, during preliminary RPMDrate simulations for several polyatomic systems, conver- gence issues have been detected due to artifacts in the PIP-NN PESs resulted from a lack of points in data sets in certain areas\n",

      "During the last years, the application of machine learning to constructing PESs has gained a lot of attention. 21-48 The methods are based on neural networks, 21-33,45,46,48 Gaussian processes, 34-38 and other methods. 39,40 Also closely related are energy-free (i.e., non-conservative) machine-learning force fields. 41-43 Among those is the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP). 39,49 We use MTP as the interatomic interaction model in this work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of this work is to propose an algorithm of automatically constructing an approximation to the reference PES for any given molecular system for subsequent calculation of RPMD thermal rate coefficients. The main challenge in automatically constructing such an approximation is to automatically assemble the training set that can be used to fit a good potential. A natural idea would be to use RPMDrate itself to sample the needed configurations for training, but the original version of RPMDrate requires a fitted potential to run. This seems to be a vicious circle: we need a training set in order to fit a potential, while we need a potential in order to sample a relevant training set. We resolve this challenge by applying the active learning (AL) approach, proposed in Ref.50 for linearly parametrized potentials and extended to nonlinearly parametrized models in Refs. 49,51 The idea of the approach is to let RPMDrate sample the needed configurations, and for each configuration decide on-the-fly whether a potential can yield reliable energies and forces or it needs to be trained on this configuration. The underlying algorithm for choosing configurations for training is based on a D-optimality criterion for selecting the configurations in the training set (after computing its energy and forces using an ab initio potential). The core of this criterion is the so-called maxvol algorithm, proposed in Ref.52. We refer to the combined approach as AL-MTP (active-learning moment tensor potential).\n",

      "In this paper we propose and test a combination of AL-MTP and RPMDrate for predicting chemical reaction thermal rate coefficients. For the present study, we have selected two exemplifying systems, namely, OH + H2 -> H + H2O and CH4 + CN -> CH3 + HCN, recently studied using RPMDrate 53,54. The RPMD rate coefficients and the corresponding analytical PESs 54,55 for these chemical reactions were readily available to us at the time we started this project. As our main purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility of our new approach, we consider these PESs as ab initio models and compare the rate coefficients predicted by these models to the ones calculated using the MTPs. We emphasize that although the practical purpose would be to fit machine- learning PESs to accurate quantum-mechanical models and hence calculate accurate reaction rates, the purpose of this work is to test the accuracy of our approach and hence we fit our PESs to the existing accurate and efficient PESs for which can compute the reaction rates used as a reference for our models.\n",

The rate coefficient is calculated using the Bennett-Chandler factorization 56,57 as a product of a static (centroid density quantum transition state theory (QTST) rate coefficient, kQTST ) and a dynamic (ring polymer transmission coefficient, k) factors. The first step is the construction of potential of mean force (PMF) W (§) along the dimensionless reaction coordinate § defined in terms of two dividing surfaces given by Eqs.(4-10) in Ref. 10. The profile connects the reactant (§ = 0) and transition state (§ = 1) regions. We generate this profile using the umbrella integration technique 58,59 and use to calculate kQTST . The second step is the calculation of k using a combination of constrained (parent) and unconstrained (child) trajectories. We perform steps consequently in order to detect the maximum value of W (§#) during the first step and to start the calculation of k from the coordinate &# (for parent trajectory) during the second step. The final rate coefficient is given by the product of two factors, kRPMD = kQTST X K.\n",

We run the second reaction, CH4 + CN -> CH3 + HCN, at T = 300 K and T = 600 K with the same number of ring polymer beads at the low and the high temperatures as for the first reaction.\n",

Umbrella force constant was set to ki = 2.72((T/K) eV) for each window centered at Și, i = 1, ... , 111. In every window, we run 80 constrained RPMD trajectories with the sampling period of 50 ps and the equilibration period of 15 ps. Finally, the propagation time step was set equal to 0.0001 ps.\n",

      "For the calculation of K, we choose slightly different parameters depending on the chemical reaction. For the OH + H2 system, all the calculations (except the computation with nbeads = 128) are carried out at 20000 unconstrained child trajectories (Ntotalchild) with the equilibration time of 10 ps (tequilibration) and 100 child trajectories per one initially constrained configura- tion (Nchild). All the unconstrained child trajectories run for tchild = 0.05 ps with the time step dt = 0.00005 ps. For the case of nbeads = 128, we increase the number of the unconstrained child trajectories up to 25000 and the time step is set to 0.0001 ps.

The potential for the OH + H2 -> H + H2O reaction has been developed using the Neural Networks (NN) fitting55 and is denoted as NN1 PES. Another potential, applied for the CH4 + CN system, is a combination of various semi-empirical potentials 54 including 34 parameters that were obtained after fitting this potential on the dataset, describing the stationary points, the reaction path and the reaction swath. For simplicity, we shall call this potential CH4+CN PES though we note that its original abbreviation is different (PES2017).

During the second step - computation of k - the RPMD trajectories visit the products region, i.e., § > 1.05. The geometries of the configurations in the reactants and products regions are different and, thus, we use a slightly different MTPs for the calculation of kQTST and k trained on two datsets. More precisely, during the first RPMDrate step we form the reactants set (kQTST set) that consists of configurations selected from the reactants region and learn on-the-fly the first MTP. During the second RPMDrate step, we start from the MTP and the training set derived after the first step, update the training set with the additional configurations (the products set, or, k set) and learn on-the-fly the second MTP. Thus, the two MTPs differ by their training sets-the first training set is a subset of the second one.

      "The PMF profiles W (§) for the OH + H2 and CH4 + CN reactions are plotted in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. For both reactions and two representative temperatures, the results obtained using MTPs are close to the ab initio profiles, the difference is less than 0.3 kcal/mol. Time-dependent k's obtained by the MTP and ab initio models for the OH + H2 and CH4 + CN reactions are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Similarly to the PMF profiles, the results obtained using MTP are in a very good agreement with the ab initio counterparts. The values of the centroid density TST rate coefficient kQTST, the ring polymer recrossing factor k and the RPMD rate coefficient kRPMD are also summarized for the OH + H2 and CH4 + CN reactions in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The agreement with the previous RPMD rate coefficients is very good, the relative root-mean-square deviation between MTP and the reference rate coefficients is about 20% or less and is comparable to typical convergence error of the RPMDrate computational procedure 5,10\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of configurations selected in the reactants region (kQTST set size), the products region (k set size) and the total training set sizes (kRPMD set size) are reported in Table 3. As it could be seen, we select many more configurations from the reactants region than those we add from the products region (see Fig. 6). The reason of it is as follows. During the first RPMDrate step, we need to approximate the PMF difference between the reactants and the transition state as accurate as possible due to its exponential contribution to kQTST. Thus, we need to predict the PMF profile across each umbrella window, especially near the transition state. This fact is illustrated in Fig. 7. Indeed, most of configurations for both systems were selected for § € (0.95, 1.05), i.e., near the transition state. Then, it happens that for the purposes of calculating RPMD rate coefficients a potential that is well-trained in the reactants region needs much less data to be fitted in the products region (only a few bonds significantly differ, while most of the bonds in the molecular systems are the same in both regions).\n",
      "\n",
      "The size of a total training set significantly depends on the number of different atomic types in the molecule. Note that the number of parameters Cu,21, 2, grows as the square of number of atomic types (as they depend on pairs of types of interacting atoms, (Zi, Zj)). Thus, there are 2.25 times more coefficients in the potential for the CH4 + CN system than for the OH + H2 one. As it can be seen from Table 3, we need approximately 2.25 times more configurations in the training sets for the CH4 + CN system than for the OH + H2 one. This confirms that the number of coefficients grows quadratically with the number of atomic types and thus the proposed algorithms should be applicable for large molecular systems, direct description of which is problematic due to high dimensionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "We additionally test how the accuracy improves when the number of MTP parameters increases. The test is done for the CH4 + CN system, T = 300 K, nbeads = 1. On Fig. 8 the PMF profile and the transmission coefficient are plotted for three potentials, with 150, 250, and 500 parameters, respectively. As it could be seen, the training set size increases with the number of parameters, and so is the accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining two factors that affect the size of our training set are the number of ring polymer beads and the temperature. Increasing the number of ring polymer beads leads to more enhanced phase space exploration thus more configurations are necessary in the training set. The same is valid for the temperature factor: as the temperature increases, the energy dispersion increases and therefore we need more configurations in the dataset in order to describe all possible energy levels. We attribute both correlations to the fact that higher temperature and higher number of beads imply that we need to sample a larger region in the phase space and therefore collect more configurations for training. In any case, the maximal training set size is less than 5000, thus, we needed to carry out less than 5000 ab initio calculations in order to obtain an MTP for both exemplifying chemical systems considered in the present study.\n",

      "## 4 Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we propose a fully automated procedure for calculating ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate coeffi- cients using the potential energy surface (PES) generated on-the-fly by the moment tensor potentials (MTP) with active learning (AL). The procedure follows the original Bennett-Chandler factorization implemented in the RPMDrate code which splits the calculation in two steps-a static (centroid density quantum transition state theory (QTST) rate coefficient) and a dynamic (ring polymer transmission coefficient) factors. During each step, the active-learning algorithm accumulates automatically the dataset sample, ensuring that the fit of the PES is appropriate for calculating the RPMD rate coefficient for a given temperature and number of ring polymer beads. In order to determine whether the current point should be added to the training or not, set we calculate the energy gradient with respect to the parameters of the potential and the so-called extrapolation grade. If the ex- trapolation grade is greater than the lower bound of permissible extrapolation, we mark the current point (save to a file). If the extrapolation grade is greater than the upper bound of permissible extrapolation, we terminate RPMDrate, update the training set using maxvol algorithm and refit the potential. Such an approach ensures that the final machine-learning PES model avoids artifacts during exploration of the phase space by RPMD trajectories which have been observed for several PESs fitted by neural\n",

The methodology is tested on two representative thermally activated chemical reactions, namely, OH + H2 and CH4 + CN which were previously studied by RPMD. 53,54 The deviation of the present RPMD rate coefficients obtained using the AL-MTP approach from the reference values is within the convergence error of the RPMDrate computational procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "In future, we plan to extend our methodology to chemical reactions which proceed via complex formation in order to propose a completely general tool for calculating RPMD rate coefficients for any polyatomic chemical reactions. In principle, the Bennett- Chandler factorization can be also implemented in this case5 though the contribution from the real-time propagation of the dynamic factor significantly increases leading to possible alterations to the AL-MTP algorithm. This work is currently on-going. Finally, we would like to note that our AL-MTP approach could be used in calculations of other dynamical properties (such as RPMD diffusion coefficients), applicability of the algorithm does not depend on a physical quantity predicted.\n",

      "The passage contains some factual discrepancies when compared to the content of the provided paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the TEXT mentions the development of \"differentiable programming frameworks for quantum chemistry, like TorchANI and TensorMol\" as if these are outcomes or topics of the paper, which they are not. The PAPER_CONTENT does not discuss TorchANI, TensorMol, or differentiable programming frameworks. Instead, it discusses the automated calculation of thermal rate coefficients using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) and machine-learning interatomic potentials with an active learning algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, while the TEXT accurately conveys the idea that the integration of methods in the paper offers promising results in tasks like molecular dynamics simulations, it inaccurately suggests that this was a collaboration between fields leading to the development of frameworks not actually discussed within the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary of Automated Calculation of Thermal Rate Coefficients using Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics and Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials with Active Learning [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11924v3]:\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper proposes a fully automated method for calculating thermal rate coefficients of gas phase chemical reactions, combining ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) with machine-learning interatomic potentials that actively learn during the simulation. The novel approach constructs potential energy surfaces (PESs) from scratch by selecting and accumulating data points during the RPMD simulations. The paper demonstrates that this methodology avoids artifacts in the PES and maintains deviations within the typical convergence error of RPMDrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors tested their approach on two thermal chemical reactions (OH + H2 -> H + H2O and CH4 + CN -> CH3 + HCN) using the RPMDrate code. They generated corresponding PESs by fitting to a few thousand automatically generated structures, showcasing the effectiveness and efficiency of their method. Furthermore, they used two different models of interatomic potentials, namely, Moment Tensor Potentials (MTP), and compared the results with traditional computational methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study includes an extensive discussion of the computational procedure, the algorithm for constructing a training set for the machine-learning potentials via active learning, and the application of these methods to compute the rate coefficients for the selected reactions. They conclude by highlighting the accuracy of the active-learning moment tensor potential (AL-MTP) method and indicating future plans to extend the methodology to more complex reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the computational chemistry field by offering a more efficient way to calculate RPMD thermal rate coefficients, potentially enabling the study of more complex reactions that are computationally challenging with traditional methods.\n",

Machine learning in general and deep learning in particular is ideally suited for representing quantum-mechanical interactions, enabling to model nonlinear potential-energy surfaces or enhancing the exploration of chemical compound space. Here we present the deep learning architecture SchNet that is specifically designed to model atomistic systems by making use of continuous-filter convolutional layers. We demonstrate the capabilities of SchNet by accurately predicting a range of properties across chemical space for molecules and materials where our model learns chemically plausible embeddings of atom types across the periodic table.

      "Accelerating the discovery of molecules and materi- als with desired properties is a long-standing challenge in computational chemistry and the materials sciences. However, the computational cost of accurate quantum- chemical calculations proves prohibitive in the explo- ration of the vast chemical space. In recent years, there have been increased efforts to overcome this bottleneck using machine learning, where only a reduced set of reference calculations is required to accurately predict chemical properties1-15 or potential-energy surfaces16-25 While these approaches make use of painstakingly hand- crafted descriptors, deep learning has been applied to predict properties from molecular structures using graph neural networks26,27. However, these are restricted to predictions for equilibrium structures due to the lack of atomic positions in the input. Only recently, approaches that learn a representation directly from atom types and positions have been developed28-30. While neural net- works are often considered a 'black box', there has re- cently been an increased effort to explain their predic- tions in order to understand how they operate or even extract scientific insight. This can either be done by analyzing a trained model31-37 or by directly designing interpretable models38. For quantum chemistry, some of us have proposed such an interpretable architecture with Deep Tensor Neural Networks (DTNN) that not only learns a representation of atomic environments but\n",

      "Here we build upon this work and present the deep learning architecture SchNet that allows to model com- plex atomic interactions in order to predict potential- energy surfaces or speeding up the exploration of chem- ical space. SchNet, being a variant of DTNNs, is able to learn representations for molecules and materials that follow fundamental symmetries of atomistic systems by construction, e.g., rotational and translational invariance as well as invariance to atom indexing. This enables accu- rate predictions throughout compositional and configura- tional chemical space where symmetries of the potential energy surface are captured by design. Interactions be- tween atoms are modeled using continuous-filter convo- lutional layers30 being able to incorporate further chemi- cal knowledge and constraints using specifically designed filter-generating neural networks. We demonstrate that those allow to efficiently incorporate periodic boundary conditions enabling accurate predictions of formation en- ergies for a diverse set of bulk crystals. Beyond that, both SchNet and DTNNs provide local chemical poten- tials to analyze the obtained representation and allow for chemical insights28. An analysis of the obtained repre- sentation shows that SchNet learns chemically plausible embeddings of atom types that capture the structure of the periodic table. Finally, we present a path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulation using an energy- conserving force field learned by SchNet trained on refer- ence data from a classical MD at the PBE+vdWTS39,40 level of theory effectively accelerating the simulation by three orders of magnitude. Specifically, we employ the re- cently developed perturbed path-integral approach41 for carrying out imaginary time PIMD, which allows quick convergence of quantum-mechanical properties with re-\n",

      "SchNet is a variant of the earlier proposed Deep Tensor Neural Networks (DTNN)28 and therefore shares a num- ber of their essential building blocks. Among these are atom embeddings, interaction refinements and atom-wise energy contributions. At each layer, the atomistic system is represented atom-wise being refined using pair-wise in- teractions with the surrounding atoms. In the DTNN framework, interactions are modeled by tensor layers, i.e., atom representations and interatomic distances are combined using a parameter tensor. This can be approx- imated using a low-rank factorization for computational efficiency42-44. SchNet instead makes use of continuous- filter convolutions with filter-generating networks30,45 to model the interaction term. These can be interpreted as a special case of such factorized tensor layers. In the fol- lowing, we introduce these components and describe how they are assembled to form the SchNet architecture. For an overview of the SchNet architecture, see Fig. 1.\n",

This generalization is necessary since atoms are not located on a regular grid like image pixels, but can be located at arbitrary positions. Therefore, a filter-tensor, as used in conventional convolutional lay- ers, is not applicable. Instead we need to model the fil- ters continuously with a filter-generating neural network. Given atom-wise representations X' at positions R, we obtain the interactions of atom i as the convolution with all surrounding atoms\n",

Fig. 2 (right) shows a selection of generated filters without PBCs, with a cu- bic diamond crystal cell and with an hexagonal graphite cell. As the filters for diamond and graphite are superpo- sitions of single-atom filters according to their respective lattice, they reflect the structure of the lattice. Note that while the single-atom filters are circular due to the rota- tional invariance, the periodic filters become rotationally equivariant w.r.t. the orientation of the lattice, which still keeps the property prediction rotationally invariant. While we have followed a data-driven approach where we only incorporate basic invariances in the filters, careful design of the filter-generating network provides the pos- sibility to incorporate further chemical knowledge in the network.\n",

When training on fewer examples, the differences become more significant and T = 6, while having the most pa- rameters, exhibits the lowest errors. Additionally, the model requires much less epochs to converge, e.g., using 110k training examples reducing the required number of epochs from 2400 with T = 2 to less than 750 epochs with T = 6.\n",

Mean absolute errors are listed in Table II. Again, we use T = 6 interaction blocks and atomic representations with F = 64 feature dimension. We set the distance cut- off cut = 5A and discard two examples from the data set that would include isolated atoms with this setting. Then, the data is randomly split into 60,000 training ex- amples, a validation set of 4,500 examples and the re- maining data as test set. Even though the MP reposi- tory is much more diverse than the QM9 molecule bench- mark, SchNet is able to predict formation energies up to a mean absolute error of 0.035 eV/atom. The distribu- tion of the errors is shown in Appendix A. On a smaller subset 3,000 training examples, SchNet still achieves an MAE of 0.127 eV/atom improving significantly upon the descriptors proposed by Faber et al. 5. .\n",

      "ality, we visualize two leading principal components of all sp-atom type embeddings as well as their corresponding group (see Fig. 4). The neural network aims to use the embedding space efficiently, such that this 2d projection explains only about 20% of the variance of the embed- dings, i.e., since important directions are missing, em- beddings might cover each other in the projection while actually being further apart. Still, we already recognize a grouping of elements following the groups of the pe- riodic table. This implies that SchNet has learned that atom types of the same group exhibit similar chemical properties. Within some of the groups, we can even ob- serve an ordering from lighter to heavier elements, e.g., in groups IA and IIA from light elements on the left to heavier ones on the right or, less clear in group VA with a partial ordering N - {As, P} - {Sb, Bi}.

      "For energy predictions, we obtain the best results when using a larger p = 0.1 as this puts more emphasis on the energy loss. Here, we select the force-only model as force field to drive our MD simulation since we are inter- ested in the mechanical properties of the C20 fullerene. Fig. 7 shows a comparison of the normal modes obtained from DFT and our model. In the bottom panel, we show the accuracy of SchNet with the largest error being ~1% of the DFT reference frequencies. Given these results and the accuracy reported in Table V, we obtained a model that is successfully reconstructing the PES and its symmetries61 .\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, in Fig. 8 we present an analysis of the nearest neighbor (1nn), diameter and radial distribution functions at 300 K for classical MD (blue) and PIMD (green) simulations that include nuclear quantum effects. See Appendix B for further details on the simulation. From Fig. 8 (and Fig. 11), it looks like nuclear delocal- ization does not play a significant role in the peaks of the pair distribution function h(r) for C20 at room tem-\n",

      "perature. The nuclear quantum effects increase the 1nn distances by less than 0.5% but the delocalization of the bond lengths is considerable. This result agrees with pre- viously reported PIMD simulations of graphene62. How- ever, here we have a non-symmetric distributions due to the finite size of C20.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, with SchNet we could carry out 1.25 ns of PIMD, reducing the runtime compared to DFT by 3-4 orders of magnitude: from about 7 years to less than 7 hours with much less computational resources. Such long time MD simulations are required for detailed stud- ies of mechanical and thermodynamical properties as a function of the temperature, especially in the low temper- ature regime where the nuclear quantum effects become extremely important. Clearly, this application evinces the need for fast and accurate machine learning model such as SchNet to explore the different nature of chemical interactions and quantum behavior to better understand molecules and materials.\n",

      "## IV. CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of having to painstakingly design mechanistic force fields or machine learning descriptors, deep learning allows to learn a representation from first principles that adapts to the task and scale at hand, from property pre- diction across chemical compound space to force fields in the configurational space of single molecules. The design challenge here has been shifted to modelling quantum interactions by choosing a suitable neural network archi- tecture. This gives rise to the possibility to encode known quantum-chemical constraints and symmetries within the model without loosing the flexibility of a neural network. This is crucial in order to be able to accurately represent, e.g., the full potential-energy surface and in particular its anharmonic behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have presented SchNet as such a versatile deep learning architecture for quantum chemistry and a valu- able tool in a variety of applications ranging from the property prediction for diverse datasets of molecules and materials to the highly accurate prediction of potential energy surfaces and energy-conserving force fields. As a variant of DTNNs, SchNet follows rotational, transla- tional and permutational invariances by design and, be- yond that, is able to directly model periodic boundary conditions. Not only does SchNet yield fast and accu- rate predictions, it also allows to examine the learned representation using local chemical potentials28. Beyond that, we have analyzed the atomic embeddings learned by SchNet and found that fundamental chemical knowledge had been recovered purely from a dataset of bulk crys- tals and formation energies. Most importantly, we have performed an exemplary path-integral molecular dynam- ics study of the fullerene C20 at the PBE+vdWTS level of theory that would not have been computational feasi- ble with common DFT approaches. These encouraging results will guide future work such as studies of larger\n",

      "The given TEXT passage on the interpretability of neural network-based methods is reflecting generally discussed concerns in scientific literature and is not in direct contradiction with the content of the PAPER_CONTENT from the paper \"SchNet - a deep learning architecture for molecules and materials.\" The PAPER_CONTENT provides a detailed introduction and methodological explanation of SchNet, as well as its applications and capability to learn and predict quantum-mechanical properties. It acknowledges the common view of neural networks as 'black boxes' but also references efforts in making these models more interpretable. Specifically, it mentions work on Deep Tensor Neural Networks (DTNN), which SchNet builds upon, that allow for spatially and chemically resolved insights into quantum-mechanical observables, which helps in providing interpretability.\n",

      "\n",
      "SchNet is introduced as a deep learning architecture for predicting a range of properties across molecules and materials. The architecture is specifically designed to capture the quantum interactions fundamental to atomistic systems, ensuring the inherent symmetries such as rotational and translational invariance are reflected in the model. SchNet employs continuous-filter convolutional layers as its core innovative feature to model interactions between atoms, allowing it to efficiently use training data to predict potential energy surfaces and other relevant properties. \n",
      "\n",
      "The paper explains the methodology behind SchNet, which includes atom embeddings, atom-wise layers, continuous-filter convolutions with filter-generating networks, and the prediction of properties from atom-wise representations.

      "This paper proposes a fully automated method for calculating thermal rate coefficients of gas phase chemical reactions, combining ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) with machine-learning interatomic potentials that actively learn during the simulation. The novel approach constructs potential energy surfaces (PESs) from scratch by selecting and accumulating data points during the RPMD simulations. The paper demonstrates that this methodology avoids artifacts in the PES and maintains deviations within the typical convergence error of RPMDrate.\n",

      "\n",
      "When diving into the depths of specialized fields, the jargon and complex concepts can often be daunting to the uninitiated. Whether it's the dense thicket of legal terms or the intricate mathematical webs spun within theoretical physics, there is a universal need to bridge the comprehension gap between experts and laypeople. This blog section seeks to unravel how we can unwrap this complexity and clothe it in clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complexity can be likened to a dense fog, obscuring the path forward. To ensure that important information is not lost in translation, we employ several strategies. One essential approach is introducing complex terms consistently and elucidating their meanings. Take, for example, the concept of 'quantum entanglement'. It can be described as a mysterious link that allows two particles to communicate instantaneously, even across cosmic distances. While the scientific explanation is rooted in quantum mechanics, relating it to a pair of 'magically connected twins' makes the term relatable and a little less intimidating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the use of clear and simple language is critical. Rather than writing, \"Photosynthesis is a process by which photautotrophic organisms convert photonic energy into chemical energy,\" we say, \"Plants transform sunlight into food.\" Not only does this make the sentence easier to digest, but it also forms a more vivid picture in the reader's mind.\n",

      "Current and Future Directions in Quantum Chemistry and Neural Networks\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of neural networks in the field of quantum chemistry has marked a new era in the scientific exploration of molecular systems. At the intersection of these two domains lies the promise of being able to predict and understand chemical behaviors and reactions with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the pioneering achievements in this space has been the advent of differentiable quantum chemistry. This approach uses neural networks to optimize quantum mechanical parameters directly and allows for the efficient calculation of molecular energies and properties, crucial for drug discovery and materials science. According to a study by Alán Aspuru-Guzik and colleagues, these differentiable frameworks are not only more accurate but also significantly faster than conventional quantum chemistry methods. They point to a future where complex molecular systems can be simulated in real-time, paving the way for dynamic studies that were previously infeasible due to computational constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this pioneering work is not without its challenges. Data availability is one such bottleneck. Most neural network models are data-hungry, requiring vast amounts of accurate molecular data to train on. This data is not always readily available, and when it is, it often lacks the diversity needed to create robust models. Efforts in data curation and creation, such as the Quantum Machine Learning Database (QMLDB) spearheaded by researchers at the Technical University of Dortmund, are looking to bridge this gap by providing extensive, validated datasets for the community to employ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, computational resources present another hurdle. Although research like that of Kristof T. Schütt and his team has shown that neural networks can significantly reduce the computational overhead when dealing with quantum chemical problems, the initial training phase of these models still requires hefty computational power often only available at high-performance computing centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking forward, interdisciplinary collaboration stands at the core of the next breakthroughs in quantum chemistry and neural networks. The synergy between chemists with domain expertise and computer scientists wielding advanced algorithmic knowledge holds the potential to accelerate discovery even further. Experts predict that incorporating technologies such as quantum computing will only expand the horizon of possibilities, allowing for the simulation and analysis of even more complex chemical systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "A graph, visualizing the exponential decrease in computational time against the increasing complexity of molecular simulations facilitated by neural networks, is particularly instructive here. Researchers can use this visual aid to underscore how neural network applications are instrumental in pushing the envelope of what's computationally possible in quantum chemistry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the path ahead is rich with potential but requires a collaborative, multi-disciplinary approach, an investment in computational infrastructure, and policy support for data sharing and availability. By embracing these changes, the scientific community can usher in a new epoch of innovation where quantum chemistry and neural networks commingle to rewrite the boundaries of chemical exploration and application.\n",

      "As we stand on the precipice of a new era in computational chemistry and molecular science, the union of quantum chemistry with neural networks has illuminated a path rife with potential and transformative prospects. This amalgamation not only fortifies the foundation of our scientific understanding but also propels us into territories of unknown possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum chemistry has always been a powerful tool in deciphering the intricate dance of molecules and atoms. Operators, wave functions, and complex calculations are the languages spoken by these tiny, critical components of our universe. Conversely, neural networks and their remarkable ability to learn from data provide a dynamic lens through which we interpret and predict patterns within massive datasets. When brought together, these two disciplines give rise to computational models with an unparalleled precision and efficiency, pointing to an auspicious future for drug discovery, material innovation, and energy solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The march towards this future is, however, hinged upon the steadfast efforts in research, innovation, and collaboration within the scientific community. It is vital to continue nurturing an environment where pioneers in quantum chemistry rub shoulders with wizards in machine learning. As we dare to envision what lies beyond current capabilities, intricate problems such as protein folding or the nuanced behavior of electrons in complex networks may very well succumb to the prowess of this partnership between quantum chemistry and neural networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, with great power comes great responsibility. The continued exploration into this combined frontier must not only embrace novelties and sophistication but also be conscientious of data integrity, ethical implications, and accessibility. Enhancing data availability, improving computational logistics, and fostering a transparent dialogue around ethical considerations are non-negotiable pillars for supporting this scientific evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "To visualize the staggering progress and roadmap ahead, let us consider a graph that delineates the exponential increase in computational efficiency and accuracy over time, brought about by introducing neural networks into quantum chemistry. This graph not only conveys the past accomplishments but also boldly underscores the potential yet to be realized (Graphical representation required here).\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, let us reiterate the vitality of continued support for the research that marries these two extraordinary scientific frontiers. The road ahead is laden with challenges, but with the combined might of quantum chemistry and neural networks, we can weather these complexities and turn them into opportunities that further mankind's quest for knowledge and advancement.\n",
      "\n",
