      "IFRS stands for International Financial Reporting Standards. These are a set of accounting standards developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which is an independent, not-for-profit organization. IFRS provides a global framework for how public companies prepare and disclose their financial statements, giving investors and other users of financial information the ability to compare the financial performance of publicly listed companies on a like-for-like basis with their international peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "IFRS standards are designed to be applied by companies on a consistent basis throughout the world, which helps to ensure transparency, accountability, and efficiency in financial markets globally. This is particularly important for companies that operate in multiple countries or that have investors from different countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The standards cover a wide range of accounting activities, including revenue recognition, financial statement presentation, liabilities, assets, and the reporting of transactions between companies. Many countries require IFRS for all domestic listed companies, although some countries, like the United States, have their own accounting standards (U.S. GAAP - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and have not adopted IFRS for domestic issuers.\n",
