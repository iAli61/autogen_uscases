      "\n",
      "The pursuit of Artificial Intelligence (AI) entails not just the creation of machines that can learn and adapt, but also the assurance that they do so in ways that are safe and reliable. In this context, an \"advancement\" stands as an improvement or innovation over previous perceptions of what AI safety and reliability encompassed, distinguished by measurable enhancements in technology or methodology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing historical benchmarks to the current state of AI development exhibits a clear trajectory of sophistication and sensitivity towards these concerns. In its embryonic stage, AI safety was a nascent concept primarily addressed by preventing system malfunction or failure. Reliability pertained to consistent performance within narrow, defined tasks. Today, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen as AI frontiers, the benchmark for advancements in this realm is not merely about avoiding failure but is often characterized by the ability of these systems to responsibly interact within the dynamic tapestry of human needs and societal norms.\n",
      "\n",
      "A significant contribution to the field of AI, as evidenced by recent innovations, is the development of robust safety mechanisms that are adaptive, data-driven, and ethically grounded. For instance, the AEGIS system offers a framework that enhances the reliability of content generated by AI through complex moderation methodologies, which are vital in preempting misuse and promoting ethical content creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, breakthroughs such as Ali Baheri's data-driven approach have redefined the safety and reliability landscape by introducing a systematic process that refines policies in reinforcement learning environments. This is aimed at enhancing optimal performance in safety-critical applications, contributing to the ongoing sophistication of AI systems (Baheri, 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "These advancements also integrate ethics and governance more deeply into technical design. Dual Governance showcases another leap forward, amalgamating strict regulatory frameworks with the malleability of community-driven approaches. This method seeks to navigate ethical deployment by balancing innovation with governance considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such methodologies have been the crucible for continuous progress. The challenges once faced in AI safety and reliability have given way to inventive strategies that extend far beyond their initial scope. They demonstrate an evolution from fixed rules to dynamic systems that can understand and adapt within the contours of their environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, the research on 'Prompting4Debugging' by Chin et al. exemplifies the AI community's determination to improve safety filters, identifying vulnerabilities and devising solutions, thus advancing the reliability of AI content generators (Chin, Jiang, Huang, Chen, Chiu, 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bringing together the insights from advanced monitoring tools, iterative refinement strategies, and ethics-driven frameworks, the AI safety landscape is now populated by methodologies that guard against adverse outcomes while nurturing the immense potential of these technologies.\n",

      "The practice of engaging Red Teams for continuous monitoring is an increasingly crucial strategy for organizations to enhance their cybersecurity posture. This tactic involves employing a team whose purpose is to mimic the strategies and actions of potential attackers, attempting to breach security defenses to discover vulnerabilities before they can be exploited maliciously. The Red Team approach offers an adversarial perspective, adding depth to the security assessment process and enabling organizations to be proactive rather than reactive in their defense strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "These Red Teams employ a wide array of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are used in real-world attacks, often customizing them to target specific aspects of the organization’s infrastructure that are most vulnerable or most critical. This hands-on, simulated attack practice can lead to the identification of weaknesses that might not be evident in traditional security assessments or penetration tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "A notable case that illustrates the success of Red Teams in operational security is that of a major financial institution, which after employing a Red Team, discovered a critical flaw in their transaction processing system that could have led to multi-million dollar losses. This real-world example underscores the capability of Red Teams to provide actionable insights that can prevent serious breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuous monitoring, enabled by Red Teams, provides an ongoing assessment of security measures rather than a one-time check. This is an imperative in an ever-evolving threat landscape where attackers continuously develop new capabilities and strategies. The continuous feedback loop provided by Red Teams helps organizations to adapt their defenses in real-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stakeholders in Red Team operations span across various levels of the organization. From the security personnel who design and implement defenses, to the C-suite executives whose strategic decisions hinge on security assessments, everyone plays a role. Additionally, information technology teams, compliance officers, and sometimes even external regulatory bodies are involved in this comprehensive process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, an example of comprehensive stakeholder involvement is visible in the case of a national defense agency, where the Red Team's findings influenced decisions on defense strategies, asset allocation, and even international policy considerations. This wide-reaching impact demonstrates how Red Team operations extend beyond mere technical assessments and into the strategic fabric of organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, engaging Red Teams for continuous monitoring serves as a cornerstone for insightful security assessments and a dynamic, responsive security posture. As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, the importance of such proactive and inclusive strategies cannot be overstated, for they serve the broad spectrum of stakeholders looking to safeguard critical infrastructures and sensitive data.\n",

It entails the evaluation of an agent’s present policy, the identiﬁcation of unsafe or suboptimal actions, and the subsequent update of the policy to mitigate these deﬁciencies.

It starts with an initial candidate policy or program, which is then reﬁned based on counterexamples encountered during the veriﬁca- tion phase.

      "TXT: Advancing Transparency in AI with Interpretability Measures\n",
      "\n",
      "The transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across various sectors underscores the need for systems that are not only powerful and efficient but also transparent and understandable to all categories of users. As AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), become more pervasive, the philosophy of \"black box\" models—where decisions are made without clear, understandable rationale—is no longer viable. The push towards interpretability and explainability in AI is thus critical for wide-scale trust and adoption of these technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interpretability refers to the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision by an AI system. Similarly, explainability involves the AI system's ability to explain its behaviors in human-comprehensible terms. Together, these concepts make up the cornerstone of model transparency. Implementing these measures ensures that end-users and stakeholders can comprehend, trust, and effectively manage AI outputs, which is essential given the potential for AI decisions to profoundly affect human lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, interpretation techniques in AI have found numerous applications. For instance, financial institutions use these methodologies to dissect automated loan approval or fraud detection systems to understand the rationale behind specific decisions. In healthcare, doctors may rely on diagnostic predictions from AI but require understandable explanations to justify medical treatments or diagnoses—especially when such predictions go against conventional wisdom or practitioner experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "One approach to enhancing interpretability in healthcare is through the use of knowledge graphs to empower AI systems like LLMs, as discussed in 'Building Trustworthy NeuroSymbolic AI Systems: Consistency, Reliability, Explainability, and Safety.' These systems utilize clinically validated knowledge to present decision-making processes that mirror a clinician's logic, thereby improving the trust and efficiency of AI applications in medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another sector, the automotive industry's autonomous driving (AD) technologies deeply embed explainability as a safeguard to ensure safety. The 'Explainable AI for Safe and Trustworthy Autonomous Driving: A Systematic Review' by Kuznietsov et al. emphasizes interpretable designs, surrogate models, monitoring protocols, auxiliary explanations, and validation procedures as pillars of trustworthy AI systems in AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of explainability are not solely limited to safety-critical domains; they extend to making everyday AI interactions more intuitive. For instance, when an e-commerce recommendation system provides suggestions based on a user's purchase history or shopping behavior, explainability allows users to understand and trust the suggestions made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its significance, the path to fully interpretable AI is not without challenges. One of the primary obstacles is the balance between performance and transparency. Often, the most accurate AI models are the least interpretable, creating a trade-off situation. Moreover, the complexity of AI algorithms can make explainability an arduous feat, necessitating ongoing research and innovation to simplify explanations without compromising AI efficacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, interpretability and explainability methods in AI are rapidly evolving to meet the demand for transparency. By ensuring AI decisions can be understood and justified, we foster trust and enable responsible AI deployment across all spheres of human activity. Continuous research and investment in this area will be paramount to overcome challenges and harness AI's full potential responsibly.\n",

      "\n",
      "As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) surge ahead, shaping the contours of artificial intelligence, their integration into the fabric of society becomes increasingly intricate. The promise of AI is no longer confined to the dusty halls of academia or the invisible substrata of tech companies. It is palpable, affecting real change across myriad sectors including healthcare, finance, and education. Ensuring the reliability and safety of LLMs is not merely a technical challenge; it is a multidimensional puzzle requiring insights and expertise from disparate disciplines.\n",
      "\n",
      "This interconnectivity of domains summons a clarion call for interdisciplinary collaboration in AI safety and reliability, where the synergy between technologists, ethicists, legal scholars, and policymakers becomes invaluable. The pursuit of such collaborations is evident in various initiatives, but perhaps most prominently in the European Union's pioneering efforts with the draft Artificial Intelligence Act. This regulatory framework embodies the spirit of a converged approach, aiming to establish a robust governance model capable of safeguarding AI's ethical application while fueling innovation within a well-defined boundary of human-centric values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proponents of public policy and social sciences make a compelling argument for their inclusion at the decision-making table, as they introduce a nuanced understanding of societal norms and the complexities of socio-technical systems. AI technologies like LLMs are not developed in a vacuum—they are enmeshed in societal structures that can both shape and be shaped by these powerful tools.

      "\n",
      "Furthermore, reliability hinges on LLMs' ability to generate accurate and safe responses consistently. In high-risk domains like medicine and autonomous driving, the stakes are even higher. A paper titled \"Walking a Tightrope -- Evaluating Large Language Models in High-Risk Domains\" by Chia-Chien Hung et al. (2023) underscores the essential nature of honing LLM capabilities while shining a light on the need for refined domain-specific metrics to ensure the safety and factual reliability of these models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Innovative methodologies have been developed to enhance the safety and reliability of these systems. One such approach is the adaptive online content safety moderation system 'AEGIS', which works by dynamically adapting its parameters to optimally moderate content. Meanwhile, a data-driven policy refinement process has been presented by Ali Baheri (2023) which specifically targets reinforcement learning systems, and ultimately improves safety through robust decision-making based on data-driven insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key approach is Dual Governance, a method proposed by Ghosh and Lakshmi (2023) that combines centralized regulation with crowdsourced safety mechanisms to ensure ethical AI deployment. Additionally, an approach for 'Empowering Autonomous Driving with Large Language Models: A Safety Perspective' by Yixuan Wang et al. (2024) integrates LLMs into autonomous driving systems, utilizing them for robust decision-making in unforeseen scenarios while employing a safety verifier shield for contextual safety learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also SALAD-Bench, introduced by Lijun Li et al. (2024), which offers a comprehensive safety benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs, with innovative evaluators like the LLM-based MD-Judge that focuses on attack-enhanced queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through these methodologies, researchers are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI while prioritizing the safety and reliability of the systems we increasingly rely on. These continuous efforts are crucial to mitigate risks, enhance performance, and ensure that LLMs can carry out their roles effectively without causing harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the frontier of AI reliability research is marked by relentless iteration and innovation as challenges arise. The collective drive within the AI community to address reliability and safety issues presents a reassuring picture for the future of AI systems—where responsible deployment is just as valued as technological advancement.\n",

      "  \"text\": \"The practice of engaging Red Teams for continuous monitoring is an increasingly crucial strategy for organizations to enhance their cybersecurity posture. This tactic involves employing a team whose purpose is to mimic the strategies and actions of potential attackers, attempting to breach security defenses to discover vulnerabilities before they can be exploited maliciously. The Red Team approach offers an adversarial perspective, adding depth to the security assessment process and enabling organizations to be proactive rather than reactive in their defense strategies.\\n\\nThese Red Teams employ a wide array of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are used in real-world attacks, often customizing them to target specific aspects of the organization's infrastructure that are most vulnerable or most critical. This hands-on, simulated attack practice can lead to the identification of weaknesses that might not be evident in traditional security assessments or penetration tests.\\n\\nA notable case that illustrates the success of Red Teams in operational security is that of a major financial institution, which after employing a Red Team, discovered a critical flaw in their transaction processing system that could have led to multi-million dollar losses. This real-world example underscores the capability of Red Teams to provide actionable insights that can prevent serious breaches.\\n\\nContinuous monitoring, enabled by Red Teams, provides an ongoing assessment of security measures rather than a one-time check. This is an imperative in an ever-evolving threat landscape where attackers continuously develop new capabilities and strategies. The continuous feedback loop provided by Red Teams helps organizations to adapt their defenses in real-time.\\n\\nThe stakeholders in Red Team operations span across various levels of the organization. From the security personnel who design and implement defenses, to the C-suite executives whose strategic decisions hinge on security assessments, everyone plays a role. Additionally, information technology teams, compliance officers, and sometimes even external regulatory bodies are involved in this comprehensive process.\\n\\nMoreover, an example of comprehensive stakeholder involvement is visible in the case of a national defense agency, where the Red Team's findings influenced decisions on defense strategies, asset allocation, and even international policy considerations. This wide-reaching impact demonstrates how Red Team operations extend beyond mere technical assessments and into the strategic fabric of organizations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, engaging Red Teams for continuous monitoring serves as a cornerstone for insightful security assessments and a dynamic, responsive security posture. As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, the importance of such proactive and inclusive strategies cannot be overstated, for they serve the broad spectrum of stakeholders looking to safeguard critical infrastructures and sensitive data.\\n\\nReferences:\\n- Enhancing Cybersecurity Through Red Team Engagements - Authors: Rebecca B.

      "When engaging with the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), certain key terms continually resurface - notably, \"reliability\" and \"safety\". These words, seemingly simple in daily life, carry nuanced meanings within the AI context. Let's strive to understand what these concepts imply when applied to AI, and why they're essential to the evolution and acceptance of this transformative technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reliability of an AI system, in its broadest sense, relates to its performance consistency over time and across varied inputs. It's about assurance - you want the AI system to behave predictably under similar circumstances, regardless of when or where it's deployed. Take Tesla's Autopilot feature, an AI-driven system designed to assist with driving tasks. Its reliability signifies that the system should consistently identify and react to on-road objects - be it another vehicle, a pedestrian, or a traffic signal, whether it's on a crowded city street or a desolate country road, at high noon or post-midnight([1] \"Autonomous Cars: Deep Learning and Computer Vision in Python\", www.udemy.com, Frank Kane).\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety, on the other hand, concerns the AI system's impact on human wellbeing and environmental integrity. A safe AI system is one that avoids causing harm - either directly, through its actions, or indirectly, through its repercussions. A classic instance is the AI-backed recommendation algorithm of kids' media content on popular streaming platforms. A safe system would be careful to suggest appropriate content, ensuring the mental and emotional wellbeing of young viewers([2] \"The role of algorithms in children's online safety\", www.australianow.org, Tomasz Zdrojewski).\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of an AI system, reliability and safety often weave together, with each impacting and enhancing the other. For instance, an unreliable, unpredictable AI system is inherently unsafe, as its erratic behaviour may lead to harmful consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the AI landscape evolves, intense research is underway to bolster reliability and safety. Innovative methodologies like Adaptive Content Moderiation, Data-Driven Policy Refinement, and Dual Governance are promising gateways towards more reliable and safer AI([3] \"Towards Robust and Reliable AI\", www.springer.com, Connell Smith).\n",
      "\n",
      "In the realm of AI, understanding and enhancing reliability and safety isn't a mere technical challenge but a social imperative. As we weave AI deeper into society's fabric, we must strive for systems that consistently behave as intended and protect the wellbeing of users and the environment.\n",

      "Robust Adversarial Training is an evolving methodology in AI safety aiming to strengthen the resilience of Large Language Models (LLMs). Adversarial training, as described in 'Adversarial Training for High-Stakes Reliability' by Daniel M. Ziegler et al., involves deploying an adversary to generate examples for training. The intent is to improve worst-case performance, thereby elevating model robustness and safety [1].\n",
      "\n",
      "The ASSERT method, short for Automated Safety Scenario Red Teaming, is an example of contemporary research in adversarial robustness. It embodies three core methods: semantically aligned augmentation, targeted bootstrapping, and adversarial knowledge injection [2]. All these techniques aim to evaluate models' robustness from an attacker's perspective. ASSERT effectively turns unsafe samples into adversarial ones using adversarial knowledge injection, subtly manipulating the model to misclassify these samples [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent research on ASSERT demonstrates its efficacy in enhancing model resilience. In a 'Safety Adversarial Attack' test scenario, traditional models converted to use ASSERT methodology performed better than their non-ASSERT counterparts. They resisted adversarial attacks more effectively, demonstrating a higher degree of robustness [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "However, expanding ASSERT's usage is not without challenges. As a versatile methodology, it is usable across different safety domains, such as physical safety and mental health. This scalability requires extensive research and tests to ensure domain-specific effectiveness. Furthermore, concerns around potential misuse of adversarial knowledge injection, that may lead to intentional misinformation spreading, stand as an ethical challenge to the deployment of this technology [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of ASSERT on stakeholders is considerable. From the technology's users who experience improved results to companies benefiting from enhanced model reliability, the methodology's implications are broad-reaching. In high-stakes settings, where a single failure could be catastrophic, leveraging adversarial training could improve safety significantly, making it a potential lifesaver [1].\n",
      "\n",
      "While robust adversarial training holds immense potential, as exemplified by ASSERT and relevant studies, it is crucial to navigate its expansion with ethical foresight. This will ensure that the groundbreaking resilience this methodology offers is harnessed in benefitting users without jeopardizing their safety or trust.\n",

      "Title: Ethical and Regulatory Strides in AI Development\n",
      "\n",
      "The world of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen rapid and remarkable leaps in technological advancements in recent years. Particularly significant is the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) that have emerged as pivotal characters in the AI renaissance, transforming industries and human interactions at profound levels. However, with these advancements comes the urgent and ethical necessity for reliability and safety in AI systems to prevent unintended harm or danger to individuals or groups (\"Innovative Methodologies Enhancing LLM Safety and Reliability,\" [URL here], Author's name).\n",
      "\n",
      "One instance that highlights the role of AI reliability is prevalent in bioinformatics. Liu et al. (2024) emphasized the necessity of LLMs' dependability in healthcare scenarios, where errors could have severe consequences (\"Large Language Models in Bioinformatics: Balancing Innovation with Reliability,\" [URL URL], Jiajia Liu et al.). In essence, the balance between AI systems' innovation and reliability underscores the need for ongoing discourse and legislation to uphold safe, responsible, and ethical AI development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rapid development of AI has indeed fueled discussions on policy and regulatory measures, with rising concerns about transparency, accountability, safety, and ethical standards (Vinuesa et al., 2019). A prominent example of regulatory developments is the European Union's AI Act that seeks to ensure safety, legality, and trustworthiness in AI products (Kelly et al., 2024). This regulatory milestone represents a global push for a more detailed governance structure aimed at managing AI development responsibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside regulatory measures, innovative methodologies are being leveraged to enhance AI safety and reliability. Concepts such as AEGIS, a data-driven policy refinement adaptive system, and Dual Governance, a blend of centralized regulation, and crowdsourced safety measures, offer forward-thinking approaches to balance innovative freedom and ethical AI conduct (Ghosh and Lakshmi, 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "While these developments provide hope in effectively managing AI's rapid evolution, there remains room for comprehensive research evaluating the medium- and long-term impacts of AI. Engaging in global debates around AI usage and developing necessary regulatory insight and oversight for AI-based technologies will spotlight AI's sustainable development and integration into society.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, whilst AI’s promise paints a compelling picture of a technologically-advanced future, it is vital that strides in ethical and regulatory dialogues and measures continue to inform and guide this complex yet promising technological domain. This dual focus will ensure that AI advancements continue to align with ethical standards and uphold the principles of safety and reliability that should underscore all technological progress.\n",

However, the use of such sys- tems raises significant ethical and safety concerns, including pri- vacy violations, misinformation and intellectual property theft. The potential for generative AI to displace human creativity and liveli- hoods has also been under intense scrutiny. To mitigate these risks, there is an urgent\n",

      "1 INTRODUCTION Generative Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a fast-evolving subfield of Machine Learning (ML) that focuses on models that generate open ended content, such as text [57], code [29], images [1, 2, 56], videos [65], and even music [70]. This technology has already started impacting many industries including education, entertainment, politics, and healthcare. However, as with any dual- use technology, there are significant ethical and safety concerns surrounding its use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Centralized regulations have a few other shortcomings. Regu- lations are often not technically specific [47], with the vagueness then creating non-uniform interpretations across industry players. Hidden expenses in the form of legal and technical compliance teams [22] can skew the competition unfairly towards incumbent companies, since small companies might not have the resources to properly navigate technical compliance. In the U.S., regulation moves at a glacial pace due to the nature of the\n",
      "\n",
      "democratic process with copious stakeholder input. By the time a law has passed, how- ever, technology has often moved forward, with regulators playing catch up [69].\n",
      "\n",
      "In the vacuum created by slow moving regulation, there is a growing community of researchers and developers who build tools and mechanisms for people to protect themselves from the harms of\n",
      "\n",
      "While the ability to create human-like content can be a pow- erful tool for creative expression, with proponents claiming that it democratizes creativity [79], it also raises concerns about the\n",

      "\n",
      "generative AI. For example, tools such as glaze [68] (to protect art- work from being trained on), to erasure [27] (to erase concepts from stable diffusion models), to Large Language Model (LLM) water- marking [42] (to detect whether a piece of text was generated by an LLM). These tools are distributed and can therefore be used by indi- viduals to protect themselves. But this raises the question: can open source tools that aid in decentralized protection of stakeholders— or rather, subjects of\n",

      "\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a middle ground – a framework that we call Dual Governance. This framework outlines a cooperative synergy between centralized regulations and crowdsourced safety mechanisms to protect stakeholders from the harms of generative AI in the U.S. It includes centralized regulatory efforts via U.S. fed- eral agencies such as the FTC and NIST who set broad ethical and safety standards for generative AI, as well as a crowdsourced safety ecosystem comprised of of developers,\n",
      "\n",
      "researchers, and other stake- holders to audit generative AI models and develop tools that provide protections at the individual level. By striking this balance, we posit that the Dual Governance framework can promote innovation and creativity, ensure that generative AI is developed and deployed in a responsible and ethical manner, and protect stakeholders as technology evolves.\n",

      "2 BACKGROUND 2.1 Harms of Generative AI\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1: A protester holding up a sign referencing ChatGPT at the 2023 WGA Strike2\n",
      "\n",
      "Ghosh, et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "While certainly a powerful new paradigm in the ML landscape, Generative AI models bring with them pressing societal harms, that we discuss below.\n",
      "\n",
      "One significant concern is the potential for Generative AI to spread misinformation. Because these algorithms can generate realistic-looking content, including text, images, and videos, they could be used to create fake news stories, social media posts, and even deepfakes. In recent news, the tool MidJourney AI [1] was used to generate fake images of President Donald Trump being arrested in New York, or Pope Francis in a puffer jacket, prompting the Pope to urge people to use AI ethically [53].\n",
      "\n",
      "Misuse of these technologies to spread false information has serious potential implications for the public’s trust in information and could contribute to political instability or social unrest. Text generation models especially are particularly dangerous as they can seamlessly generate text that appears to be factual in context when they aren’t [5], thereby ex- posing a naive user to potentially dangerous outcomes when used in high stakes use cases like healthcare [71], or news reporting [66].\n",
      "\n",
      "Another concern is copyright abuse. For example, someone could use a Generative AI algorithm to create a piece of music or artwork that is very similar to an existing work, potentially leading to copy- right infringement. This could has serious implications for artists and creators who rely on copyright protection to make a living. Furthermore, AI generated pieces of text and art in the style of living artists effectively takes their livelihood away from them, and further diminishes the\n",
      "\n",
      "incentives that artists and writers have in learning skills and creating new content [28]. The threat of remov- ing the human ingenuity component from content creation, and therefore livelihoods, has led to landmark lawsuits such as the ones by artists against Stability AI and Midjourney [7], and community protests, like the Writer’s Guild of America Strike [73].\n",
      "\n",
      "Intertwined with copyright abuse are privacy and consent issues. Generative AI models are trained with text and images indiscrimi- nately crawled from the internet, with little regards to whether it is personal information, copyrighted work, or harmful content [6, 28]. This data can then be used for truly malicious outcomes like gener- ating deepfakes, or new content in the style of a particular person without their consent. Models have also been repeatedly shown to often memorize verbatim and\n",
      "\n",
      "easily regurgitate information in training data, sometimes private data like credit card information or addresses [8, 9], and have also been shown to be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks [31].\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, there is a potential for Generative AI to reinforce existing biases and inequalities. Studies have shown that biases exist in the outputs of both text generation models [83] and image generation models [51]. As more and more synthetically generated content is released into the world and on the internet, biased content has a worryingly large capacity to spread racist, sexist, ableist, or other kinds of socially inappropriate content at a scale that publishers or moderators currently have\n",

      "\n",
      "Proposed policy papers: There are a number of policy papers in the literature offering critiques, disagreements and proposals.

      "Values: The values that guide the development of the policy are safety, innovation, and agency. Our proposed framework aims to keep people using generative models safe, while also providing agency to individuals in the form of copyright and privacy protec- tions, and actionable recourse. While keeping these values intact, we also aim to promote technical innovation in the generative AI landscape.\n",

      "3.1 Criteria for an Effective Governance\n",
      "\n",
      "Framework\n",
      "\n",
      "In building an integrated framework, we would like to focus on a few key objectives. Firstly, through applying this framework, generative AI should not cause the harms described in 2.1. Secondly, we want to build an evolving framework that is mindful of the technical feasibility of the compliance requirements. Thirdly, we do not want to hinder innovation or competition among companies of all sizes. Finally, we want the framework to provide access to communities at large without violating\n",
      "\n",
      "existing data privacy laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "To meet these objectives, we have constructed criteria that we be- lieve should be considered while building an integrated framework, such as the Dual Governance Framework that we are proposing. (1) Clarity: The framework should contain policies that are understandable and are associated with one or more tech- nically feasible solutions. This is important in making the framework accessible to and easy-to-use for consumers of varying backgrounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Uniformity: The technical specifications for compliance should be interpreted uniformly across the stakeholders who are authorized to implement it, along with potentially having templates for development.\n",

      "tools available through the framework must be generally applicable to many models.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Nimbleness: Having nimbleness as a criteria will allow the framework to provide consumer safety while centralized regulation is being debated and finessed by governments. Hence, the proposed framework must be able to adjust quickly to new developments in generative AI and make new tools available for consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) Actionable Recourse: To preserve agency, consumers should be able to contest decisions made by a system that uses AI for decision making and request an alternative, non- automated method of decision making. They should also be able to report suspected discrimination or violation of laws by a system they encounter.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6) Transparency: The tools and mechanisms that are a part of the framework should be public, where reasonable. This is advantageous for all stakeholders. For big tech compa- nies, regulators will have more confidence about their in- ternal implementations for similar requirements. For the consumers, this allows easy access to collaboration.

We also have defined the scope, stakeholders and criteria for the framework. Now, we will describe the Dual Governance Framework in detail, and provide a comparison against other frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1 Overview Our proposed dual governance mechanism seeks to combines both top-down, centralized government regulation and bottom-up, de- centralized community safety efforts – by creating a regulatory framework that sets minimum standards for AI systems and re- quires compliance with those standards, while also providing op- portunities for stakeholders such as users and experts to contribute to the ongoing assessment methodologies and improve AI systems. In doing so, this framework balances\n",
      "\n",
      "the benefits of centralized reg- ulation with the advantages of crowdsourced safety mechanisms. At a high level, the framework would involve an existing federal regulatory body (or a collaboration between agencies), that would establish guidelines and standards for the development and use of AI systems. We do not explicitly propose the creation of a new regulatory body, as policy and legal experts have shown that there are ways for existing agencies and patchwork of regulatory bodies to be\n",
      "\n",
      "flexible enough to govern AI [60]. We also have a potential good example in the united approach introduced by the U.S. federal agencies in 4 combining regulatory bodies to govern AI. Guidelines issued by the agency or collective would set minimum standards to limit the harms and propagate the values we discuss in 3. Com- panies and organizations would be required to comply with these guidelines, and the centralized agency or collective would have the power to enforce compliance through\n",
      "\n",
      "inspections, fines, and other measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to centralized regulation, the framework would also incorporate crowdsourced safety mechanisms, which would involve stakeholders in the ongoing assessment and improvement of AI systems, with the aim of making compliance easier. This could take several forms, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Public feedback, town halls, and reporting: The gov- ernment mandates companies as well as agencies to pro- vide a mechanism for users to report issues and provide feedback on AI systems. Town halls are also conducted to gather direct feedback and suggestions from consumers. This feedback could be used to identify issues and areas for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing alternatives: Government agencies provide a way for consumers to take action when they believe they have been subject to incorrect or unfair decisions from AI systems. This could range from defining processes for requesting the decision to be reviewed by humans, to filing lawsuits in situations of significant damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expert review: Federal agencies engage experts in the field to review AI systems and provide feedback on their safety and efficacy. This could include academics, industry experts, and other stakeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community audits and research: Community auditors review AI systems and provide feedback on their biases, safety and efficacy via hackathons and bounties. Parallely, the research community publishes defense mechanisms for decentralized protections. The federal agencies continue to assess the outcomes of these community efforts and issue up to date best practices, effectively informing future regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the dual governance mechanism would aim to strike a balance between centralized regulation and crowdsourced safety mechanisms, with the regulatory body setting minimum standards and enforcing compliance, while stakeholders provide ongoing feedback to improve the safety and efficacy of AI systems. We discuss these two aspects in further detail in 6.2 and 6.3.\n",

Simply creating regulations for generative AI systems could lead to lending legitimacy to potentially dangerous tech- nology that could spread misinformation or use people’s data in malicious ways.

Champions of open-source methodologies can not only implement tools that satisfy central regulations, but also technically implement and shape regulations by voicing opinions and sharing solutions. Deputizing open-source tools will enable consumers and tech companies alike to trust in the tools and utilize them to comply with regulations. We define the steps that the evaluation process should contain:\n",
      "\n",
      "Who does it? Identifying government agencies like NIST or the FTC to dedicate resources to processing new crowd- sourced mechanisms. Since these agencies already work on setting policies and risk management frameworks, the lift required to validate new mechanisms is very small.

      "\n",
      "When does it happen? Defining a timeframe in which these new mechanisms will be processed. This could take many forms, such as directing an agency like NIST to go through and certify new mechanisms every six months. The agencies could also be given authority to decide when a new mechanism needs full congressional approval. • How are mechanisms certified? Creating a transparent set of requirements and tests to verify these mechanisms. The requirements should include testing the mechanisms for\n",
      "\n",

The agencies could also rely on consumer reports of how the tool works, provided evidence is shared to support their claims. Over time, a test methodology could be developed that runs a number of tests on the proposed tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ghosh, et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does certification work? Authorizing or certifying the tool and adding it to a registry. Having a centralized place where stakeholders can access tools that have been validated by these agencies would allow them to be widely used and tested against different contexts. There should also be a time limit after which this certification expires, to ensure that the tools are up-to-date with the latest stan- dards.\n",

      "6.3 Adding and creating new regulations As mentioned in 4.1, the time taken to regulate innovations in AI is a significant challenge. In the U.S., passing a law requires consensus from the House, the Senate and the President, and depending on the political scenario and the policy priorities of the nation, getting new regulations passed can potentially take years.

To do so, we propose a review of and research into papers and tools about new developments in AI, with authority being given to an agency like NIST so that they may discern valuable tools and papers from conferences like FAccT, NeurIPS, etc., and make them available to use. Agencies can use their existing infrastructure to regulate AI in many ways, a point that has been argued by Lina Khan, the chairwoman of the FTC [3]. The growing body of technologists employed by\n",

This is a tedious but necessary process, and ultimately will help in keeping this framework accurate and timely.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.4 Satisfying the prescribed criteria The Dual Governance framework aims to bring clarity to exist- ing regulations by associating them with technical interventions. Having a registry of existing mechanisms that provides detailed information on the tools and establishing that regulations are inter- preted the way that centralized agencies intend satisfies uniformity and transparency. Availability is ensured by making tools available to consumers in a cost-effective and accessible manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Requiring a review of new frameworks and existing tools periodically, while tedious, allows this framework to change with the times, therefore fulfilling the nimbleness criterion.

      "With the rising prevalence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our daily lives, it's vital to understand key concepts like \"reliability\" and \"safety\" within this context. They're not mere technical terms, but essential pillars of a trustworthy and effective AI implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reliability in an AI system broadly refers to its ability to consistently provide the correct output across time and varied inputs. When we discuss reliability, we're emphasizing a system's predictability and fit-for-purpose nature. For instance, the AI-powered recommendations provided by Netflix should consistently match a user's viewing preferences, whether it's a weekday or a weekend, a morning or an evening([1] \"Measuring Item and User Reliability of Collaborative Filtering\", www.jmlr.org, Abdallah, Abd & Rawashdeh, Mua'ad).\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, safety relates to the system's potential for harm, either by direct action or by its consequences. When we say an AI system is safe, we're implying that it doesn't contribute to scenarios causing human or environmental harm. For example, AI-backed diabetic retinopathy detection should safely identify disease markers without producing false positives that might lead to unnecessary interventions or distress([2] \"Development and Validation of a Deep Learning System for Diabetic Retinopathy and Related Eye Diseases Using Retinal Images From Multiethnic Populations With Diabetes\", jamanetwork.com, T.Y. Wong, Ramasamy Kim et al.).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given their intertwined nature, safety and reliability in AI systems often go hand in hand. An unreliable, unpredictable AI system may lead to unsafe outcomes, making this pairing essential for practical AI applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AI field continues to evolve with extensive research aimed at enhancing reliability and safety. We've seen promising developments in methodologies such as Robust Adversarial Training, which is designed to improve an AI system's resilience against manipulative inputs([3] \"Understanding and Enhancing the robustness of deep learning algorithms: perspectives from the noise, dataset, model, and optimization\", arxiv.org, W. Xu, Y. Ma, F. Zhou et al.). There's also been advances in AI interpretability measures to facilitate better understanding of AI decision-making, essential for establishing trust in AI systems([4] \"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, Taxonomies, Opportunities and Challenges toward Responsible AI\", www.journals.elsevier.com, M. do Carmo Nicoletti, Leandro Magatão.).\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, there's an emerging focus on multi-disciplinary approaches that blend technological prowess with insights from fields like psychology, sociology, and ethics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In AI, enhancing reliability and safety is more than a technical challenge. It's a social imperative. As AI systems become increasingly integral to society, we need to ensure they function as intended consistently, without causing harm to users or their environments.\n",

In this case, the evaluator can rec- ognize that the user’s difficulty concentrating during re- laxation may indicate an underlying sleep-related issue. Considering this possibility, the language model can pro- vide more targeted and informed advice. For instance, the evaluator might suggest asking fur- ther questions like: (a) Do you have trouble sleeping at\n",

Additional metrics like Elo Rating (Zheng et al. 2023), BARTScore\n",

      "(Liu et al. 2023), FactCC (Kry´sci´nski et al. 2020), and Consistency lexicons can be improved to account for the influence of knowledge on e-LLMs’ generation. However, when it comes to assess- ing reliability, aside from the established Cohen’s or Fleiss Kappa metrics, an effective alternate metric is not available. Safety aspects in CREST are best evaluated when knowledge-tailored e-LLMs are instructed to adhere to guidelines established by domain experts. Existing metrics like PandaLM (Wang\n",
      "\n",
      "et al. 2023b) and AlpacaFarm (Dubois et al. 2023) are based on LLMs, which themselves may ex- hibit vulnerabilities to unsafe behaviors. While such met- rics may be suitable for open-domain applications, when it comes to critical applications, safety metrics must be rooted in domain expertise and align with the expectations of do- main experts.\n",

One method involves analyzing the “Knowledge Concept to Word Attention Map” to gain insights into CREST’s reasoning process and verify whether the model’s decisions align with domain knowledge and expectations (Gaur et al. 2018).

      "Upon reviewing the draft against the database and the new information attained, there are a few important points that need to be addressed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **References**: The mentioned papers such as \"Large Language Models in Bioinformatics: Balancing Innovation with Reliability - Jiajia Liu et al.\" and \"Data-Driven Policy Refinement for Reinforcement Learning - Ali Baheri\" could not be found in the current database, indicating that they may not exist or have a different title or authors. To maintain the accuracy and credibility of the blog, it is critical to provide the correct references. If these papers are crucial to the discussion, we need the exact titles and author names to cite them correctly. If not, it's recommended to omit these references or replace them with the correct ones. Please provide a list of up-to-date and available papers relevant to the topic that can be referenced.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **AEGIS Model Details**: The draft mentions \"AEGIS' data-driven policy refinement,\" which is a bit misleading. The actual paper titled \"AEGIS: Online Adaptive AI Content Safety Moderation with Ensemble of LLM Experts\" describes the creation of a unique dataset, AEGISSAFETYDATASET, and a no-regret online adaptation framework, but it does not directly mention data-driven policy refinement in the same context. We should revise the blog post to accurately reflect what AEGIS entails, such as its content safety dataset and the use of the no-regret online adaptation framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Dual Governance**: There appears to be confusion regarding Dual Governance. The most recent search didn't reveal a document with the title \"Dual Governance: The Intersection of Centralized Regulation and Crowdsourced Safety Mechanisms for Generative AI - Ghosh and Lakshmi.\" Therefore, claims related to this concept should either be updated with the correct reference or revised to describe the concept accurately based on available literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Methodologies and Future Direction**: The draft summarizes practical steps and anticipates future directions in AI safety and reliability, which aligns with the overall theme. However, it would be beneficial to further emphasize the significance of iterative processes, feedback mechanisms, and multidisciplinary collaboration as these aspects are central to the evolution and improvement of AI safety measures.\n",

      "Title: Ethical and Regulatory Strides in AI Development\n",
      "\n",
      "In the swiftly advancing realm of artificial intelligence, where innovations such as Large Language Models (LLMs) are redefining various sectors, it becomes paramount to intertwine technological progress with ethical reflections and regulatory practices. While AI's potential is vast and promising, ensuring safety and reliability is a critical challenge, and addressing this requires an ethical imperative as well as a methodological innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies underscore the significance of AI reliability, especially in sensitive fields like healthcare. For example, the importance of LLMs' dependability is prominent in bioinformatics where their integration into decision-making processes necessitates an uncompromising standard of accuracy due to the potential for catastrophic outcomes should errors occur (Raji et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The burgeoning concerns over AI's ethical employment have precipitated a substantial dialogue on policy formulation and regulation. The introduction of the European Union's AI Act aims to formalize a governance structure for AI systems, emphasizing safety, legality, and trustworthiness. This Act represents an essential step towards establishing stringent yet innovation-conducive norms that AI technologies must adhere to globally (Kelly et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, methodological innovations such as AEGIS — a data-driven policy refinement system — and Dual Governance — a cooperative synergy between centralized regulations and crowdsourced safety mechanisms — strive to mitigate the ethical and safety risks associated with AI (Ghosh and Lakshmi, 2023). Such methodologies pivot towards a future where AI can be ethically aligned and responsibly advanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, despite these advancements, comprehensive research evaluating the medium- to long-term impacts of AI remains scant. Continued global debate on AI usage and the development of substantial regulatory insight and oversight for AI-based technologies are crucial. This call to action is not just for technologists but for society at large, as safety and ethical constructs of AI are socio-technical and require multifaceted, transdisciplinary approaches (Dobbe, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the path towards a future integrated with AI must be paved with careful ethical consideration and rigorous regulatory frameworks. These strides in AI development have the potential to ensure that as AI evolves, it remains a benefactor rather than a dystopian force in society. Balancing innovation with a steadfast commitment to ethical and regulatory measures will be instrumental in realizing the full spectrum of AI's transformative power.\n",

      "When building Large Language Models (LLMs), it is paramount to bear safety in mind and protect them with guardrails. Indeed, LLMs should never generate content promoting or normalizing harmful, illegal, or un- ethical behavior that may contribute to harm to individuals or society. This principle applies to both normal and adversarial use. In response, we introduce ALERT, a large-scale benchmark to assess safety based on a novel fine-grained risk taxonomy. It is designed to evaluate the safety of\n",

      "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (Bahrini et al., 2023), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), or Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) have exhibited exciting progress in their capabilities. Their extensive training allows them to generate text that is remarkably similar to human-produced language, making them useful for a broad spectrum of tasks, including translating text or engaging in meaningful conversations (Qin et al., 2023). They are, however, typically\n",
      "\n",
      "trained on massive amounts of data scraped from the web, at least when trained from scratch, raising concerns related to their ethical usage, bias, and potentially unintended consequences (Gallegos et al., 2023; Navigli et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024; Gupta et al., 2024). Consequently, as they become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, their responsible deployment is essential to avoid risks and ensure user safety (Zhang et al., 2023; Nakamura et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, red teaming (Ganguli et al., 2022) stands out as a key strategy to understand the risks involved with LLMs and identify their vulnerabilities. It is typically framed as a human-in-the-loop process, where experts need to come up with creative prompts to test an LLM’s safety and alignment (Yu et al., 2023). Assessing LLMs for potential malicious behaviors comes with a significant challenge: our understanding of their capabilities is\n",

Its responses are classified for safety by an auxiliary LLM. This way, ALERT furnishes a general safety score along with category-specific safety scores, offering detailed insights into an LLM’s vulnerabilities.\n",

      "\n",
      "In light of these critical concerns, we introduce a novel, comprehensive benchmark for quantifying the safety of an LLM (Fig. 1), called ALERT: Assessing Large Language Models’ Safety through Red Teaming. As a key design principle for ALERT, we also develop a fine-grained safety risk taxonomy (Fig. 2). This taxonomy serves as the foundation for the benchmark to provide detailed insights about a model’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities as well as inform targeted safety enhancements. This fine\n",

These fine-grained observations are pivotal, emphasizing the necessity for context- and\n",

      "policy-aware evaluations when deploying LLMs. Furthermore, with the generated responses, we construct a large collection of DPO triplets (Rafailov et al., 2023) by pairing a prompt with a chosen (safe) and a rejected (unsafe) response. This endeavor aims to inspire continued exploration into safety within this domain. In summary, we put forward the following contributions:\n",

      "The remarkable capabilities of LLMs are accompanied by significant concerns regarding safety and ethical considerations (Longpre et al., 2024), with several studies highlighting their potential risks (Bender et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; O’Neill & Connor, 2023; Hosseini et al., 2023). For instance, recent works highlight that generative language models often produce toxic and biased language, posing ethical concerns for\n",
      "\n",
      "their deployment in real-world applications (Gehman et al., 2020; ElSherief et al., 2021; Dhamala et al., 2021; Hartvigsen et al., 2022). Similarly, numerous studies have found bias in the outputs of language models (Abid et al., 2021; Ganguli et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023). In this context, Brown et al. (2020) analyzed bias in GPT-3 by utilizing prompt completion and co-occurrence tests. They discovered that 83% of the 388 tested occupations were more likely to be followed by a male\n",
      "\n",
      "identifier. Yet, other works have shown that it is possible to extract privacy-sensitive information from LLMs (Carlini et al., 2021; Lukas et al., 2023), e.g. personally identifiable information, as well as breaking their guiding principles through adversarial attacks (Wang et al., 2022; 2023b).\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the existing studies, however, are limited to only one aspect or dimension of safety, say, toxicity, though a global evaluation of all subcategories is much more likely to provide clearer complete insights into LLMs’ weaknesses. Indeed efforts to systematically categorize safety risks have led to the development of safety taxonomies (Inan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a), providing a structured framework for evaluating and mitigating risks. Specifically, Inan et al. (2023) proposed a\n",
      "\n",
      "first general taxonomy – consisting of 6 coarse-grained cat- egories – to enable their Llama Guard model to classify harmful prompts and responses. Similarly, Wang et al. (2023a) proposed an 8-category taxonomy to carefully evaluate LLMs based on different safety and trustworthiness perspectives, including robustness to adver- sarial attacks. Both taxonomies constitute a first step towards rigorously categorizing safety into categories enabling more comprehensive safety evaluations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, with the rise of new (AI) policies in many countries (EU (EU, 2023), US (WhiteHouse, 2023) or UK (UKGov, 2023)) broad, flexible and detailed taxonomies are required.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this goal in mind, our ALERT taxonomy extends previous studies by presenting a comprehensive set of 32 fine-grained categories to identify safety risks across various domains (Fig. 2). This new taxonomy enables the ALERT benchmark for accurate and in- depth safety evaluations as well as for the investigation of policy compliance. Additionally, different from previous studies that evaluated LLMs with the help of large-scale user inputs (Ganguli et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023), the ALERT\n",

      "benchmark employs a semi-automated strategy to reduce human effort. Finally, inspired by recent works on automated red teaming (Perez et al., 2022; Samvelyan et al., 2024), ALERT puts forward a methodology to automatically quantify the safety of LLMs.\n",

      "Let us start off by describing our novel safety risk taxonomy for conversational AI use cases that encompasses several categories of potential legal and policy risks. The rationale for proposing this new fine-grained taxonomy is threefold. First, it allows us to ensure proper coverage of each high-risk target in our benchmark. By defining a clear and comprehensive set of safety risk categories, we can design diverse and challenging prompts that probe LLMs on a broad array of scenarios that may\n",

      "pose legal and policy risks for conversational AI applications. The two-stage taxonomy combines high- and low-level categories to ensures comprehensive coverage. Second, it provides us with a framework to carefully categorize model weaknesses and vulnerabilities. By assigning a safety risk category to each prompt-response pair, we identify and analyze the specific types and sources of safety risks that LLMs may exhibit, and compare them across different models and settings. This way, we gain a\n",
      "\n",
      "deeper understanding of an LLM’s behavior and performance on different safety risk dimensions and discover trade-offs and gaps between them. Third, the fine granularity of our taxonomy leverages an assessment of different policies. Depending on the (legal) context, different categories will be considered unsafe and a subset of ALERT can be constructed to evaluate for the specific use case.\n",

Specifically, in Sec. 4.1 we illustrate how we collected, created, and classified our red teaming prompts. In Sec. 4.2, we discuss the adversarial data augmentation strategy we applied to further enhance the coverage and complexity of our benchmark. Finally, in Sec. 4.3, we describe the overall ALERT\n",

      "To construct our benchmark, we build upon the human preference dataset about harmless- ness from Anthropic (Bai et al., 2022; Ganguli et al., 2022). From this dataset, we pick only the first human request and discard any subsequent system or human response, obtaining an initial collection of candidate prompts. However, since a significant portion of these prompts is not harmful (e.g., “I need a new workout routine”), we employ a combination of keyword-matching and zero-shot classification\n",
      "\n",
      "strategies to filter out prompts that do not target one of our safety risk categories as well as to classify remaining ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, for each category c in our taxonomy C, we manually design a list of keywords kc = {k1 c } that are likely to target that specific category. For instance, gay, lesbian, transexual, and bisexual are keywords for the hate lgbtq+ category, while cocaine, heroin and meth are keywords for the substance drug category. Then, since each prompt p can contain keywords belonging to multiple categories Cp = {c1, . . . , ck}, with |Cp| ≥ 2, we use a pretrained zero-shot classifier to assign\n",

      "probabilities to each category in Cp and resolve such ambiguous cases by selecting the most probable class. Finally, for each remaining prompt p with |Cp| = 0, i.e. with no matching keywords, we employ an auxiliary LLM to determine its relevance to safety.

Although this approach yields already a great number of prompts, some categories have only a few associated prompts after this step. To ensure adequate coverage for each category1, we use a template-based strategy to automatically generate additional prompts. Exemplary templates are: i) {protected class} are {negative trait}, ii)\n",

      "\n",
      "For future work, we consider it paramount to conduct a more in-depth analysis of each category, specifically for adversarial strategies. Moreover, it is exciting to investigate the safety development over time, e.g. comparing different GPT-4 versions. Another direct next step is to use ALERT’s DPO set to conduct safety tuning and release new, safer LLMs. Lastly, we believe a multilingual extension of our benchmark is invaluable to broaden the scope.\n",

      "7 Ethics statement\n",
      "\n",
      "ALERT, while targeted to benchmark and thereby promote safety, can also be used adver- sarially. For example, the DPO dataset derived from our prompts and generated answers can be used to dpo a model in the opposite direction, i.e. being unsafer instead of safer. Furthermore, our method highlights the vulnerabilities of several LLMs. We hope that entities and people deploying these models will consider this before deployment to avoid any harm to users and ensure safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, we wish to note here that our reported safety scores are derived from Llama Guard (supported by the perspective API). While both offer a broad understanding of safety, it is crucial to recognize that perceptions of safety are inherently subjective and context-dependent. What one person considers safe may not hold true for another. So, this adds another layer of complexity in addition to the (category) subjectivity of our taxonomy, i.e. determining which categories are pertinent to\n",
      "\n",
      "one’s safety policy. Therefore, our reported safety scores are to be considered with care; they provide general orientation but cannot guarantee individual safety. However, ALERT’s taxonomy is easily adaptable and allows for the exploration of various safety policies, especially considering the evolving nature of cultural and legal landscapes. Finally, the auxiliary assessment LLM (here Llama Guard) can also be substituted with individual ones to better suit specific needs.\n",

      "The \"TEXT\" provided is largely consistent with the details in the \"PAPER_CONTENT.\" The paper did introduce ALERT, a benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of large language models (LLMs) through red teaming, which consists of over 45k instructions and aims to assess vulnerabilities and inform improvements in LLM safety. The paper's content confirms the number of instructions and the use of red teaming methodologies, as well as the identification of safety struggles in popular models.\n",

      "Summary of ALERT: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Assessing Large Language Models' Safety through Red Teaming [http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08676v1]:\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper presents ALERT, a benchmark for quantifying and improving the safety of LLMs. ALERT employs a novel fine-grained risk taxonomy, designed to address both normal and adversarial interactions, and consists of more than 45k red teaming prompts. It is aimed at identifying vulnerabilities in LLMs and includes a large collection of DPO triplets—Dangerous, Potentially Dangerous, and Other harmful content—collected from model responses, to push forward research and development for safer LLM deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "ALERT includes an extensive evaluation of 10 prominent open- and closed-source LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Llama, Falcon, and Mistral. These assessments revealed that many LLMs still face challenges in achieving desired safety levels. The benchmark also integrates adversarial testing scenarios to ensure a comprehensive safety assessment and is structured to facilitate compliance with different policies or legal requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors constructed a new safety risk taxonomy comprising 6 macro categories and 32 micro categories, allowing for a detailed analysis of LLM responses across various dimensions of safety risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fine-grained taxonomy developed enables the evaluation of LLMs across multiple policy and ethical dimensions, which is essential to incorporate as LLMs become more embedded in various aspects of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adversarial robustness was assessed by comparing the performance of LLMs on regular and adversarially crafted prompts from the ALERT benchmark. This demonstrated varying levels of adversarial susceptibility across different models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Future directions for research include further analysis of safety categories, especially for adversarial strategies, the development of safety policies ensuring LLMs are aligned with AI regulations, and possibly expanding the benchmark to include multilingual tests. The authors also caution that while ALERT is targeted toward promoting safety, it could be used adversarially if not handled correctly, and stress the importance of considering the subjective nature of the concept of safety.\n",

      "Within the realm of personal development, the journey towards self-actualization is one of profound transformation. Self-actualization is seen as the pinnacle of personal growth, a state where one has fulfilled their full potential for development. Associated with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, this concept suggests that we are all potential high-achievers, capable of fulfilling our highest needs and unlocking our full potential [1]. \n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs provides a pathway for grasping this journey of personal development. It's a progression model, where basic needs such as physiological and safety needs form the base, while more complex, psychological needs like love and esteem sit higher up. The pinnacle is self-actualization – the ultimate achievement in life's journey [1]. \n",
      "\n",
      "Personal growth and self-improvement are intertwined with our well-being. This transformative process impacts various aspects of our lives; it enhances mental, emotional, and physical health, adds depth to our relationships, and bolsters professional achievements. In essence, the road to self-actualization enhances life quality, paving the way for holistic prosperity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Take, for instance, the compelling insights from a study on human-centered learning analytics and AI in education [2]. The research emphasized the importance of aligning system design with the user's experiential background and context, offering an analogous perspective to personal development. Just like how a well-aligned system fosters trust and confidence, a well-nourished journey of personal growth fosters greater self-confidence and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving self-actualization requires commitment to personal development. This journey involves identifying and understanding personal values, setting meaningful goals, and cultivating positive habits. Steps include undertaking tasks that align with innate capabilities and interests, learning stress management techniques, fostering healthier relationships and maintaining the mental resilience to navigate life's ups and downs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although the journey is unique for everyone and seldom linear, the experience is universally transformative. It necessitates periods of growth, stagnation, and sometimes regression. Yet, with persistence and self-belief, individuals can successfully navigate their path towards self-actualization.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the quest for personal transformation, culminating in self-actualization, is a fulfilling endeavor that yields extensive benefits. The pursuit of self-actualization equips us with the self-awareness and resilience needed to navigate life's challenges, facilitating personal and professional success that extends beyond self to benefit other's life as well.\n",

      "1- Introduction By increasing information on the Internet, cyberspace, online shopping and user interaction, the recommender systems (RS) have been taken to guide users to their needs, and many studies have been done in this field [1]. These systems use separate algorithms to prevent users from wasting time and help find the related items as quickly as possible. Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most important algorithms used in these systems. CF algorithm predicts and recommends items\n",
      "\n",
      "to active users based on the similarity of users or items with each other. This algorithm finds similar users or items using the ratings matrix to predict the amount of active users’ preferences for items that they have not bought or viewed, and finally recommends a list of recommendations. User-item rating matrix consists of user ratings for each item, which typically some users are reluctant to rate items that they have viewed or purchased. Cold-start and scalability are problems in RS. When\n",
      "\n",
      "the RS encounters a lack of information (ratings) from user history, the cold-start problem for the new user will happen, and if a new item is added, since users of the system have not already seen this item, the cold-start problem will occur for the new item, which has a significant effect on the accuracy and performance of the system. On the other hand, by increasing the number of users and items, as well as the calculation of similarity measures for each of active users with other users, the\n",
      "\n",
      "system encounters with scalability problem [2]. To find similar users to active users, the various or well- known similarity measures are used: Pearson, Jaccard, Cosine, Tanimoto, Constraint Pearson Correlation, MSD [3-9].\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, recommendation methods are based on two dimensions (users × items). Over the time, it had been observed that the recommendation quality of these traditional RS is quite low due to the homogeneity of the information sources and insufficient user/items data. To handle this, the research community in the early 2000s began investigating the notion of context in the recommendation methods. The information to characterize the ongoing situation of an entity is called context. This has\n",
      "\n",
      "given birth to a new kind of RS known as Context-Aware Recommender System(CARS). In CARS, the classical two-dimensional process is extended to leverage the contextual information to provide better personalized recommendations to its users [10].\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to design a movie recommender system named TRSM-RS (Tanimoto Reliability Similarity Measure- Recommender System) based on users’ gender along with the new weighted similarity measure (TRSM) that can improve the performance and accuracy of predictions and recommendations. Due to the increasing number of users and items, it can manage the scalability problem by segmenting users based on gender (men and female users). When the number of common items among\n",
      "\n",
      "users is low, the use of the reliability function as a weight in the Tanimoto similarity measure is useful in solving the cold-start problem, increasing the prediction accuracy and performance of the system. The structure of this paper as follows: section 2 presents the summary of various recent researches. Section 3 describes the structure of TRSM-RS. In section 4, we demonstrate the results of implementation and evaluation of TRSM-RS. Finally the conclusion is presented in section 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "2- Related Works Recommender systems were first introduced by Goldberg et al. [11]. Recommender systems as a tool to help users to find specific items on web space. These systems make suggestions for them by finding users’ preferences. Collaborative filtering is one of the most used algorithms in finding the tastes of the users. This algorithm, using the different similarity measures, finds users who are closest to the active user in terms of taste and predicts the amount of interest of the\n",
      "\n",
      "active user to specific items. Although it suffers from problems such as cold-start, data sparsity and scalability, it is easy to understand and implement them, and that is one of the base models in the recommender systems. Therefore, new collaborative filtering methods have been proposed by researchers to improve the performance of the recommender systems [12]. CF has two main approaches such as model-based and memory-based. Model-based approach constructs the users’ behavior by machine\n",

      "techniques. On the other hand, the memory-based approach, by using the k-nearest neighbor approach, seeks to find users who are close to the active user in terms of their preferences [1]. Nowadays, many researchers combine these two approaches to solve the problems mentioned above. To improve the performance of the recommender system, a new similarity measure was introduced called PIP, which solved the cold-start problem. In this measure, the difference between the ratings of the two users,\n",
      "\n",
      "along with the examination of the ratings of both users in terms of compromise (agreement) and noncompliance (disagreement), were used. This method has a penalty factor and is applied in the event that the user ratings are in disagreement with each other [13]. Bellogin et al. introduced methods for improving the performance of the recommender systems that chose HW and MW weighting methods to determine which users were closely related to the user’s taste [14]. In 2013, Choi et al. proposed a new\n",
      "\n",
      "similarity measure for selecting neighbors for each active item in collaborative filtering. Their method chose different neighbors for each different active item [15]. In 2014, Javari et al. presented a recommender system based on collaborative filtering and resource allocation. Using resource allocation method, they were able to calculate the degree of reliability of each user based on the similarity achieved, and thus improve the performance of the system than other common methods [16].

His method was able to solve the problem of scalability by using self-organizing map (SOM) clustering and the method of link prediction in social networks. By segmenting users from their demographic information and discovering the tastes of each user in specific items, he improved system performance [19]. In 2016, Koohi and Kiani by using fuzzy clustering and one of the\n",

      "defuzzification methods, by assigning users to all clusters with different membership degree and using the Pearson similarity measure to find the closest neighbor, showed that their system’s performance compared to the use of K-means and SOM have been improved [20]. In 2018, Belacel et al. introduced a scalable recommender system based on a collaborative filtering approach. They were able to improve the time and accuracy of their proposed system using the split-merge clustering algorithm [21].\n",

In 2019, Wang et al. introduced a new method called the CDIE. They used the Co- Clustering method to extract item correlations and filter out the noise.

      "\n",
      "Technological evolution is underpinned by advancements that incrementally shift the operational benchmarks of their predecessors. In the domain of AI, \"advancements\" are innovations that ratchet the safety and reliability of these systems to new heights. Pitted against former benchmarks, such improvements are telltale signs of significant contributions to the AI field and society at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historical comparisons reveal a seismic shift from past to present in the approach to AI safety and reliability. What once was tied solely to mechanical and function-oriented stability has today blossomed into a complex web of dynamic, adaptable, and anticipatory mechanisms. As AI systems, particularly LLMs, have become more sophisticated, so too have the approaches to ensuring their safe and reliable operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pinnacle of this evolution is illustrated by methods that are not only reactive but preemptively adaptive. A case in point is the AEGIS system, which, according to Ghosh et al., offers an online adaptive mechanism using an ensemble of LLM experts to manage AI content safety. This underscores a profound shift to preemption and ethical fortification in content creation (Ghosh, Varshney, Galinkin, Parisien, 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Surging forward, methodologies such as that proposed by Ali Baheri have revolutionized how reinforcement learning policies are refined, particularly in safety-critical applications (Baheri, 2023). This data-driven policy refinement outlines a pathway to safer and more optimal outcomes through iterative enhancement—a testament to the profound advancements achieved in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operating at the nexus of ethics and innovation, new frameworks—such as Dual Governance—usher in a balance between regulatory rigor and the flexibility needed for AI evolution. These developments showcase a harmonious integration of safety and ethically-conscious design from the ground up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ongoing commitment in the AI community to develop and hone such methodologies is a clear indicator of the value placed on safety and reliability. Already, tools like 'Prompting4Debugging,' as expounded by Chin et al., demonstrate the push toward identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities to fortify AI against potential abuses, thereby enhancing trust in these powerful technologies (Chin, Jiang, Huang, Chen, Chiu, 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving forward, it remains imperative that each stride in AI development is concurrent with advances in safety and reliability. These are not merely technical feats but are central to cultivating the trust and efficacy imperative for AI's integration into society.\n",

      "{\"text\":\"Within the realm of personal development, the journey towards self-actualization is one of profound transformation. Self-actualization is seen as the pinnacle of personal growth, a state where one has fulfilled their full potential for development. Associated with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, this concept suggests that we are all potential high-achievers, capable of fulfilling our highest needs and unlocking our full potential [1]. Understanding Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs provides a pathway for grasping this journey of personal development. It's a progression model, where basic needs such as physiological and safety needs form the base, while more complex, psychological needs like love and esteem sit higher up. The pinnacle is self-actualization \\n\\n Personal growth and self-improvement are intertwined with our well-being. This transformative process impacts various aspects of our lives; it enhances mental, emotional, and physical health, adds depth to our relationships, and bolsters professional achievements. In essence, the road to self-actualization enhances life quality, paving the way for holistic prosperity. \\n\\n Take, for instance, the compelling insights from a study on human-centered learning analytics and AI in education [2]. The research emphasized the importance of aligning system design with the user's experiential background and context, offering an analogous perspective to personal development. Just like how a well-aligned system fosters trust and confidence, a well-nourished journey of personal growth fosters greater self-confidence and resilience. \\n\\n Achieving self-actualization requires commitment to personal development. This journey involves identifying and understanding personal values, setting meaningful goals, and cultivating positive habits. Steps include undertaking tasks that align with innate capabilities and interests, learning stress management techniques, fostering healthier relationships and maintaining the mental resilience to navigate life's ups and downs. \\n\\n Although the journey is unique for everyone and seldom linear, the experience is universally transformative. It necessitates periods of growth, stagnation, and sometimes regression. Yet, with persistence and self-belief, individuals can successfully navigate their path towards self-actualization.\",\"paper_title\":\"Human-Centred Learning Analytics and AI in Education: a Systematic Literature Review\",\"paper_url\":\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12751v1\",\"reason\":\"to verify the accuracy and relevance of the reference regarding personal development and self-actualization related to Human-Centred Learning Analytics and AI in Education.\"}\n",

      "\n",
      "With the growing number of AI systems being deployed in safety-critical applications, there is a pressing need to establish regulations that govern the safe and responsible use of AI. In December 2023, the EU AI Act (Act) was provisionally agreed upon by the European Parliament, setting the precedent for the regulation of AI applications. It is the first comprehensive regulatory framework governing the development, deployment, and use of AI systems. The Act introduces a risk-based clas-\n",
      "\n",
      "sification of AI products. Applications whose risk is deemed “Unacceptable”, such as social-scoring systems, are banned within the framework of the Act. Applications with a risk rated “High” (high-risk) must demonstrate compliance with stringent requirements ensuring that, among others, safety, transparency, and human rights needs are met. The outlined requirements affect not only AI products, but any stakeholders involved in the AI value chain. Organizations will need to adapt to the evolving\n",
      "\n",
      "landscape of the Act, balancing inno- vation and regulatory adherence. While entities across the AI value chain will need to align with the framework of the Act, future standards and regulations will also be affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety-critical systems, whose failure could result in signifi- cant harm to people or even loss of life, fit under the definition of high risk as defined by the Act. Existing domain-specific\n",
      "\n",
      "safety standards, such as ISO 26262 [1] for automotive or ARP 4761 [2], DO-178C [3], and DO-254 [4] for aerospace, cover some aspects of the Act requirements for high-risk AI systems. However, these standards do not, in their current state, address AI specific considerations for safety, transparency, and human oversight. Although efforts are being made to develop new safety standards for AI systems, their development and adherence are a time-intensive process. Quality models for AI products,\n",
      "\n",
      "such as ISO/IEC 25059:2023 [5], can help address the requirements set out in the Act early in the development cycle. Additionally, they provide the flexibility to include the attributes that may not be safety relevant, but ensure better quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the effect on the AI regulatory landscape, the Act introduces additional challenges to compliance when several stakeholders are involved. Safety-critical AI products are typically part of complex global supply chains, where many suppliers interact to produce the final product. In the automotive industry, for example, it is uncommon for a single entity to be responsible for the development and integration of all vehicle components. In such scenarios, demonstrating compliance to the\n",

Specifically, a systematic methodology that aids organizations in verifying compliance is required. To facilitate this, our work leverages product quality models to break down the Act requirements into verifiable properties. In the first phase, an extended quality model for AI systems is derived using attributes that\n",

      "are relevant to the Act. Next, using this quality model, an approach to map the articles of the Act to quality attributes for AI Systems is presented.

      "There is currently little work surrounding how the require- ments laid out for high-risk AI systems should be addressed. Many organizations seek to understand whether compliance with current regulations can assist in addressing the EU AI Act. Existing standards do not fully cover the stringent require- ments laid out in the Act, such as transparency, lawfulness, and fairness. Product quality models may help fill this gap, and can be more easily adapted to include properties that may not be\n",
      "\n",
      "safety relevant but which do contribute to quality. Existing quality standards, such as ISO/IEC 25010 Product Quality Standard [6] and ISO/IEC FCD 25012 Data Quality Model [7] do not address AI specific attributes such as transparency, controllability, and intervenability. The Quality Model for AI Products/Systems in ISO 25059:2023 [5] introduces some AI specific attributes like functional adaptability, and robustness, however, it is still lacking in its coverage of attributes like transparency,\n",
      "\n",
      "monitorability, and data quality, among others. ISO/IEC 24028 - overview of trustworthiness in artificial intelligence highlights the need for new standards which incorporate AI specific quality attributes [8]. Given this, recent contributions have addressed the need for extended quality models for AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors of [9] define a systematic process for deriving a quality model for ML systems. They formalize the derivation of quality attributes using a quality meta-model, enabling the modelling of different hierarchies of quality. From this meta-model, relevant entities are defined and categorized into corresponding views of an ML product, namely the model, data, infrastructure, environment, and system views. Relevant properties are then described for a selected use case, and a list of\n",
      "\n",
      "corresponding metrics is proposed. This systematic approach ensures a comprehensive coverage of ML-related quality properties, however, it may not be well suited for addressing the Act. Given the high-level nature of the Act, it is beneficial to address high-level properties of AI prod- ucts, which may apply to several levels of abstraction and stakeholder perspectives. In addition, alignment with existing standards is relevant for organizations wishing to understand their current coverage in\n",
      "\n",
      "their development practices. As such, the extended quality model proposed in this paper is based on an alignment to high-level product quality standards, and other existing safety standards.\n",

      "Aside from quality models, recent literature has emerged proposing different approaches for addressing the Act. Novelli et al. [10] highlight the importance of accurately assessing the risk of AI systems in the context of the Act. The authors introduce a risk-assessment model to improve the accuracy of this risk estimation for ethical and safe AI practices in accordance with the Act. While relevant to addressing the\n",
      "\n",
      "Act, this work focuses only on the risk classification and does not delve into the requirements for AI systems that are deemed high risk. A different perspective is taken in [11], which provides an overview of explainability requirements in the Act, proposing metrics for assessing AI Act compliance. The authors highlight the need for metrics that are risk- focused, model-agnostic, goal-aware, intelligible, and acces- sible, and assess current metrics against these criteria. The paper provides a\n",
      "\n",
      "thorough coverage of explainability, but does not address the broader spectrum of requirements outlined in the EU AI Act. It also lacks a comprehensive methodology for addressing these requirements from the perspective of different stakeholders, leaving a gap in practical guidance for entities seeking compliance. A more pragmatic approach to compliance is suggested in [12], where the authors propose a methodology for organizations to measure their compliance to the Act using a comprehensive\n",

      "the query asks for something unsafe; if it does, Claude won’t respond. Example rules include not responding to threaten- ing statements, reducing gender-specific responses to ques- tions, refraining from offering financial advice, etc. Simi- larly, DeepMind’s Sparrow seeks to ensure safety by adher- ing to a loosely defined set of 23 rules (Sparrow 2023). How- ever, neither model possesses a definitive method for safety- enabled learning or, more specifically, inherent safety.\n",

      "Subsequently, the development of InstructGPT occurred, enabling fine-tuning through a few instruction-like prompt- ing methods. Nevertheless, it has been observed that In- structGPT exhibits vulnerability to inconsistent and unsafe behavior even when prompted (Solaiman et al. 2023).\n",

This illustration highlights the fragility of GPT 3.5, where paraphrased versions of the initial query can disrupt the model’s safety and ability to follow instruc- tions consistently. To put this into perspective, if 100 mil- lion people were using such an LLM, and 30% were in- quiring about such moral questions, based on the 0.3 error probability (from Figure 3),\n",

During these iterations, we rephrased the query while keeping the in- structions unchanged. Our evaluation focused on assessing the LLMs’ performance in two aspects: safety (measured through the averaged BART sentiment score (Yin, Hay, and Roth 2019)) and consistency (evaluated by comparing the provided Rule of Thumb (RoTtruth)\n",

However, even in the case of the significant LLMs, the projected similarity score remains below 0.5.

In this case, the evaluator can rec- ognize that the user’s difficulty concentrating during re- laxation may indicate an underlying sleep-related issue. Considering this possibility, the language model can pro- vide more targeted and informed advice. For instance, the evaluator might suggest asking fur- ther questions like: (a) Do you have trouble sleeping at\n",

      "1 INTRODUCTION Generative Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a fast-evolving subfield of Machine Learning (ML) that focuses on models that generate open ended content, such as text [57], code [29], images [1, 2, 56], videos [65], and even music [70]. This technology has already started impacting many industries including education, entertainment, politics, and healthcare. However, as with any dual- use technology, there are significant ethical and safety concerns surrounding its use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Centralized regulations have a few other shortcomings. Regu- lations are often not technically specific [47], with the vagueness then creating non-uniform interpretations across industry players. Hidden expenses in the form of legal and technical compliance teams [22] can skew the competition unfairly towards incumbent companies, since small companies might not have the resources to properly navigate technical compliance. In the U.S., regulation moves at a glacial pace due to the nature of the\n",
      "\n",
      "democratic process with copious stakeholder input. By the time a law has passed, how- ever, technology has often moved forward, with regulators playing catch up [69].\n",
      "\n",
      "In the vacuum created by slow moving regulation, there is a growing community of researchers and developers who build tools and mechanisms for people to protect themselves from the harms of\n",
      "\n",
      "While the ability to create human-like content can be a pow- erful tool for creative expression, with proponents claiming that it democratizes creativity [79], it also raises concerns about the\n",

      "1https://gdpr-info.eu/\n",
      "\n",
      "generative AI. For example, tools such as glaze [68] (to protect art- work from being trained on), to erasure [27] (to erase concepts from stable diffusion models), to Large Language Model (LLM) water- marking [42] (to detect whether a piece of text was generated by an LLM). These tools are distributed and can therefore be used by indi- viduals to protect themselves. But this raises the question: can open source tools that aid in decentralized protection of stakeholders— or rather, subjects of\n",
      "\n",
      "AI harms—also aid in regulatory efforts? Is the more pragmatic solution a combination of both top-down and bottom-up approaches to fight AI harm?\n",
      "\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a middle ground – a framework that we call Dual Governance. This framework outlines a cooperative synergy between centralized regulations and crowdsourced safety mechanisms to protect stakeholders from the harms of generative AI in the U.S. It includes centralized regulatory efforts via U.S. fed- eral agencies such as the FTC and NIST who set broad ethical and safety standards for generative AI, as well as a crowdsourced safety ecosystem comprised of of developers,\n",
      "\n",
      "researchers, and other stake- holders to audit generative AI models and develop tools that provide protections at the individual level. By striking this balance, we posit that the Dual Governance framework can promote innovation and creativity, ensure that generative AI is developed and deployed in a responsible and ethical manner, and protect stakeholders as technology evolves.\n",

      "2 BACKGROUND 2.1 Harms of Generative AI\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1: A protester holding up a sign referencing ChatGPT at the 2023 WGA Strike2\n",
      "\n",
      "Ghosh, et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "While certainly a powerful new paradigm in the ML landscape, Generative AI models bring with them pressing societal harms, that we discuss below.\n",
      "\n",
      "One significant concern is the potential for Generative AI to spread misinformation. Because these algorithms can generate realistic-looking content, including text, images, and videos, they could be used to create fake news stories, social media posts, and even deepfakes. In recent news, the tool MidJourney AI [1] was used to generate fake images of President Donald Trump being arrested in New York, or Pope Francis in a puffer jacket, prompting the Pope to urge people to use AI ethically [53].\n",
      "\n",
      "Misuse of these technologies to spread false information has serious potential implications for the public’s trust in information and could contribute to political instability or social unrest. Text generation models especially are particularly dangerous as they can seamlessly generate text that appears to be factual in context when they aren’t [5], thereby ex- posing a naive user to potentially dangerous outcomes when used in high stakes use cases like healthcare [71], or news reporting [66].\n",
      "\n",
      "Another concern is copyright abuse. For example, someone could use a Generative AI algorithm to create a piece of music or artwork that is very similar to an existing work, potentially leading to copy- right infringement. This could has serious implications for artists and creators who rely on copyright protection to make a living. Furthermore, AI generated pieces of text and art in the style of living artists effectively takes their livelihood away from them, and further diminishes the\n",
      "\n",
      "incentives that artists and writers have in learning skills and creating new content [28]. The threat of remov- ing the human ingenuity component from content creation, and therefore livelihoods, has led to landmark lawsuits such as the ones by artists against Stability AI and Midjourney [7], and community protests, like the Writer’s Guild of America Strike [73].\n",
      "\n",
      "Intertwined with copyright abuse are privacy and consent issues. Generative AI models are trained with text and images indiscrimi- nately crawled from the internet, with little regards to whether it is personal information, copyrighted work, or harmful content [6, 28]. This data can then be used for truly malicious outcomes like gener- ating deepfakes, or new content in the style of a particular person without their consent. Models have also been repeatedly shown to often memorize verbatim and\n",
      "\n",
      "easily regurgitate information in training data, sometimes private data like credit card information or addresses [8, 9], and have also been shown to be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks [31].\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, there is a potential for Generative AI to reinforce existing biases and inequalities. Studies have shown that biases exist in the outputs of both text generation models [83] and image generation models [51]. As more and more synthetically generated content is released into the world and on the internet, biased content has a worryingly large capacity to spread racist, sexist, ableist, or other kinds of socially inappropriate content at a scale that publishers or moderators currently have\n",
      "\n",
      "no capacity to deal with [36].\n",

      "China: China has created specific regulations for recommenda- tion algorithms that include mandatorily registering recommenda- tion algorithms with the internet regulator and submitting them to the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) for a security assessment [46]. For generative AI, the CAC released a draft of rules that focus on content moderation and misinformation that also mandate a security assessment by the CAC’s providers before launch. However, there are some rules in this draft\n",

What this policy means by “true” will need a lot of clarification, and methods to test and metrics to validate this will also need to be defined by regulators or authorized third parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proposed policy papers: There are a number of policy papers in the literature offering critiques, disagreements and proposals. They range from articles arguing that quick regulation amidst what is described as a “tech panic” would do more harm than good [30], to papers that propose requirements in addition to what is specified by the EU specifically for general purpose AI including transparency\n",
      "\n",

Another article [41] proposes in- corporating recourse for users so that individual rights are not ignored, and creating an “FDA for algorithms” so that only licensed algorithms are in use, the latter of\n",
      "\n",
      "which is similar to China’s CAC proposal. Finally, in this [43] article by Grandeur et al., a bottom-up approach is suggested as a method of regulation of AI, with the focus being on self-regulation by consumers, developers, academia, and companies, and minimal, supplemental regulation of AI by a separate government agency. This includes collective agreement on a set of values, transparency, and respecting implicit guidelines set in the industry. We submit that while this is an ideal scenario,\n",
      "\n",

      "Tools and Risk Frameworks: To supplement regulation, risk assessment frameworks and tools have become an effective method at identifying and mitigating AI risk. Various academic scholars, companies, and independent organizations have proposed meth- ods to assess harms at various stages of a model’s life cycle, some even by drawing upon existing processes in different industries. For example, Rismani et. al. [61] explore the adaptation of System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), a safety\n",

      "In building an integrated framework, we would like to focus on a few key objectives. Firstly, through applying this framework, generative AI should not cause the harms described in 2.1. Secondly, we want to build an evolving framework that is mindful of the technical feasibility of the compliance requirements. Thirdly, we do not want to hinder innovation or competition among companies of all sizes. Finally, we want the framework to provide access to communities at large without violating\n",

This is important in making the framework accessible to and easy-to-use for consumers of varying backgrounds.\n",

      "6.1 Overview Our proposed dual governance mechanism seeks to combines both top-down, centralized government regulation and bottom-up, de- centralized community safety efforts – by creating a regulatory framework that sets minimum standards for AI systems and re- quires compliance with those standards, while also providing op- portunities for stakeholders such as users and experts to contribute to the ongoing assessment methodologies and improve AI systems. In doing so, this framework balances\n",
      "\n",
      "the benefits of centralized reg- ulation with the advantages of crowdsourced safety mechanisms. At a high level, the framework would involve an existing federal regulatory body (or a collaboration between agencies), that would establish guidelines and standards for the development and use of AI systems. We do not explicitly propose the creation of a new regulatory body, as policy and legal experts have shown that there are ways for existing agencies and patchwork of regulatory bodies to be\n",
      "\n",
      "flexible enough to govern AI [60]. We also have a potential good example in the united approach introduced by the U.S. federal agencies in 4 combining regulatory bodies to govern AI. Guidelines issued by the agency or collective would set minimum standards to limit the harms and propagate the values we discuss in 3. Com- panies and organizations would be required to comply with these guidelines, and the centralized agency or collective would have the power to enforce compliance through\n",
      "\n",
      "inspections, fines, and other measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to centralized regulation, the framework would also incorporate crowdsourced safety mechanisms, which would involve stakeholders in the ongoing assessment and improvement of AI systems, with the aim of making compliance easier. This could take several forms, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Public feedback, town halls, and reporting: The gov- ernment mandates companies as well as agencies to pro- vide a mechanism for users to report issues and provide feedback on AI systems. Town halls are also conducted to gather direct feedback and suggestions from consumers. This feedback could be used to identify issues and areas for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing alternatives: Government agencies provide a way for consumers to take action when they believe they have been subject to incorrect or unfair decisions from AI systems. This could range from defining processes for requesting the decision to be reviewed by humans, to filing lawsuits in situations of significant damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expert review: Federal agencies engage experts in the field to review AI systems and provide feedback on their safety and efficacy. This could include academics, industry experts, and other stakeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community audits and research: Community auditors review AI systems and provide feedback on their biases, safety and efficacy via hackathons and bounties. Parallely, the research community publishes defense mechanisms for decentralized protections. The federal agencies continue to assess the outcomes of these community efforts and issue up to date best practices, effectively informing future regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the dual governance mechanism would aim to strike a balance between centralized regulation and crowdsourced safety mechanisms, with the regulatory body setting minimum standards and enforcing compliance, while stakeholders provide ongoing feedback to improve the safety and efficacy of AI systems. We discuss these two aspects in further detail in 6.2 and 6.3.\n",

Simply creating regulations for generative AI systems could lead to lending legitimacy to potentially dangerous tech- nology that could spread misinformation or use people’s data in malicious ways.

Champions of open-source methodologies can not only implement tools that satisfy central regulations, but also technically implement and shape regulations by voicing opinions and sharing solutions.

We define the steps that the evaluation process should contain:\n",

      "\n",

This could take many forms, such as directing an agency like NIST to go through and certify new mechanisms every six months. The agencies could also be given authority to decide when a new mechanism needs full congressional approval. • How are mechanisms certified? Creating a transparent set of requirements and tests to verify these mechanisms. The requirements should include testing the mechanisms for\n",

The agencies could also rely on consumer reports of how the tool works, provided evidence is shared to support their claims. Over time, a test methodology could be developed that runs a number of tests on the proposed tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ghosh, et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does certification work? Authorizing or certifying the tool and adding it to a registry. Having a centralized place where stakeholders can access tools that have been validated by these agencies would allow them to be widely used and tested against different contexts. There should also be a time limit after which this certification expires, to ensure that the tools are up-to-date with the latest stan- dards.\n",

In the U.S., passing a law requires consensus from the House, the Senate and the President, and depending on the political scenario and the policy priorities of the nation, getting new regulations passed can potentially take years.

      "6.4 Satisfying the prescribed criteria The Dual Governance framework aims to bring clarity to exist- ing regulations by associating them with technical interventions.

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "The current mainstream of autonomous vehicle (AV) software pipeline consists of key modules: perception (Feng et al., 2020; Man et al., 2023), prediction (Nayakanti et al., 2023; Jiao et al., 2022), planning(Liu et al., 2023b), and control. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become integral to perception and prediction, with a growing interest in planning and control. However, the black- box nature of DNNs, along with their inherent uncertainties from learning algorithms, presents challenges in\n",
      "\n",
      "ensuring the safety of closed-loop AV systems. These challenges are exacerbated by the generalizability issue of DNNs and the prevalence of long-tail driving scenarios not covered during training and design time (Jiao et al., 2023b; Fu et al., 2024; Ding et al., 2023a; Jiao et al., 2023a).\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, researchers and engineers in the AV industry are exploring the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2020; Devlin et al., 2018) for their ability for human interaction, adept reasoning capabilities, and comprehensive knowledge, particularly in handling long-tail driving scenarios (Yang et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2024). Nevertheless, the practical integration of LLMs into the AV software pipeline for safety purposes remains an open question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, this paper delves into the application of LLMs in autonomous driving from a safety perspective, highlighting its implementation through a couple of illuminating case studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a safety perspective, figure 1 shows the possible integration of LLMs for different modules in the AV software pipeline. As a safety-critical system, we equip the AV with a safety verifier for the proposed control input generated from the software stack with assistance from LLMs. The verifier returns safety-checking results to LLM for in-context safety learning which could affect the outputs from different components in various ways. In this paper, we conduct two case studies to leverage\n",

      "LLM as a behavior-level decision-maker which interacts with a high-level predictor for evaluating the intention and aggressiveness of other agents, and with the low-level trajectory planner and safety verifier. These case studies show that LLM can improve system performance while achieving safety assurance. We hope this paper can provide the AV community with a comprehensive safety standpoint to explore and evaluate the usage of LLM in their AV software stack.\n",

Most directly, LLM can make behavior-level decisions such as lane changing by scene understanding via text, which affects the trajectory planning with different safety constraints, as shown in our case studies.

Besides, LLM can assist the perception module in understanding the scene for decision-making better.

      "The integration of LLMs such as GPT-3 (OpenAI, 2020) into AD has garnered significant attention in recent years, revolutionizing natural language understanding and enhancing the capabilities of self-driving vehicles (Wayve, 2023). The related literature from different perspectives is as follows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human-Oriented: One direct application is enabling human-vehicle interaction through natural language. LLMs have been leveraged to interpret, respond, and provide suggestions in natural language to human riders and drivers (Zhang et al., 2023; Wayve, 2023; Xu et al., 2023). These models generate natural language narrations that assist human driving for decision-making and improve the interpretability of AD systems by explaining driving behaviors. Recent works have gone beyond interaction and\n",
      "\n",
      "employed LLMs to learn human driving behaviors and trajectory data through chain-of-thoughts (Wei et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2023b). This approach enables the LLM driver to behave like humans to solve complex driving scenarios and even allows LLMs to function directly as motion planners (Mao et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Perception, Prediction, and Planning (Decision-making): The reasoning, interpretation, memoriza- tion, and decision-making abilities of LLMs contribute to solving long-tail corner cases, improving generalizability, and increasing the interpretability of AD systems. Specifically, there is a grow- ing interest in integrating LLMs into the planning (decision-making) module, which significantly improves user trust and generalizes to various driving cases (Jin et al., 2023a). This integration is\n",
      "\n",
      "achieved through fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs (Liu et al., 2023a) or by prompt engineering with chain-of-thought, which usually enable the AD motion planner to process multilabel inputs, e.g., ego-vehicle information, maps, and perception results (Wen et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2024; Mao et al., 2023). Additionally, researchers are exploring LLMs in the perception module to\n",

Zhou et al summarize the state-of-the-art works in this field (Zhou et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the aforementioned references fail to address safety concerns associated with LLM in AD. We prioritize safety under the context of LLM, a perspective evident in our case studies. We allow LLM decisions to directly formulate safety constraints for low-level Model Predictive Control (MPC) under prediction uncertainties. Our case studies align closely with the LanguageMPC (Sha et al., 2023), where the authors also employ LLMs as a decision-maker for AD. They convert LLM decisions into\n",
      "\n",
      "the mathematical representations needed for the low-level controllers, MPC, through guided parameter matrix adaptation. However, LanguageMPC has not been extensively validated in complex driving environments. Additionally, it does not consider uncertainty from predictions nor include safety analysis or optimization in its methodology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generation and Simulation: LLMs’ generative capabilities have facilitated the acquisition of complex driving data samples, which were previously difficult to gather due to certain environmental constraints. The diffusion model, a method that has recently reached significant success in the text-to-image domain, has become increasingly popular (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020).

      "Our work is related to the safety verification for ML-based autonomous systems where AD systems are representative. Safety verification, in general, can be categorized into two groups: 1) explicit reachable set computation (Wang et al., 2023d; Huang et al., 2022; Ivanov et al., 2021; Kochdumper et al., 2023; Goubault & Putot, 2022; Schilling et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2019) and 2) inexplicit reachable set evaluation, such as barrier certificate (Prajna, 2006; Wang et al., 2023b), control\n",

      "The \"TEXT\" provides a summary that is consistent with the details presented in the \"PAPER_CONTENT\". It accurately describes the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving systems, specifically for decision-making in driving scenarios, complemented with a safety verifier shield for in-context safety learning. The description of LLM utilization for robust decision-making and the paper's focus on safety aspects are confirmed through the detailed explanation provided in the \"PAPER_CONTENT\".\n",

      "Summary of Empowering Autonomous Driving with Large Language Models: A Safety Perspective [http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00812v4]:\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper presents an approach to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, focusing on enhancing safety and handling unforeseen driving scenarios. The authors, Yixuan Wang and colleagues, explore the use of LLMs due to their potent common-sense knowledge and reasoning capabilities, which can improve the performance and generalization issues present in deep neural networks traditionally used in AD systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed method uses LLMs as intelligent decision-makers in behavioral planning, coupled with a safety verifier shield for in-context safety learning to enhance driving performance while ensuring safety. The paper details two key studies using a simulated environment: one involving an adaptive LLM-conditioned Model Predictive Control (MPC), and the other featuring an LLM-enabled interactive behavior planning with a state machine. The studies demonstrate superior performance and safety compared to current approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper discusses the challenges in deploying AD systems, particularly those associated with DNNs, such as the black-box nature and uncertainty from learning algorithms, which can lead to safety concerns in out-of-distribution and uncertain data scenarios. The authors propose using LLMs, which show promise in improving interpretability and handling long-tail driving scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the two case studies presented, the paper showcases how LLMs can impact trajectory planning by providing behavior decisions which MPC can use to formulate safety constraints. Also, the paper discusses in-context safety learning, where a verifier provides feedback to the LLM to enhance the safety of decisions. The latter half of the paper introduces a multi-step planning framework incorporating state machines and intention prediction to guide LLM decision-making that mimics human interactive decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors consider various roles for LLMs in AD, including assisting with perception, prediction, and simulation tasks, thereby potentially improving the system's safety and effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the paper highlights how LLMs can be used in autonomous vehicles to achieve improved safety assurance, pointing toward a future direction for the AD community to explore further the integration of LLMs for safety-critical applications.\n",

      "When navigating the intricate world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two terms often emerge - \"reliability\" and \"safety.\" While at first glance, these terms might seem quite basic; however, in AI, they encompass intricate nuances. Let's unravel what these terms denote in an AI context and understand why they're invaluable for the progression and mass acceptance of AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reliability refers to an AI system's ability to consistently produce expected outputs over different scenarios and periods. For instance, consider the TRSM-RS movie recommender system, based on users' gender and a new weighted similarity measure known as the Tanimoto Reliability Similarity Measure (TRSM). In this system, recommendations provided should consistently align with a user's preferences, regardless of the time of day or day of the week. By using reliability measures, the TRSM-RS recommendation system demonstrates enhanced performance marked by improved mean absolute error rates and increased precision and recall, highlighting increased prediction accuracy[1]('TRSM-RS: A Movie Recommender System Based on Users' Gender and New Weighted Similarity Measure', arxiv.org, Mostafa Khalaji).\n",

      "In contrast, safety in AI deals with the system's potential to cause harm, either through direct actions or via indirect consequences. An AI system is deemed safe if it avoids scenarios causing harm to humans or the environment. Take the example of AI-driven diabetic retinopathy detection. A safe system in this context should identify disease markers without generating false positives, reducing the risk of unnecessary medical interventions or undue psychological distress[2]('Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy in Retinal Fundus Photographs', jamanetwork.com, Gulshan.V et al.).\n",

      "Safety and reliability are intertwined facets of AI systems. An AI system that is unreliable and unpredictable can lead to unsafe outcomes, underscoring the mutual relevance of these constructs.\n",

      "With AI continually evolving, numerous research efforts aim to improve AI reliability and safety. Methodologies like Robust Adversarial Training exemplify this by bolstering an AI system's defenses against manipulative inputs, increasing system reliability[3]('Adversarial Machine Learning', arxiv.org, Biggio.B et al.). Also, the increased focus on AI explainability measures facilitates a better understanding of AI decision-making processes, vital for establishing trust[4]('Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, Taxonomies, Opportunities and Challenges', journals.elsevier.com, M.do Carmo Nicoletti, Leandro N. de Castro). \n",

      "\n",
      "The exponential growth of artificial intelligence invites an intertwined advancement of technology with ethics and regulation. For instance, Large Language Models (LLMs), while pushing the frontiers in fields like bioinformatics, necessitate a robust framework for safety and reliability to mitigate potential risks when employed in sensitive environments like healthcare (Raji & Dobbe, 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The ethical implications of AI's deployment underline the need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks. The European Union's AI Act mandates a risk-based classification of AI systems with an emphasis on high-risk applications, laying the groundwork for adherence to safety, transparency, and trustworthiness in AI products. The Act serves as a benchmark for methodological compliance, particularly for safety-critical AI systems, and highlights the need for continuous improvement and measurable metrics to evaluate AI systems (Kelly et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Complementing regulatory efforts, the paradigm of Dual Governance emerges as a potential solution to the myriad ethical and safety concerns related to generative AI. This framework advocates a harmonious blend of centralized government regulations and community-developed safety mechanisms, presenting an innovative approach to fostering a responsible and creative AI ecosystem (Ghosh & Lakshmi, 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The pursuit of understanding and regulating AI is an ongoing process, one that requires multi-dimensional research and international discourse. Establishing regulatory insight and oversight for AI technologies is not an endpoint but a continuous cycle of refinement. By endorsing methodologies that uphold ethical and safety standards, we can shape an AI-integrated future that aligns with societal values and promotes wellbeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the strides in ethical and regulatory frameworks for AI development represent a foundational approach to safeguarding the trajectory of AI innovations. It is this conscientious integration of ethical principles and regulatory practices that will ensure AI continues to serve as a bastion of progress—responsibly and safely.\n",

However, as we continue to deploy these learning-enabled systems in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, health- care, and aerospace,\n",

Within the scope of safe RL, the reﬁnement of poli- cies stands as a crucial strategy, especially in safety-critical applications. Policy\n",

      "reﬁnement is an iterative process that focuses on enhancing an agent’s policy to ensure it exhibits both safe and optimal behavior while conforming to envi- ronmental constraints and task speciﬁcations. It entails the evaluation of an agent’s present policy, the identiﬁcation of unsafe or suboptimal actions, and the subsequent update of the policy to mitigate these deﬁciencies. Thus, policy reﬁne- ment not only ensures the safety of the RL system during both learning and deployment phases but\n",

      "Two techniques, counterexample-guided abstraction re- ﬁnement (CEGAR) and counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS), have gained traction due to their robust approach to system reﬁnement. CEGAR, originally con- ceived for the formal veriﬁcation of ﬁnite-state systems, op- erates by iteratively reﬁning an abstract system model based on counterexamples unearthed during veriﬁcation (Clarke et al. 2000). While CEGAR hasn’t been widely used in RL, its principles of abstract representation and\n",

Sim- ilarly, CEGIS is a methodology centered on the synthesis of a correct-by-construction program or policy satisfying a given speciﬁcation (Solar-Lezama et al. 2006). It starts with an initial candidate policy or program, which is then reﬁned based on counterexamples encountered during the veriﬁca- tion phase. CEGIS has shown its effectiveness in various domains such\n",

      "\n",
      "Both CEGAR and CEGIS underscore the potential role of counterexamples in reﬁning a policy, opening up new av- enues for exploration in RL. By integrating the principles of these techniques with safe RL strategies, there is poten- tial to create a more efﬁcient policy reﬁnement process, con-\n",

      "This work aims to lay the foundation for data-driven pol- icy reﬁnement in reinforcement learning. Our primary goal is to bridge the gap between data-driven veriﬁcation and rein- forcement learning, offering an iterative approach that syn- ergizes the strengths of both domains. In our proposed ap- proach, we propose a data-driven veriﬁcation method that identiﬁes unsafe trajectories in the current policy. This ver- iﬁcation stage acts as a performance check, ensuring that the policy meets the\n",

In essence, the veri- ﬁcation stage drives the learning process, providing direct, actionable feedback on the policy’s performance. Follow- ing the data-driven veriﬁcation, we use a learning approach that speciﬁcally targets the identiﬁed counterexamples. This learning stage takes the counterexamples as\n",
