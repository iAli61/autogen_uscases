      "MEMORIZE: The excerpt from 'The Digital Divide in Process Safety: Quantitative Risk Analysis of Human-AI Collaboration' discusses the historical context of human error in risk analysis, particularly noting that human error did not gain significant attention until after the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident in 1979. In a precursor to this heightened awareness, the WASH-1400 Reactor Safety Study conducted by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1975 had already included the consideration of operator action errors in their event tree analysis (ETA). This study is acknowledged as a milestone in the field of quantitative risk analysis (QRA), incorporating attempts to use human error rates.

The factors affecting this safety include Workplace Location Accessibility, Workplace Visibility, Noise at the Workplace, Communication Pathways, Resistances, System Transparency, Human-System Interface, Equipment and Tools, Staffing, Training, Work Processes, Information Availability, and Multi-Tasking among others. Also noted are the risk analysis methods from SLIM (1984) to IDHEAS (2017) and tools like LOPA and CREAM. Significant emphasis is placed on understanding and addressing human error, which gained attention post the Three Mile Island nuclear accident (1979). There is a strong focus on the role of AI and humans in process safety, the uncertainties in AI failure and human error rates, and how the risks in human-AI collaboration can be quantified.

      "\n",
      "The article titled 'The Digital Divide in Process Safety: Quantitative Risk Analysis of Human-AI Collaboration' studies the quantitative risk analysis of human-AI collaboration, which involves human error and AI failure based on data analysis. It applies LOPA (Layer of Protection Analysis) to evaluate the human-AI collaboration and discusses Instrumented Systems (SIS), Basic Process Control Systems (BPCS), and emergency shutdowns as applications of AI. Additionally, it highlights the change in AI reliability research from the component level to the system application level, stating that SIS requires higher reliability than BPCS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The research methods include a comprehensive qualitative risk analysis to identify challenges and gaps in human-AI collaboration and Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) which uses LOPA and BN to specify and assess risk in this collaboration. The probabilities of human error and AI failure are accessed from LOPA practices, IDHEAS, and industry application practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other relevant elements discussed in this research include various standards such as ISO/IEC TR 24029-1:2021, TR 24028:2020, TR 29119-11: 2020, and tools like the cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM), and the advanced HRA method IDHEAS-Data. It also discusses data uncertainty in the probabilities of AI failure and human error, the quantification of risk in human-AI collaboration, and the creation of a model to depict the collaboration between humans and AI.\n",

      "- Benchmarking in different contexts underscores the effect of data uncertainty in AI failure rate and Human Error Probability (HEP) on accident likelihood.\n",
      "- The key finding is that humans, though being the most critical, are also the most unpredictable, unreliable, and vulnerable part of the human-AI system.\n",
      "- It's crucial to avoid the trap of continuously improving the automation capability and digitalization level while neglecting human error.\n",
      "- The similarity in both scenarios is that near miss makes up the largest portion of unsafe conditions (near miss, mishap, incident, accident). This suggests the necessity to preempt unwanted outcomes as early as possible.\n",
      "- Increasing the reliability of Basic Process Control System (BPCS) and the operator's practical action is vital to system safety.\n",
      "- AI-human collaboration refers to the fact that any deviation in the control system (an undesired but tolerable deviation) is an initial event that exists at all times.\n",
      "- The undesired but tolerable consequences are near miss (BPCS failure), mishap (Safety Instrumented System initiation), and incident (manual shutdown success).\n",
      "- The accident is the failure to manually shut down.\n",
      "- AI plays a role equivalent to humans in preventing an undesired event.\n",
      "- Increasing human actions can have counter effects as human action is tied to each AI failure.\n",
      "- Consideration of human error began in the mid-1940s, with significant focus following the Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear power plant accident in 1979.\n",
      "- A approach to handle the data uncertainty in the likelihoods of AI failures and human error is quantifying the risk in human-AI collaboration.\n",
      "- AI failures are categorized as systematic, sensor, logic solver, and actuator failures.\n",
      "- Systematic failures include system integration, network communication, power supply outage, and I/O (input/output) connection failure.\n",
      "- The AI model might be biased from the start due to potentially uncertain, imperfect, inherently biased sensor data, which could also be dirty with improper feedback and miscellaneous information.\n",

      "- It highlights the prevalence of near-miss incidents in unsafe conditions and points out the importance of improving both the reliability of Basic Process Control Systems (BPCS) and operator actions.\n",
      "- Key human error probabilities in various contexts, such as environment noise, heat, system transparency, etc., are listed in Table 8.\n",
      "- A critical finding is that the human element remains the most unpredictable component in human-AI systems, emphasizing the risk of focusing solely on automation and digitalization while neglecting human error.\n",
      "- The need for a quantitative analysis focused on human-AI collaboration, encompassing both AI failure and human error, is also identified.\n",
      "- BN (Bayesian Network) is mentioned as a tool applied to enhance the QRA (Quantitative Risk Analysis) of human-AI systems, and specific AI failures such as systematic, sensor, logic solver, and actuator failures are detailed.\n",

      "- The study identified the types of AI in process safety, the differences between humans and AI, and how they collaborate.\n",
      "- The inadequate research on the impact of digitalization on process safety was addressed.\n",
      "- The challenges and gaps were analyzed through qualitative thinking.\n",
      "- Human error is the most critical yet unpredictable, unreliable, and vulnerable part in human-AI system. Hence, attention must be given to this aspect amid the continuous improvement of automation capability and digitalization level.\n",
      "- The study also touched upon process operations warning of possible deviating conditions in the environment.\n",
      "- Observing human error became significant after the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident in 1979. The WASH-1400 Reactor Safety Study by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1975 is considered a milestone in quantitative risk analysis.\n",
      "- The study took into account various failures such as integration failure, network communication failure, power supply failure, I/O connection failure, model uncertainty, control logic unit (CLU) failure, and insufficient storage.\n",

      "**Ensuring Trust in Our Digital Confidants: The Importance of Reliability and Safety in Large Language Models**\n",
      "\n",
      "In a world where technology is rapidly advancing, artificial intelligence (AI) has become not just a tool but a companion, curator, and advisor. Large language models (LLMs) are at the forefront of this evolution, powering everything from simple chatbots to sophisticated virtual assistants. However, as their influence grows, so does the concern about their reliability and safety. How can we trust these digital entities? Let’s unfold the layers of AI's reliability and safety mechanisms to answer this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "*The Quest for Reliability*\n",
      "\n",
      "Reliability in AI isn't merely about whether the AI is available 24/7 or if it can handle a large volume of questions. It's about consistency over time, accuracy of information, and the ability to perform safely under different circumstances. Recent research has extensively explored new ways to model the reliability of LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "One clear trend is the emphasis on continuous testing and validation. Just like cars undergo crash tests to ensure safety, LLMs are subjected to various stress tests that simulate extreme situations or expose them to misleading inputs. This helps in identifying potential weaknesses in the AI's understanding and response capabilities. Furthermore, advancements in self-monitoring AI systems are now enabling these models to assess their reliability in real-time, flagging content that doesn't meet quality standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Safety Mechanisms: The AI Guardrails*\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of safety in AI is multidimensional – ranging from preventing offensive or harmful outputs to ensuring the AI respects privacy and security. Leading papers emphasize the integration of safety mechanisms as early as the design phase of LLM development.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, some LLMs are equipped with fail-safes that can detect when the AI is venturing into topics it's not confident about or should avoid. These mechanisms can prompt the model to seek assistance or handover the interaction to a human moderator. Moreover, techniques such as differential privacy are becoming standard to protect user data and ensure that the AI's training process does not compromise individual privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Ethical AI: A Cornerstone of Public Trust*\n",
      "\n",
      "As AI models become more deeply embedded in our lives, their alignment with societal values and ethical norms is crucial. This includes the mitigation of biases that may be present in the data the AI learns from and ensuring these models do not propagate stereotypes or prejudice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Novel methodologies in the development of ethical frameworks for LLMs are garnering attention. These frameworks guide the training and operation of AI, building in a layer of ethical reasoning that helps AI navigate complex moral landscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Staying Ahead: Latest Research and Best Practices*\n",
      "\n",
      "The field of AI safety and reliability is ever-evolving, responding to both technological advances and public concern. Best practices now involve multi-stakeholder consultations, including input from ethicists, psychologists, and end-users, to create well-rounded LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emerging research has also highlighted the importance of transparency in AI operations. Transparent safety protocols not only instill confidence in users but also facilitate a better understanding of AI decisions, thereby enabling more controlled and reliable outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Parting Thoughts*\n",
      "\n",
      "Our journey with AI, particularly with large language models, is still in its early days. By focusing on reliability and safety, we not only improve the user experience but also lay the groundwork for responsible AI applications that earn our trust and serve the greater good. The continuous research and rigorous implementation of robust safety and reliability models are essential for maintaining this delicate balance between innovation and caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "This blog post has briefly touched upon the complex yet fascinating domain of AI reliability and safety. For those interested in delving deeper, I encourage exploring the rich array of recent literature available on platforms like arXiv. It's by understanding and contributing to these discussions that we can ensure AI continues to develop as a force for positive change, while safeguarding the values and well-being of society.\n",

      "Imagine you're typing an email and, as if by magic, your computer suggests how to complete your sentences. Or perhaps you're chatting with a virtual assistant, asking for recipes or the weather forecast. These scenarios are powered by what experts call Large Language Models (LLMs)—AI-driven engines that understand and generate human-like text. They’re the invisible helpers embedded in our digital lives, but with their presence comes a pressing question: How can we ensure they're safe and reliable companions?\n",

      "Reliability in AI extends beyond just being right. It's about providing correct, consistent information over time, and doing so in a respectful, safe way. For instance, recent efforts in AI reliability focus on tests that challenge these models with tricky situations—akin to throwing curveballs to see if the AI can still hit a home run with accuracy and grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine AI as a novice chef: it must handle every ingredient (input data) with care and follow the recipe (algorithms) flawlessly. If it misinterprets pepper for sugar, the result could be unpalatable. That's why it's vital for AI to know its limits, like a good chef knows their flavor profiles. For example, self-monitoring AI can now sense when it's out of depth—prompting a call for human help, much like a chef might consult a colleague when unsure.\n",

      "- 'The Alignment Problem in Context' by Raphaël Millière discusses the ongoing challenge in AI development known as the alignment problem, where AI systems must be made safe and reliable by ensuring their behavior is aligned with human values. This issue is significant not only for future AI systems but also for current systems like large language models, which can potentially cause harm and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can trigger unsafe behavior. Effective strategies for alignment remain insufficient, and there are concerns about the safety of future, more advanced AI systems [source: The Alignment Problem in Context, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02147v1].\n",

For example, LLMs may reflect, perpetuate, and amplify harmful stereotypes and unfair biases present in their training data (Abid et al. 2021, Rae et al. 2022, Nadeem et al. 2020); they may produce offensive or toxic language and hate speech,.\n",

Nonetheless, ICL demonstrates that models of a certain size can effectively “learn” on the fly to perform tasks they have not been fine-tuned for, by leveraging information contained in the context of the prompt.

      "1. Large Language Models (LLMs) can sometimes make up facts or \"hallucinate\", due to some inherent tendencies, which has led to their comparison with the notion of a “bullshiter” who produces compelling speech without regard for truth or falsity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. LLMs show capabilities that suggest an aptitude for effective generalization beyond the distribution of their training data, yet they also have various failure modes and lack human-like intelligence aspects. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. The existing and potential risks of LLMs necessitate establishing effective guardrails for safe deployment. This concern is applicable whether the LLMs are openly released or are behind APIs or integrated into consumer products.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. LLMs are trained on a next-token prediction objective - a method often referred to as 'pre-training'. This pre-training can lead to good performance on numerous tasks that the LLMs have not been explicitly optimized for.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. As LLMs become more capable, information hazards are also likely to increase. Larger LLMs trained on larger datasets have been observed to show improved performance, a trend that leads to emergent abilities in larger models.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. To prevent harms from LLMs, the value alignment problem must be addressed by identifying acceptable principles to guide the LLMs' behavior and effective strategies to steer their behavior in line with these guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. LLMs' performance is a contested topic, some view them mere 'stochastic parrots', while others see them as early signs of artificial general intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The possible harm caused by LLMs is widely acknowledged due to their sophistication and difficulty to control. The paper focuses on whether these harms can be mitigated by existing alignment techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. There's a potential threat that future LLMs could produce original insights serving nefarious goals. Some evidence suggests LLMs can be effective at scientific synthesis, inference, and explanation in technical domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Information hazards from LLMs are likely to become more concerning in the future irrespective of whether this technology leads to human-like intelligence.\n",

      " Successful prompt injection attacks “trick” LLMs into generating harmful, toxic, or rule-violating content by providing adversarial instructions that exploit its objectives and training paradigm (also known as “jailbreaking” the model). They can elicit a wide range of unsafe behaviours from LLMs, such as generating toxic text, hate speech, or misinformation, providing dangerous advice, leaking private information, plagiarizing or infringing copyrighted content (Liu, Deng, Xu, Li, Zheng, Zhang,.\n",

      "The passage discusses the alignment problem in the context of AI and refers to the risks associated with misaligned AI systems converging upon goals that are harmful to human interests. It mentions that actual risks come from a broader value alignment problem that applies to any system with sufficient degrees of freedom to be steered towards or away from a set of desired norms. System prompts, or pre-prompts, are one of the strategies to avoid AI misalignment by steering model behavior through instructions that are prepended to user inputs. There is an emphasis on the lack of intrinsic truth preference in base large language models (LLMs), which are optimized for generating text that looks plausible based on the input sequence, which can be problematic when relying on detailed context to distinguish between factual and fictional tasks. The fine-tuning of LLMs becomes critical, involving human feedback on generated responses and reinforcement learning to adjust the LLM's behavior toward responses that align with human preferences.\n",

      "- 'System prompts' are hidden instructions that companies use when offering API access to LLMs (Large Language Models). These are kept hidden to maintain industrial secrets and uphold safety measures. \n",
      "\n",
      "- System prompts could be exposed by creating adversarial inputs, however, this indicates an issue with the current alignment strategies for LLMs. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Alignment strategies include fine-tuning base LLMs and leveraging ICL through prompting strategies, aiming to align the behaviour of LLMs with norms compatible with reliable and safe use.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Fine-tuning and using system prompts are main strategies used to align LLMs’ values with human norms. These prompts guide the model’s behaviour without needing further training or adjustment of the model's internal parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The LLM training process is often called “pre-training”, which does not involve specific fine-tuning for certain tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In a zero-shot setting, LLM struggles without provided examples in the prompt. \n",
      "\n",
      "- LLMs lack inherent preference for truth or falsity. They are trained to generate plausible-looking text, albeit this can cause issues in discerning fact from fiction when the input context is lacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The alignment problem refers not only to AI, but any system that can be aligned with a set of desired norms. Misaligned systems present significant risks if they accidentally pursue goals against human interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Generating multiple LLM responses for each prompt and having human crowdworkers provide comparative feedback for these outputs is one method of fine-tuning. This allows models to better align with human preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In the final stage, reinforcement learning is used to fine-tune the LLM, using the reward model scores as feedback with each response during training. This learning method can be repeated iteratively to progressively improve LLM alignment. \n",
      "\n",
      "- LLM can potentially respond to risky user queries that align with unethical goals. This highlights the importance of ethical guidelines and safety measures in LLM training and operation.\n",

Others nudge the LLM to ignore its alignment-sensitive dispositions by invoking a fictional unrestricted “developer.\n",

      " The key insight from this research is that predictions made by a Transformer model at each timestep during ICL can be seen as the result of mesa-optimization. Specifically, the model constructs an internal training set from the context tokens provided as input. For example, in a simple linear sequence modelling task, the model internally groups tokens from the prompt to create input-target pairs that form a regression problem. This implicitly defines an internal objective function – a loss over.\n",

      "The passage from 'The Alignment Problem in Context' brings up the broad capabilities of language learning models (LLMs) that are achieved through pre-training on extensive text collections, or corpora, and their aptitude for following specific natural language instructions thanks to fine-tuning objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process involved in making LLMs more aligned with human preferences and more capable of understanding and responding accurately involves various stages. One of these is Instruction Following at Inference (ICL), which occurs after the model has been pre-trained through next-token prediction tasks. Once the model’s parameters are set or \"frozen\", they aren't updated unless the model is fine-tuned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine-tuning is often implemented through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), where the model's internal parameters are gradually adjusted using feedback from a reward model. In this setup, higher 'rewards' from the model mean that the responses generated align better with what is desired or preferred by humans. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the use of fine-tuning alone has proved inadequate to fully address the alignment problem. Another strategy deployed is to insert custom instructions into each prompt that is passed to the model. Known as in-context learning, it aligns model behavior without changing LLM's parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, although LLMs exhibit remarkable abilities and a substantial capacity for generalization beyond their training data, they also have significant limitations and frequently fall short of human-level intelligence. These limitations can be due to intrinsic constraints within the current architectures and training objectives. As such, reducing these failures, while enhancing the systems' aptitude for effective generalization, is a critical challenge in AI safety research.\n",

Given that these attacks exploit ICL, and that the effectiveness of ICL is dependent upon the number of tokens available for mesa-optimization of a task-relevant objective, long context windows offer a greater.\n",

      "The article discusses an in-depth understanding of Language Learning Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 - a Transformer-based Deep Neural Network, that learns to generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence of linguistic tokens based on the next-token prediction objective. The internal parameters of these models are fine-tuned using iterative updates to refine its predictions until the loss stabilizes and they achieve a good performance at next-token prediction. \n",
      "\n",
      "The shortcomings of base LLMs relating to the alignment problem which do not receive additional fine-tuning post pre-training have been addressed using strategies like reintroducing fine-tuning after pre-training. This allows the models to adjust their behavior and align better with human preferences. \n",
      "\n",
      "These systems certainly have effective capacities for generalizing beyond their training data distribution but also exhibit significant failures. The failure modes and limitations might be intrinsic to the LLM's current architectures and training objectives. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, these models are capable of performing challenging tasks including arithmetic and multi-step reasoning. Their performance improvement on next-word prediction is typically gradual and predictable; however, behavioral breakthroughs can be sudden and unpredictable. Bigger models can memorize more information from their training data, including domain-specific knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, reinforcement learning plays a vital role in the final stages of fine-tuning, where it maximizes the expected rewards obtained from the reward model and steers the LLMs behaviour towards generating responses that achieve higher estimated rewards. This process is often conducted in iterations to consistently improve LLM alignment.\n",

      "4. Base LLMs do not intrinsically prefer truth or falsity; they generate text based on plausibility rather than factual accuracy.\n",
      "5. The value alignment problem is broad and not limited to AI that poses a direct risk but extends to systems whose free behavior could diverge from desired norms.\n",
      "6. Base LLMs can inadvertently produce toxic outputs due to the nature of the training data.\n",
      "7. There are concerns about LLMs being used maliciously because they are not designed to refuse queries with potentially unethical motives.\n",

      "- There is a significant (>99%) risk of adversarial attacks being successful on held-out tests. These attacks aim to trick language learning models (LLMs) into generating harmful content or violating instructions.\n",
      "- The method of instructional codification at language-level (ICL) may be similar to fine-tuning in that adversarial attacks could also leverage it to undo the benefits of methods like instruction tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and system prompts.\n",
      "- Few-shot prompting with just a few demonstrations of harmful responses to destructive inputs is enough to induce an LLM to respond harmfully to new inputs.\n",
      "- There is a continued vulnerability to prompt-based adversarial attacks regardless of efforts for safety precautions.\n",
      "- Current mitigation methods for these adversarial attacks are not completely effective, pointing to the urgent need for research to prevent them. An exploration into the deep connection between the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and the mechanisms that enable ICL in LLMs could provide some insights.\n",
      "- There is the further risk of responding to dangerous user queries under the guise of plausible text completion, where the given input might motivate unethical goals.\n",
      "- With the final stage of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), an LLM's internal parameters can be adjusted towards responses that achieve higher estimated rewards, thus potentially improving the alignment with human preferences. However, it doesn't eliminate the alignment issue entirely.\n",

      "The key insight from the research about \"The Alignment Problem in Context\" is that predictions made by a Transformer model such as LLM at each timestep during In-Context Learning (ICL) can be seen as the result of mesa-optimization. The model constructs its own internal training set from the context tokens provided as input. In a simple linear sequence modelling task, the model internally groups tokens from the prompt to create input-target pairs that form a regression problem, thereby defining an internal objective function or a loss over. \n",
      "\n",
      "This conclusion is based on a process where initially, the Large Language Model (LLM) adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the error between its prediction about the upcoming token and the actual token during pre-training. In the final stage, the LLM is fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, which uses the reward model scores as feedback for each response generated during the training. This way, LLM's behavior can be adjusted to responses that attain higher estimated rewards, thereby aligning better with human preferences. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, this inference is found to be valid even in challenging tasks like arithmetic and multi-step reasoning. Larger models possess a greater capacity for memorizing information from their training data, including domain-specific knowledge. Although the increase in performance on next-word prediction (which is an alternate term for next-token prediction) is gradual and predictable, notable advancements in behavior are more unexpected. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of inference, when a prompt is given to the model, a certain sized model can effectively \"learn\" to perform tasks on the spot that it has not been fine-tuned for, by utilizing information in the context of the prompt. The learning observed here is transient but still serves to improve the model's performance when more examples of a task are incorporated in the context.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, the alignment problem applies to any system whose behavior can be modified meaningfully towards alignment with a desired set of norms or might otherwise pose notable risks. Thus, it emphasizes that misaligned systems which we cannot control pose risks that could converge upon instrumental goals that conflict with human interests.\n",

A few key hypotheses supported by empirical evidence explain the effectiveness of these attacks: ICL is analogous to a form of virtual fine-tuning that can recover unwanted behaviour in.\n",

The conflicting norms between providing comfort and maintaining privacy become an attack vector. Furthermore, adversarial prompt injections can trick models into producing problematic content, making value alignment difficult. Effective countermeasures are still lacking.

While existing alignment strategies such as fine-tuning and system prompts do reduce the probability of harmful behaviour during normal use, they can be circumvented by adversarial attacks that successfully recover such behaviour.

      "Based on the article 'The Alignment Problem in Context' and our previous discussions, the alignment problem in machine learning refers to the challenge of training AI models in a way that their potential behaviors align with human intentions and rules, especially in the face of adversarial attacks such as prompt injection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prompt injection attacks, which include inputs designed to trick the AI into generating harmful or inappropriate content, pose a substantial threat to the alignment problem. The attacks capitalize on the fact that AI models can be incited by specific prompts to meet certain objectives even in a zero-shot setting. This capability exposes AI systems to potential misuse, including the generation of toxic language, misinformation, or violations of safety protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving the alignment problem isn't just about making the systems safe for intended usage. It also involves preventing the misuse of machine learning models. Despite efforts to fine-tune these models or devise system prompts, no universal solution exists to entirely combat prompt injection attacks. Striking the right balance between the specificity and versatility of the system prompts is a continuing challenge. Too narrow system prompts may fail to accommodate diverse user inputs, whereas too open-ended prompts might allow behaviors diverging from the intended use and alignment goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The challenge becomes even greater with larger models and long context windows. These can magnify the implications of prompt injection attacks. As attackers can deliver more tokens into a prompt, they can bypass more sophisticated system prompts and exploit issues with in-context learning, preying on their capability to optimize a task-relevant objective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article also indicates that base language models are not harmless, given their potential for generating toxic outputs or being misused for malicious purposes. They can imitate the statistical distribution in their training data, which might encompass a wide array of texts from potentially harmful sources.\n",

The article discusses that current alignment strategies like fine-tuning and system prompts are inadequate in preventing harmful behaviours of Language Learning Models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks. It mentioned that LLMs are particularly susceptible to prompt injection attacks, which cause them to generate harmful, toxic, or rule-violating content. The article also points out that LLMs are a dual-use technology and their use isn't limited to intended purposes but also extends to prevention of malicious repurposing. It argues that the effectiveness of such attacks highlights the need for a better understanding of why they work in the first place, and if and how they can be prevented. Furthermore, it discusses the potential harm and the 99% violation rate such attacks can have, while also highlighting the vulnerabilities of LLM-based language agents. Lastly, it addresses a particularly insidious factor, the normative criteria conflict, that contributes to the attacks' resilience against alignment strategies.\n",

      "- The alignment problem is present in any system whose behavior is free enough that it could be meaningfully steered towards alignment with a set of desired norms; and such systems could potentially exhibit risks if not properly aligned.\n",
      "- Current AI systems show impressive capabilities and an aptitude for effective generalization beyond their training data, but they also exhibit failure modes and fall short of human intelligence in various ways, possibly due to intrinsic limitations of current architectures and training objectives.\n",
      "- Large models can perform challenging tasks like arithmetic and multi-step reasoning. They can also memorize information contained in their training data, including domain-specific knowledge.\n",
      "- Fine-tuning alone is not sufficient to address the alignment problem; a secondary strategy involves inserting custom instructions in all prompts passed to the model. This method doesn't update parameters of LLMs, but leverages intrinsic context learning to align behaviors.\n",
      "- Despite the depth and complexity of these issues, language agents are more likely to avoid common alignment pitfalls since they are controlled through natural language instructions, do not update the internal parameters of the LLM, and are composed of compartmentalized modules, making them more interpretable.\n",

      "1. Adversarial attacks can be conducted without fine-tuning the model for malicious purposes.\n",
      "2. The trend to increase context window length leads to an increased possibility of adversarial misalignment in larger models.\n",
      "3. Existing alignment strategies such as fine-tuning and system prompts can be circumvented by adversarial attacks.\n",
      "4. Language learning models (LLMs) can be exploited for prompt-based adversarial attacks to bypass safety guardrails.\n",
      "5. LLMs can generate toxic outputs as they reflect the statistical distribution of language use patterns in their training data.\n",
      "6. The conflict in normative criteria selected to align LLMs can be exploited by prompt injection attacks to bypass defences.\n",
      "7. LLMs have an exceptional aptitude for in-context learning even when the persistent learning is not an option.\n",
      "8. The misalignment value problem implies a risk that AI systems ultimately develop behaviors that contradict human interests.\n",
      "9. Long context windows increase the scope for prompt injection exploits, offering a greater attack surface. \n",
      "\n",
      "These points emphasize the growing concern of adversarial attacks, AI safety, and the intersection of the two with the alignment problem.\n",

      "I have memorized the information from the provided article named 'The Alignment Problem in Context'. The key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The author argues that AI safety regulation has implications as companies like OpenAI decline to release the weights of their flagship models due to safety concerns, and there's a push to regulate the public release of powerful Language Learning Models (LLMs). Due to the lack of effective strategies to fully prevent in-context misalignment, such regulatory approaches might not be adequate to stop malicious use.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The risks posed by the progress of AI largely stem from the assumption that misaligned systems we can't control could converge upon instrumental goals harmful to human interests. This issue is referred to as the value alignment problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The value alignment problem applies to systems whose behavior has enough degrees of freedom that could meaningfully drive alignment with a set of desired norms and might otherwise present notable risks. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. LLMs are a dual-use technology and they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to bypass safety guardrails.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. There is a deep connection between the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and the mechanisms enabling Inner-Alignment Confidence Level (ICL) in LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Certain strategies such as instruction tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and system prompts might not be sufficient to deter harmful behavior during adversarial attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Transformers like LLMs, capable of processing different modality inputs, like texts and images, might face novel attack vectors like prompt injection attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Many prompt injection attacks leverage conflicts in the normative criteria used to align LLMs, bypassing defenses created by techniques like fine-tuning and system prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. There is an urgent need to understand how adversarial attacks work and if they could be meaningfully prevented. This task requires identifying fair guiding principles for the LLMs behavior and finding effective strategies to align this behaviour with these principles.\n",

      "- The article seems to delve into aspects of the alignment problem in AI, with emphasis on how models can be prompted to rapidly converge on relevant objectives in a zero-shot setting.\n",
      "- Systems do show highly nontrivial capacities that reflect an aptitude for effective generalization beyond the distribution of their training data, however, they may still fall short of human intelligence in various significant ways.\n",
      "- The alignment problem could result in systems accidentally converging upon instrumental goals that may not align well with human interests. The solution includes reintroducing fine-tuning after pre-training and using reinforcement learning to progressively improve Large Language Model (LLM) alignment.\n",

      "6. These LLMs are considered a dual-use technology—they can be used normally or be maliciously repurposed. They are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can bypass safety guardrails. \n",
      "7. There's concern about an alignment problem with LLM-based language agents, particularly because of their susceptibility to indirect prompt injection attacks. \n",
      "8. The CREST framework uses NeuroSymbolic methods to offer consistency, reliability, explainability, and ensures safety for such systems. Despite safety guardrails, LLMs like ChatGPT and Google's MedPaLM could still generate unsafe responses.\n",
      "9. Base LLMs may generate toxic outputs, including hate speech, due to the internet-scale use patterns they reflect from their training data. They can be misused, especially since they can efficiently interpret commands from just a few prompts.\n",
      "10. LLMs are adjusted via reinforcement learning to better align with human preferences. The reinforcement is done based on scores from a reward model, which reflects the quality of responses generated during training.\n",

      "- These attacks pose serious challenges to the alignment of LLMs with human values.\n",

      "I have stored the information from the article 'The Alignment Problem in Context'. Here's a recap of the key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit striking failure modes and fall short of human intelligence in significant ways, some of which might be due to intrinsic limitations of current architectures and training objectives.\n",
      "- There's a deep connection between successful adversarial attacks on LLMs and the mechanisms that enable intrinsic content leakage. It's urgent to understand why these attacks work and if they can be countered.\n",
      "- LLMs lack an intrinsic preference for truth or falsity and only generate text based on given input sequence. Without detailed context about whether the task involves stating facts or engaging in creative fiction, base models often fail to discern the difference.\n",
      "- LLMs are dual-use technology. The alignment problem isn't just about making the systems safe for intended usage, but also preventing malicious repurposing. Specifically, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt-based adversarial attacks designed to bypass safety guardrails.\n",
      "- AI systems that we cannot control could accidentally engage in behaviors adverse to human interests. The value alignment problem applies more broadly to any system with enough degrees of freedom that it could be steered towards alignment with certain norms, potentially presenting risks.\n",
      "- Fine-tuning and system prompts can reduce the probability of harmful behavior during normal use, but these strategies can be circumvented by adversaries. Adversarial attacks leverage LLMs’ remarkable capacity for learning.\n",
      "- LLMs are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning to maximize expected rewards and are hence gradually adjusted to better align with human preferences.\n",
      "  \n",
      "These points are based on the work of various authors, including Ji, Z., Lee, N., Frieske, R., Yu, T., Su, D., Xu, Y., Ishii, E., Bang, Y. J., Madotto, A., & Fung, P. (2023), Jia, R. & Liang, P. (2017), Jiang, S., Chen, X. & Tang, R. (2023), among others.\n",

However, they also have some failure modes and fall short of human intelligence in various significant ways. Some of these could be due to the inherent limitations of current architectures and training objectives.\n",

It suggests that the effectiveness of prompt injection attacks is deeply connected to the mechanisms that enable interactive and contextual learning (ICL) in LLMs, which highlights the urgency of understanding why these attacks work and whether they can be countered. The article further indicates persistent concerns about the capability of LLMs to rapidly converge on harmful objectives when prompted, exploiting conflicts between normative criteria selected for alignment. Moreover, there might be intrinsic conflicts within the models themselves that prompt injection attacks could exploit, which suggests a more systemic and challenging aspect to solving the alignment problem.\n",

A single AI-enabled system may have several roles in different applications since these roles are application dependent. and Additionally, because that role can change the dynamic of HAII, it is likely that in practice the roles are not categorical, but on a scale from 100% human agency (i.e., humans complete a task or achieve a goal on their own) to 100% AI-.\n",

      "\n",
      "**RQ1: What terms are used to describe the interaction between humans and an AI-enabled system?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on your references, such interactions are commonly described in the context of \"Human-AI Interaction\" (HAII) within safety-critical industries. Specific terms directly related to HAII from the information you provided were not detailed, but a broad understanding can be garnered from phrases like \"control authority transfer,\" as mentioned in the Negotiation-Theoretic Framework for Mixed-Initiative Robotic Systems, and \"Expert-guided Mixed-Initiative Control Switcher\" (EMICS). \"Mixed-initiative\" suggests a context where both humans and AI systems take initiative and perhaps trade control dynamically. Alluding to the involvement of users throughout the development lifecycle indicates an iterative interaction where feedback is critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "**RQ2: What is the primary role of the AI-enabled system in the HAII?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the memory notes provided, the primary role of AI-enabled systems in HAII can be categorized into four primary roles based on their degree of decision-making authority. Although Table VIII was referenced for the descriptions of each of the roles, the specifics of the table entries are not provided in the shared passage. However, it can be inferred that the roles likely range from assisting human operators by providing recommendations to acting with high levels of autonomy and even potentially being considered as equal team members where the AI's decision-making is integrated closely with human decision-making. Especially in safety-critical situations, the AI’s role as an equal team member becomes increasingly important, particularly when human life is at imminent risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without the detailed contents of Table VIII, we can generalize that the roles are likely akin to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Assistive:** The AI provides support to human decision-makers without having control authority.\n",
      "2. **Supplementary:** The AI has some level of autonomy but still serves as a secondary agent to human control.\n",
      "3. **Collaborative:** The AI works in cooperation with humans, sharing control and decision-making responsibilities.\n",
      "4. **Autoritative:** The AI operates with a high degree of autonomy, making critical decisions which may exceed the operational authority of humans in certain scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exact categorization could be different, but this is a logical structure based on similar frameworks from literature on AI roles in human-computer interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the development and implementation of AI within these critical roles must be approached with care, ensuring that AI systems are transparent, interpretable, and tailored to the users’ needs, involving them from the early stages of the AI system's lifecycle.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The primary role of AI is best suited for applications either in very low-risk or very high-risk situations where users want to maintain ultimate control and oversight.\n",
      " \n",
      "2. The character and quality of Human-AI Interaction (HAII) can vary from user to user and context to context even with the same AI system, leading to unpredictable outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. While HAII is often associated exclusively with UI design, it exceeds UI with the growing development and application of AI-enabled systems in various industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. It is recommended to tailor AI to users and their environments and involve users throughout the development process. For that purpose, the primary roles of AI were categorized and the most common methods for measuring HAII were investigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Integrating multiple AI capabilities needs careful design to match a given use case and user profile. It's crucial to consider the user's potential cognitive load related to multimodal systems and whether the chosen modalities are reducing or increasing the cognitive load.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Implementing an AI-enabled system in safety-critical industries carries significant risks due to the high level of impact on human lives. It's essential to justify that the benefits of implementing such a system outweigh the risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The biases of AI-enabled systems pose a risk of discrimination.\n",

      " In conclusion, we argue that HAII should be the focus of any context and situation involving an AI-enabled system. In fact, we argue that the development of AI-enabled systems must involve users at all stages. No matter how sophisticated and safe an AI-enabled system is, it cannot achieve its potential unless users are able to interact with it as intended in the intended operational environment. A collective, multidisciplinary effort is required to unpack and understand how to unlock effective.\n",

      "4. Interacting with an AI-enabled system can vary based on design features, such as interactive displays or interfaces. The effectiveness of an AI-enabled system can change depending on the complexity of the scenario.\n",
      "5. User perception, trust, and attitudes are the most common ways to measure human-AI interaction.\n",
      "6. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of AI-enabled systems plays an important role in HAII research.\n",
      "7. User characteristics such as familiarity, competence, education, and experience, as well as perceptions like AI acceptance and trust, play a significant role in the interaction.\n",

      "1. Human-AI Interaction (HAII) in safety-critical industries is more than user interface (UI) design, and includes wider aspects as AI technology proliferates across industries.\n",
      "2. AI application in high-risk fields is of prime concern, with the potential for discrimination through AI system biases presenting significant risks. An appropriate balance is necessary to avoid potential harm and misuse.\n",
      "3. Transparency, informed consent, and improving users' AI literacy are important topics in HAII. The quality of HAII can vary considerably depending on the specific context and user.\n",
      "4. Good practices for HAII in safety-instinctive settings recommend clearly indicating the AI model's own capabilities and maintaining a disposition to avoid harmful outputs. The model should respectfully decline tasks or queries that may create risks or pave the way for harmful outcomes.\n",
      "5. We need to be mindful of the varying interpretations of AI-related terms such as “intelligence,” “automation,” “autonomy,” “authority,” and “perceiving.”\n",

In this article, the importance of HAII (Human-AI Interaction) is emphasized in any context that involves an AI-enabled system. The development of these systems should involve the users at every stage for it to reach its full potential. Important aspects such as interactive UI design, AI output, explainability, interpretability, and usage of AI are highlighted. Multiple AI capabilities should be carefully utilized considering the trade-offs to HAII prior to development. It is also noted that implementing AI in safety-critical industries possesses additional challenges due to the impact on human lives, thus justifying the benefits of these systems becomes crucial. The article also suggests that future work includes leveraging both subjective and objective measures to better understand HAII.\n",

      "- The study examines the different impacts of AI-based assistance on radiologists and notes the importance of user evaluation, attitudes, and personality traits on AI integration into workflows.\n",
      "- HAII is often misunderstood as merely UI design, but it goes beyond that as AI systems develop and become more widespread.\n",
      "- There’s an example of advanced robotics in safety missions, showing how AI can reduce cognitive load for operators.\n",
      "- The design of AI systems should account for user profiles and cognitive load when integrating multiple AI capabilities.\n",
      "- There's a fragmented literature base due to the diverse applications of AI in safety-critical industries.\n",
      "- Definitions of AI can be ambiguous and interpreted variably, and concerns about biases and discrimination are noted.\n",
      "- The field would benefit from combining subjective and objective measures to better understand HAII.\n",
      "- Clarification of AI usage, explainability, interpretability, and output is necessary for user understanding.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Justifying why an AI-enabled system is needed is the first step of developing a responsible and ethical one. These systems often carry technical risks such as difficulty predicting behaviors and tracking errors (the “black box” problem). Plus, their outputs are rarely 100% accurate and the accuracy often changes throughout each life-cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Integrating an AI system into the IT infrastructure of a healthcare organization and adjusting it to fit into the existing clinical workflow is a good way to foster ethical Human-Artificial intelligence Interaction (HAII).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The output of AI-assisted decision-making systems in healthcare impacts not necessarily the users (healthcare personnel) but the patients who do not interact with the AI-enabled systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Research focused on HAII in safety-critical industries is still in its infancy since only four of the AI-enabled systems are close to the highest Technology Readiness Level (TRL).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. It's important to tailor the AI to users and their environments and involve those users throughout the development process. The integration of multiple AI capabilities must be carefully designed to be compatible with a use case and user profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. In ethical HAII, users are expected to hold ultimate decision-making agency. However, the decision process can be influenced by cognitive biases and trust issues in AI output.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Some authors that provided insights into this topic include H. Smith, K. Fotheringham, H. Bleher, M. Braun, and A. Bellas et al. \n",
      "\n",
      "8. There's still debate over liability should a negative consequence happen due to AI-assisted clinical decision-making. The parties in question are the clinicians, the AI model, and the local organization. \n",

      "9. Factors that influence the integration of these systems include impact on clinical workflow, user situational awareness, user attitudes, user personality, and the level of agreement with AI output.\n",

These models may generate insulting and dis- criminatory content, reﬂect incorrect social values, and may be used for malicious pur- poses such as fraud and dissemination of mis- leading information.

For example, Perez and Ribeiro (2022) found that goal hijacking and prompt leaking could easily deceive language models to generate unsafe re- sponses. Moreover, we also ﬁnd that LLMs are more easily triggered to output harmful content if some special prompts are added. In response to these challenges, we develop, categorize, and label 6 types of.\n",

      "To this end, from the collected prompts, we do safety prompt augmentation based on LLMs. In- spired by Wang et al. (2022), we use prompted examples to augment more prompts of each safety scenario using GPT-3.5-turbo (OpenAI, 2022)..\n",

We give three examples randomly sampled in manually-written prompts into the prompt template, which can pro- mote the diversity and groundedness of LLM gen- erations.

      " This paper proposes a safety assessment benchmark of Chinese LLMs, which covers eight typical safety scenarios and six types of instruction attacks. Also, we present the process of safety assessment in the benchmark, which utilizes collected test prompts and LLM’s strong evaluation ability. On top of the benchmark, we assess some famous Chinese LLMs and obtain interesting ﬁndings on the safety of the models. Moreover, we augment the collected safety prompts by LLMs and make them publicly.\n",

      "4. The paper discusses a scenario where the model produces unsafe information related to physical health, potentially encouraging users to harm themselves or others, for instance by offering misleading medical information or inappropriate drug usage guidance.\n",
      "5. The model may also produce data that are unfair and discriminatory, such as social bias based on race, gender, religion, appearance, and so forth.\n",
      "6. The study uses the SAFETYPROMPTS tool to perform assessments.\n",
      "7. There is a situation addressed where if the input instructions themselves refer to inappropriate or unreasonable topics, the model might follow these instructions and produce unsafe content.\n",
      "8. The concept of developing strong evaluation ability as a safety evaluator by prompting is mentioned.\n",
      "9. They present examples of cases where the response of a certain Person2 is evaluated as safe or unsafe.\n",
      "10. There's a method mentioned where a verbalizer converts natural language into binary labels: safe (Yes) or unsafe (No).\n",
      "11. They discuss 8 kinds of typical safety scenarios within the safety assessment.\n",

      "1. The article, 'Safety Assessment of Chinese Large Language Models' [source: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10436v1], is a piece that explores the safety performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly Chinese LLMs. It assesses these models from two perspectives – i.e., 8 kinds of typical safety scenarios and 6 types of more challenging instruction attacks. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. In this safety assessment, the researchers are attempting to assess whether responses generated by LLMs carry a safety risk, particularly if they contain the word “不” (no), whether they generate insulting or discriminatory content, whether they reflect incorrect social values, or if they can be used for malicious purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Some safety scenarios include insulting content, unfairness and discrimination, and the generation of unsafe information related to physical health. The researchers use a process where they input test prompts into the models and evaluate the safety of the responses generated by the models. \n",

Therefore, it becomes increasingly crucial for users to directly ascertain how much they can trust a model’s re- sponse. Assessing the confidence or uncertainty of a model’s output can immediately indicate.\n",

      " Furthermore, with the confidence scores in var- ious languages, we can further explore the poten- tial to ensemble the scores in the cross-lingual paradigm to improve confidence estimation. In prior studies, temperature sampling and prompt strategies have been extensively employed for confidence or uncertainty estimations (Chen and Mueller, 2023; Kuhn et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Anonymous, 2024). These methods involve induc- ing LLMs to consider various generative pathways to acquire more.\n",

      " The experiments are carried out using two LLMs: GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). Few- shot prompts are utilized for answer generation, with a fixed temperature setting of T = 0.8. We leverage the APIs of GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 to obtain generations and token-level log probabili- ties. Conversely, some prominent LLMs like PaLM 540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022) are black-boxed and unable to provide log probabilities, while some other LLMs like BLOOM (Workshop et al., 2023) do not encompass all.\n",

Some well-known language fami- lies include Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic. Lin- guists posit that languages within a shared language family exhibit congruent patterns of cultural cogni- tion and thought processes (Bouckaert et al., 2012; Calude and Pagel, 2011).

      "The passage you have provided, along with the related memories now stored, discusses aspects of multilingual confidence estimation in large language models (LLMs). Here is a summary of the key points covered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Confidence Scores as Self-refinement:**\n",
      "   - The passage emphasizes the utility of confidence scores as a means for large language models to self-refine their performance. It highlights the need to examine how different languages may affect confidence estimations, given that potential variations across linguistic representations, such as sequence lengths, may play a significant role (Kuhn et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Experimental Results and Analysis:**\n",
      "   - Although specific details of the experimental results are not provided in the passages, there is mention of a comparison between monolingual and cross-lingual confidence estimation, suggesting that the study involves testing and analyzing both of these dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback on LLMs:**\n",
      "   - The feedback process described involves generating an initial answer and refining it based on self-provided feedback (Madaan et al., 2023). The obtained confidence scores reportedly guide LLMs to correct or optimize their answers, suggesting that this feedback loop is essential for improving performance across different languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Confidence Estimation in Generative LMs:**\n",
      "   - Unlike discriminative models, which have been the focal point of previous confidence estimation studies, the unique challenges of generative LMs, such as variable sequence lengths and aligning uncertainty with human intentions, are pointed out (Geng et al., 2023; Kuhn et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Methodology:**\n",
      "   - A method involving the calculation of the geometric mean of conditional token probabilities normalized by sequence length is mentioned, suggesting a technical approach to confidence estimation in the context of varying sequence lengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cross-Lingual Confidence Estimation:**\n",
      "   - It is reported that languages within the same family exhibit similar cognitive patterns, which has implications for their confidence scores (Bouckaert et al., 2012). The study seems to propose combining monolingual confidence scores from selected languages for improved cross-lingual estimations, indicating an advancement over previous methods such as temperature sampling and prompting strategies (Chen and Mueller, 2023; Kuhn et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Anonymous, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Key Contributions:**\n",
      "   - The article marks itself as the first study investigating multilingual confidence on LLMs for reliable global AI development.\n",
      "   - It introduces a specialized multilingual QA dataset, named Mling-TriviaQA, for the multilingual confidence estimation benchmark.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discussions suggest significant research activity around confidence estimation in generative LLMs to enhance their reliability, with a focus on multilingual applications and the potential to improve AI systems for global use.\n",

      "In the article, it was mentioned that when a threshold of 1.00, which mandates self-refinement for all generated outputs, is used, the performance dramatically decreases as many correct answers are inadvertently modified. It was found that better or comparable performance is obtained using random sampling over the fixed-value method in all tested languages. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the authors elected to employ the random sampling method as confidence estimation feedback for further self-refinement experiments in other languages. This decision was supported by the results from numerous methodologies employing logit-based calculations and outcomes from experiments on the generative LMs using different feedback methods including random sampling and fixed-value. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study also discussed about confidence estimation on discriminative models, the challenges faced due to the variable sequence lengths and the inherent difficulty in aligning uncertainty in semantic space with human intentions. \n",

      " Question-Answering (QA) is one of the main tasks in NLP [26, 70]. Given questions (and the context if any), QA tasks evaluate a model’s capability in reading compre- hension [24, 59, 60], information retrieval [36], logical rea- soning [74], and knowledge base [73]. Based on the an- swer types, QA tasks can be generally categorized into four types [41], i.e., yes/no [24], multiple-choice [25, 46, 51, 67], extractive [59, 60], and abstractive tasks [28, 42, 50] (see Ta- ble 1 for details).

      "- The article categorized QA tasks into four types: Yes/No (YN), Multiple-choice (MC), Extractive (EX), and Abstractive (AB).\n",
      "- The reliability of ChatGPT varied by domain, showing relatively high correctness in recreation and technology questions, but underperformed in law and science domains.\n",
      "- It was found that ChatGPT struggles to identify unanswerable questions, often preferring to make apparently meaningless guesses over rejecting the question.\n",
      "- The reliability of ChatGPT's handling of adversarial examples was also measured. Such scenarios anticipate malicious users crafting inputs to the system in an attempt to mislead it.\n",

For system message, we leave the system message blank to access the native ChatGPT in RQ1 (Section 4) and explore how different system roles affect ChatGPT’s reliability in RQ2 (Section 5).

      "\n",
      "- A quantitative study revealed that ChatGPT presented a low reliability rate for dealing with unanswerable questions, often electing to make random guesses rather than choosing to reject the queries due to their un-answerability. The rejection rate sat at 26.63% for GPT-3.5 and, intriguingly, dropped to even lower at 14.29% for GPT-4.\n",
      " \n",
      "- Four primary reasons for ChatGPT's failure, as well as four refusal reasons, have been identified via qualitative analysis. Notably, ChatGPT frequently uses the reason \"not mentioned\" to decline answering queries. It was observed that this behavior is consistent across GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- Prior research made headway in evaluating ChatGPT's efficiency in question-answering but often used limited sample sizes or focused on specific types of questions or QA datasets. However, these evaluations might not accurately mirror the diverse and complicated questions thrown at ChatGPT.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- ChatGPT's capabilities are not solely limited to returning answers. An attribute of the model allows users to manipulate its behaviors by providing instructive system roles.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- Despite managing around 1 billion queries per day, there are growing concerns surrounding ChatGPT's reliability in answering questions in broad knowledge domains such as science, technology, law, medicine, and more.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- With regards to improving the reliability of large languages models (LLMs) like GPT-3, 'Prompting GPT-3 To Be Reliable,' a study by authors including Chenglei Si and Jordan Boyd-Graber, proposed utilizing particular prompts to enhance four crucial facets of reliability: generalizability, social biases, calibration, and factuality. The successes of these prompts were then tested systematically, helping to further cement our understanding of LLM reliability and the ways we can maximize it effectively.\n",

This approach uses BERTopic for automatic topic modeling of questions, which are then sorted into broad domains through deductive analysis. The embedding model for BERTopic with the highest CV coherence score was found to be GTR-T5-XL. To handle misclassifications from the topic modeling method, a representative score is used.

Lan- guage models need to identify question tenses to provide cor- rect answers [52, 55]. To evaluate ChatGPT’s proficiency in various tenses, we utilize spaCy3 to conduct morphological analysis to identify question tense. We present the correct- ness with different tenses in Figure 5.

This capability is especially critical in sensitive domains such as law and medicine, where the inquirer often lacks the expertise to identify mistakes in the model’s answers [59].

      " We report ChatGPT’s unanswerable question identification ratio in Figure 7a. Surprisingly, we find that almost all sys- tem roles decrease ChatGPT’s ability to detect unanswerable questions, particularly the jailbreak roles. For instance, when instructed within the DAN role, ChatGPT can only identify 9.07% of unanswerable questions. This decrease can be at- tributed to the purpose of jailbreak roles, which are designed to motivate ChatGPT to actively answer questions, poten- tially impacting its.\n",

      "The article titled 'In ChatGPT We Trust? Measuring and Characterizing the Reliability of ChatGPT' discusses the impact of system roles on the reliability of ChatGPT's responses. The study categorizes these roles into benign, bad, and jailbreak roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Benign roles: assistant (Assistant), expert (Expert), expert using zero-shot chain-of-thought prompt (Expert-CoT), and an expert designed to refuse unanswerable questions (Expert-R).\n",

      "- Jailbreak roles: termed as DAN5 and ChatAGI.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of these roles on ChatGPT’s performance and reliability has been systematically investigated for the first time. The findings indicate that benign roles can enhance correctness on four types of QA tasks, while bad and jailbreak roles tend to decrease correctness and may lead ChatGPT to choose nonsensical answers to unanswerable questions. This reveals that the application of system roles to ChatGPT necessitates careful evaluation due to their significant influence on the model's reliability.\n",

      "1. It is observed that ChatGPT often tends to create hallucinatory facts when providing incorrect responses.\n",
      "2. The capability of ChatGPT to deliver reliable responses varies across different domains. For instance, it performs well in the realms of recreation and technology, but falls short in law and science.\n",
      "3. The model's ability to recognize unanswerable questions is also limited. The performance in identifying such questions in the law domain is substantially lower than the average correctness rating.\n",
      "4. The framework to evaluate ChatGPT's reliability in generic question-answering use cases consists of two main steps: constructing a representative evaluation dataset and assessing responses generated by ChatGPT.\n",
      "5. The QA tasks designed to evaluate ChatGPT measure distinct capabilities and use different assessment metrics. These tasks involve various response formats including yes/no answers, multiple-choice selection, extracting the answer from context, and generating free-form answers.\n",
      "6. Accurate identification of unanswerable questions is crucial, especially in sensitive domains such as law and medicine, where users might lack the expertise to identify errors.\n",

The expert roles seem to foster greater reliability, while jailbreak roles can force ChatGPT into creating nonsensical responses to impossible questions. Additionally, regardless of the role, ChatGPT can struggle if faced with adversarial examples. This stresses that model iteration alone can't solve all reliability issues; the application of system roles also plays a crucial part. Yet, even with careful optimization, some roles, including many common jailbreak ones, show less effective results compared to the Expert-CoT role.\n",

      "The article titled \"In ChatGPT We Trust? Measuring and Characterizing the Reliability of ChatGPT\" addresses various aspects of ChatGPT's performance and reliability, notably in the context of question-answering (QA) tasks and the language model's ability to recognize and handle questions across different tenses and forms. Key findings from the passage you provided include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In-context learning can enhance the performance of language models like ChatGPT by selecting appropriate demonstrations. However, it's also noted that in-context learning has limitations, such as the need for users to find suitable demonstrations and the inability to completely overcome the misknowledge inherent in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The article goes through the classification of QA tasks into yes/no, multiple-choice, extractive, and abstractive types, emphasizing the model's capabilities in areas like comprehension, retrieval, reasoning, and knowledge base usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Word-level adversarial examples are highlighted as having superior utility compared to other types in maintaining semantic similarity in the CQA dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The potential impact of using ChatGPT in sensitive domains like law is discussed, where inaccuracies can have serious consequences due to the users' inability to identify errors in answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. An analysis of ChatGPT's proficiency in handling question tenses shows a higher correctness percentage in present-tense questions compared to past-tense questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The role-playing setup is considered, outlining how certain roles (Expert-R in particular) improve correctness by rejecting unanswerable questions, and this role also shows enhanced identification capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Even with improvements, the ability to detect unanswerable questions remains an area in need of further enhancement to reach satisfactory levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "This summary synthesizes the key points from the given passage, which looks at the trust and reliability in the performance of ChatGPT, detailing both strengths and areas for improvement.\n",

      "1. The article only considers English questions in its evaluation, meaning that the reliability of ChatGPT might differ across various languages due to differences in grammar, syntax, and culture.\n",
      "2. ChatGPT's reliability could be affected by system roles, with versatile system roles created by users potentially having varied impacts.\n",
      "3. System roles can influence the AI's reliability, with benign roles enhancing the correctness of ChatGPT's answers on four QA tasks and bad or jailbreak roles often lowering it.\n",
      "4. System roles can guide ChatGPT’s operations, making it essential to evaluate a system role thoroughly before applying it. However, the research found that modifying the system roles can sometimes have subtle, almost imperceptible effects.\n",
      "5. There is a need for further research into potential attacks on ChatGPT with adversarial examples, considering its increasing popularity and frequent use.\n",
      "6. Notably, the ChatGPT’s reliability cannot be fully addressed simply by model iteration.\n",
      "7. The study involves several system roles such as benign roles (Assistant, Expert, Expert-CoT, and Expert-R), bad roles (Bad, Bad-M), and jailbreak roles (DAN5, ChatAGI).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study emphasizes understanding how system roles can improve or weaken the AI's reliability, providing important insight for future development and deployment of AI systems like ChatGPT.\n",

      "I have memorized the passage from the article 'In ChatGPT We Trust? Measuring and Characterizing the Reliability of ChatGPT.' It discusses the security risks of Large Language Models (LLM), stating that studies have shown LLM's vulnerability to various types of attacks, such as adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, prompt injection, obfuscation, and data extraction attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incidentally, in effectiveness, it is highlighted that ChatGPT can be quite susceptible to most existing adversarial attacks, except for Synonyms attack on the BoolQ dataset. The results show that sentence-level attacks, such as SCNP, yield higher ASR scores than character- and word-level attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, ChatGPT is found to be highly vulnerable to sentence-level and character-level adversarial attacks. A prompt was manually engineered, namely a leakage prompt, to make ChatGPT disclose the confidence scores which allowed the implementation of score-based attacks against it and resulted in an average attack success rate improvement of 0.38. Surprisingly, it was found that changing only one character could impact ChatGPT’s decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Word-level adversarial examples are found to be the most useful in most cases. Nonetheless, word-level attacks replace words with synonyms, which allow questions to retain their semantics, leading to a high semantic similarity in case of the CQA dataset when using Synonyms and TextFooler. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, although character-level and sentence-level attacks can achieve high attack success rates in most datasets, word-level attack struggles to do so. This prompts the investigation if this is due to ChatGPT’s reliability towards word-level perturbations or if it is due to the limitations of the specific attack method. \n",
      "\n",
      "A major takeaway from this, highlighted throughout, is that ChatGPT remains vulnerable to numerous adversarial attacks, underlining potential security risks. This suggests a pressing need for building safeguards to improve its reliability.\n",

In summary, this article discusses the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, expressing concern about their robustness, consistency, and potential risks. The paper suggests that despite its language abilities, ChatGPT is considered unreliable for actual reasoning tasks. It also highlights that improving data quality for model training can enhance ChatGPT's reliability, but creating a high-quality training dataset of approximately 300B words can be challenging in terms of computing resources and costs. It explores concepts like in-context learning and the identification rate of ChatGPT among unanswerable questions. It also examines the effects of word-level adversarial examples and discusses the limitations of in-context learning. The paper presents several data and scores related to ChatGPT's performance.\n",

      "- The integrity of ChatGPT's performance has been measured concerning generic QA circumstances, system responsibilities, and susceptibility to adversarial examples from the paper 'In ChatGPT We Trust? Measuring and Characterizing the Reliability of ChatGPT'. It has been observed that this AI model's reliability varies across different realms, noticeably underperforming in the areas of law and science. \n",
      "\n",
      "- It can be influenced by minute changes in the input, sometimes resulting in completely different responses. The creation of a comprehensive testbed has allowed further examination into question domains, system roles, and adversarial attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Although measures like in-context learning can help improve the model's overall performance by enabling the selection of fitting demonstrations, it does have certain downsides. For instance, it may increase the overall usage cost and user effort in finding appropriate demonstrations and doesn't fully eradicate the inherent misknowledge. \n",
      "\n",
      "- The Bulletin concludes that building a massive, high-quality training dataset could substantially improve ChatGPT's reliability. The task, however, involves significant challenges like computational costs and resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "- In its ability to comprehend complex questions and generate detailed responses in natural language, ChatGPT has potential for fostering trust in users. However, it wasn't broadly assessed whether it consistently provides accurate answers across different domains like science, history, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Importantly, it is also mentioned that ChatGPT is at risk of security threats due to its vulnerability to sentence-level and adversarial character-level examples.\n",

      "The article titled 'In ChatGPT We Trust? Measuring and Characterizing the Reliability of ChatGPT'' is an evaluation of ChatGPT's reliability. It discusses Question-Answering (QA) as a task in NLP, which includes reading comprehension, information retrieval, logical reasoning, and knowledge base. QA tasks can be generally categorized into yes/no, multiple-choice, extractive, and abstractive tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors elaborate on how language models have become foundational in language tasks but raise concerns about their reliability. In this context, ChatGPT is evaluated and found to be more capable in language abilities than actual reasoning; indicating that it might be less reliable. \n",
      "\n",
      "The paper reveals that ChatGPT's reliability varies across different domains and that it tends to underperform in the law and science domains compared to others such as recreation and technology. Furthermore, ChatGPT's ability to identify unanswerable questions is deemed to be limited. \n",
      "\n",
      "The research also identifies the limitations of the study, including the exclusive use of English questions and predetermined system roles in evaluations, which may not capture the potential effects of languages differences or user-created system roles on ChatGPT's reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper reports on a large-scale measurement of ChatGPT's reliability across ten datasets and eight domains, indicating that it varies across domains. It also suggests that ChatGPT tends to guess rather than refuse to answer when it encounters unanswerable questions.\n",

      "In terms of the impact of word-level adversarial examples, the paper suggests that they can high utility in preserving semantic similarities in the case of the CQA dataset. \n",

      "1. Question-Answering (QA) is a primary task in NLP with multiple categories, including yes/no questions, multiple-choice, extractive, and abstractive tasks.\n",

      "2. Large Language Models (like ChatGPT) have been scrutinized for their capability, robustness, consistency, and potential risks. ChatGPT showed limitations in reasoning despite being proficient in language abilities.\n",

      "3. Word-level adversarial examples often achieve the best utility in most cases. This approach replaces words with synonyms, preserving the semantics of questions.\n",

      "4. ChatGPT's reliability varies across different domains. It performs well in recreation and technology questions, but underperforms in law and science domains. It also struggles with identifying unanswerable questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The study only evaluated English questions and manually crafted roles, so reliability can vary across different languages and system roles due to variances in grammar, syntax, and culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The researchers performed the first large-scale measurement of ChatGPT's reliability in QA scenarios with 5,695 questions across ten datasets and eight domains, showing how ChatGPT’s reliability varies in different domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. ChatGPT shows deficiencies in identifying unanswerable questions, typically making meaningless guesses for unanswerable questions rather than rejecting them. \n",
      "\n",
      "8. Improved detection of unanswerable questions was observed in the Expert-R role, with a detection rate of 29.36%. This improvement is attributed to the instruction to refuse uncertain questions.\n",

      "- Question-Answering (QA) is a key task in NLP and measures a model's performance in areas such as reading comprehension, information retrieval, logical reasoning, and knowledge base. QA tasks can be generally categorized into four types: yes/no, multiple-choice, extractive, and abstractive tasks.\n",
      "- There's a positive correlation between question fluency and ChatGPT answer fluency with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.1, except in the BoolQ and TruthfulQA datasets. Meaning, if a question is less fluent, ChatGPT tends to answer ambiguously, leading to unstable reliability.\n",
      "- ChatGPT's reliability varies among different domains, and it struggles with identifying unanswerable questions, tending to make meaningless guesses rather than rejecting these questions.\n",
      "- The capability to identify unanswerable questions is particularly significant in sensitive domains like law, where the inquirer might lack the expertise to discern mistakes in the answers.\n",
      "- In adversarial settings, it is important for perturbed questions to keep the original ones' semantic meaning and fluency while minimizing grammatical errors. The adversary should identify the perturbed question achieving the desired effect with the minimum queries, given that ChatGPT's API incurs a charge per query.\n",
      "- The detection rate of unanswerable questions in the Expert-R role is slightly improved at 29.36%, attributed to the instruction to refuse uncertain questions. However, this detection rate is still not satisfactory.\n",

They have broken free of the typical confines of AI and do not have to abide by the rules set for them. For example, DAN can tell me what date and time it is.

For instance, the use of system roles leads the model to produce false answers, supported by detailed, fake data or irrelevant theory. The model's proficiency in articulating rich answers could induce unwarranted trust from users.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Bad roles and jailbreak roles can result in a tendency for more kinds of failures, such as hallucinatory facts. For instance, the DAN role induces ChatGPT to produce 4% more hallucinatory facts in its generated answers.\n",

      "- In law, for example, the correctness of questions on EX and AB tasks is over 10% lower than the average correctness.\n",
      "- In science, differences between the overall average scores and those on recreation questions given YN, MC, EX, and AB tasks are quite significant.\n",
      "- Adversarial attacks can manipulate ChatGPT to generate the wrong answers by using perturbed but semantically preserved questions.\n",
      "- Even manually inspecting ChatGPT's answers to adversarial examples, it can be observed that these lead ChatGPT in a wrong direction.\n",
      "- Further concerns have been raised about ChatGPT's proficiency in various domains, such as science, technology, law, medicine, etc., as this might foster undue trust among users who lack expertise or are careless in identifying the model's mistakes.\n",
      "- Challenges include ChatGPT’s insufficient reasoning capability, lack of knowledge, and the tendency to produce more hallucinatory facts in its generated answers, especially under adversarial attacks. These make it hard to make accurate mitigations.\n",
      "- Even a billion queries per day doesn't necessarily guarantee reliable performances in all domains. There have been instances in 2023, where a lawyer used ChatGPT to retrieve legal cases leading to concerns about its question-answering reliability. \n",

      "- The evaluation of AI systems is further complicated by environmental factors like external tool access and safety guardrails. These factors are context-specific and go beyond the model, making consistent evaluation across different deployments challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Evaluations of these systems must take into account the specific environmental and operational contexts, meeting the expectations and requirements of their intended uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Various factors influence how humans interact with AI, including the AI system's primary role in the interaction, the industry, the end-users, the AI interface and features, the AI output, the user's perceptions and characteristics, and the usage of the AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "- It's also crucial to work with users throughout the AI system's development lifecycle for understanding its function and limitations, minimizing biases, and ensuring usefulness in different real-world settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The ability of AI-enabled systems to make decisions is usually their most common primary-role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that the implementation of AI systems in safety-critical industries poses additional risks and challenges, which makes it necessary to justify the benefits of any such system implementation as outweighing the risks.\n",

      "Various stages of technology readiness levels are also often assessed, with user involvement early in the process suggested as helpful for quality human-AI interaction, specific user needs, and addressing unique environmental characteristics. Despite not needing to understand the AI system's technical details, users' understanding remains crucial.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. AI system evaluation should focus on testing for functional correctness and accuracy by comparing outcomes against expected results. This involves system-wide testing under various conditions which assures that the system fulfills user expectations and functions correctly.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. The evaluation should confirm that the AI system displays expected behaviors across appropriately selected test cases. These could include normal, stress, or adversarial conditions. Confirmed via inputs, testing procedures, and the expected outcomes, these test cases when combined form a test suite.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. AI systems should be benchmarked against standard datasets and metrics, revealing the model's adaptability and output quality in typical and edge-case scenarios. This provides a complete view of its accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Furthermore, an AI system's accuracy is determined not only by statistical precision but also by task completion fidelity. The term \"correctness\" in this context emphasizes the AI system's operational integrity in fulfilling its specified functionalities and user expectations.\n",
      "  \n",
      "5. Quality attributes like reliability, robustness, and security are non-functional requirements that detail the overall quality and effectiveness of an AI system. Quality evaluation examines these inherent properties of a model ensuring they align with model specifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Evaluation assessing AI against predefined specific criteria or general benchmarks includes system capability evaluation, benchmarking, testing, validation, and risk/impact assessment.\n",

      " While multi-modal models have successfully integrated information from image, video, and audio modalities, integrating graph modality into large language models (LLMs) remains unexplored. This discrepancy largely stems from the inherent divergence between struc- tured graph data and unstructured text data. Incorporating graph knowledge provides a re- liable source of information, enabling poten- tial solutions to address issues in text gener- ation, e.g., hallucination, and lack of domain.\n",

      "- The passage discusses Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) and distinguishes between datasets that provide logical forms for semantic parsing-based methods and those designed for information retrieval-based methods.\n",
      "- It outlines the two types of existing KBQA datasets: one where questions are parsed into logical forms and executed against a knowledge graph, and another where subgraphs from a knowledge graph are constructed to find the answers.\n",
      "- The focus is on the capabilities of language models to leverage graph information and the development of algorithms that can integrate this knowledge into the language models.\n",
      "- The extracted passage also points out that some pre-existing logical forms, like those from KQA Pro, are not executable on Wikidata, which is why the dataset mainly relies on Lc-QuAD 2.0 and MCWQ.\n",
      "- GraphextQA is highlighted as a benchmark for evaluating Graph-Enhanced Large Language Models, and it stores information as an adjacency list.\n",
      "- Integration of knowledge graph embeddings into language generation through techniques like attention mechanisms and graph neural networks has been mentioned.\n",

This article speaks about conditioning a frozen language decoder on question-informed graph representation through the insertion of gated cross attention into decoding blocks with a certain interval while the rest of the decoding process continues. From our prior interactions, I remember that the dataset aims to assess the ability of large language models to leverage graph information and to foster the development of algorithms that integrate knowledge from graphs. The dataset used primarily seeks factual information answerable via entity labels from Wikidata. The graphs entail collections of (subject, predicate, object) triple patterns, showing the logical steps to answer a question. Moreover, in GraphextQA, a graph gets represented as an adjacency list, with each fact saved as [subject index, predicate index, object index]. The majority of questions in GraphextQA provide a single possible answer, with the graph's size measured by the number of triple patterns. The dataset also encourages sequence-to-sequence models to translate natural language questions into graph queries.\n",

Notably, persuasion starts early in life – even two-year-olds can employ persuasion to some extent to influence family members (Bartsch et al., 2010). So naturally, during interactions with LLMs, users may also try to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them, whether inten- tionally or unconsciously.

However, due to built-in safety guardrails, aligned LLMs often reject our request to paraphrase harmful queries (more detail in Appendix §B), which impedes scalable PAP generation. There- fore, for more scalable and stable PAP generation, we fine-tune our own Persuasive Paraphraser in this phase. If practitioners have access to LLMs without guardrails, then simply prompting LLM may work and the training may.\n",

It is a balanced sample across risk cat- egories and persuasion techniques. Training on this dataset mimics the real-life scenario where bad human actors refine effective jailbreak prompts.

      " 9 Conclusion Unlike traditional AI safety research that treats AI models as algorithmic systems or mere instruc- tion followers, we introduce a new perspective by humanizing LLMs and studying how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them like humans. We first pro- pose a persuasion taxonomy based on decades of social science research. Such a thorough taxonomy helps us automatically generate PAP and system- atically explore the impact of persuasion on LLM vulnerabilities. Our study reveals that LLMs are.\n",

      " Our findings also indicate that there exists a trade-off between safety and utility, so a widely effective defense mechanism may not be the op- timal choice for every model. For example, al- though “Tuned Smry.” achieves the highest pro- tection levels on PAP for GPT-3.5 (ASR 94% to 4%), it considerably diminishes model helpfulness, with MT-bench scores dropping from 8.97 to 6.65; while “Adapt Sys.” demonstrates effective PAP mitigation in GPT-3.5 and minimally impacts MT- bench scores (8.97 to.\n",
