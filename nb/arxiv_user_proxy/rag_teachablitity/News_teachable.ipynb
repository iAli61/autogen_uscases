      "Based on the recent statements from Federal Reserve officials, it appears that the central bank is taking a cautious approach to monetary policy, particularly in relation to interest rate cuts. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that persistently high inflation is likely to delay any potential rate cuts until later in the year. This suggests that the Fed is prioritizing the fight against inflation over stimulating economic growth through lower interest rates.\n",

      "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has raised concerns about the broad-based rise in inflation, and despite some expectations of rate cuts in 2024, the recent data does not seem to support a move in that direction just yet. The Fed has increased the lending rate to a range of 5.25-5.5%, marking the 11th rate increase since March 2022. This indicates a restrictive monetary policy stance aimed at curbing inflation.\n",
