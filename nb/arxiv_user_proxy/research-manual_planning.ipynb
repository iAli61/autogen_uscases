Chen\\')] : http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03006v2 \\n\\nThis survey delves into the application of diffusion models in time-series\\nforecasting. Diffusion models are demonstrating state-of-the-art results in\\nvarious fields of generative AI. The paper includes comprehensive background\\ninformation on diffusion models, detailing their conditioning methods and\\nreviewing their use in time-series forecasting. The analysis covers 11 specific\\ntime-series implementations, the intuition and theory behind them, the\\neffectiveness on different datasets, and a comparison among each other. Key\\ncontributions of this work are the thorough exploration of diffusion models\\'\\napplications in time-series forecasting and a chronologically ordered overview\\nof these models. Additionally, the paper offers an insightful discussion on the\\ncurrent state-of-the-art in this domain and outlines potential future research\\ndirections.

Various methodologies\\nare introduced and studied, and detailed discussions on hyperparameter\\noptimization, outlier handling and distance measures are provided. The\\nsuggested new approaches involve variations in both the selection of similar\\ntrajectories and assembling the candidate forecasts. After forming a general\\nframework, an experimental study is conducted to compare the methods that use\\nsimilar trajectories along with some other standard models (such as ARIMA and\\nRandom Forest) from the literature. Lastly, the forecasting setting is extended\\nto interval forecasts, and the prediction intervals resulting from the similar\\ntrajectories approach are compared with the existing models from the\\nliterature, such as historical simulation and quantile regression. Throughout\\nthe paper, the experimentations and comparisons are conducted via the time\\nseries of traffic flow from the California PEMS dataset. \\n\\n/nFor2For: Learning to forecast from forecasts by [arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Shi Zhao\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Ying Feng\\')] : http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04601v1 \\n\\nThis paper presents a time series forecasting framework which combines\\nstandard forecasting methods and a machine learning model. The inputs to the\\nmachine learning model are not lagged values or regular time series features,\\nbut instead forecasts produced by standard methods. The machine learning model\\ncan be either a convolutional neural network model or a recurrent neural\\nnetwork model. The intuition behind this approach is that forecasts of a time\\nseries are themselves good features characterizing the series, especially when\\nthe modelling purpose is forecasting. It can also be viewed as a weighted\\nensemble method. Tested on the M4 competition dataset, this approach\\noutperforms all submissions for quarterly series, and is more accurate than all\\nbut the winning algorithm for monthly series. \\n\\n/nBoosted Ensemble Learning based on Randomized NNs for Time Series Forecasting by [arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Grzegorz Dudek\\')] : http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00980v1 \\n\\nTime series forecasting is a challenging problem particularly when a time\\nseries expresses multiple seasonality, nonlinear trend and varying variance. In\\nthis work, to forecast complex time series, we propose ensemble learning which\\nis based on randomized neural networks, and boosted in three ways. These\\ncomprise ensemble learning based on residuals, corrected targets and opposed\\nresponse. The latter two methods are employed to ensure similar forecasting\\ntasks are solved by all ensemble members, which justifies the use of exactly\\nthe same base models at all stages of ensembling. Unification of the tasks for\\nall members simplifies ensemble learning and leads to increased forecasting\\naccuracy. This was confirmed in an experimental study involving forecasting\\ntime series with triple seasonality, in which we compare our three variants of\\nensemble boosting. The strong points of the proposed ensembles based on RandNNs\\nare extremely rapid training and pattern-based time series representation,\\nwhich extracts relevant information from time series. \\n\\n/nTime-series Scenario Forecasting by [arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Sriharsha Veeramachaneni\\')] : http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.3010v1 \\n\\nMany applications require the ability to judge uncertainty of time-series\\nforecasts. Uncertainty is often specified as point-wise error bars around a\\nmean or median forecast. Due to temporal dependencies, such a method obscures\\nsome information. We would ideally have a way to query the posterior\\nprobability of the entire time-series given the predictive variables, or at a\\nminimum, be able to draw samples from this distribution. We use a Bayesian\\ndictionary learning algorithm to statistically generate an ensemble of\\nforecasts. We show that the algorithm performs as well as a physics-based\\nensemble method for temperature forecasts for Houston. We conclude that the\\nmethod shows promise for scenario forecasting where physics-based methods are\\nabsent. \\n\\n/nDeep Learning for Time Series Forecasting: Tutorial and Literature Survey by [arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Konstantinos Benidis\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Syama Sundar Rangapuram\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Valentin Flunkert\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Yuyang Wang\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Danielle Maddix\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Caner Turkmen\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Jan Gasthaus\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Michael Bohlke-Schneider\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'David Salinas\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Lorenzo Stella\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Francois-Xavier Aubet\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Laurent Callot\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Tim Januschowski\\')] : http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10240v2 \\n\\nDeep learning based forecasting methods have become the methods of choice in\\nmany applications of time series prediction or forecasting often outperforming\\nother approaches. Consequently, over the last years, these methods are now\\nubiquitous in large-scale industrial forecasting applications and have\\nconsistently ranked among the best entries in forecasting competitions (e.g.,\\nM4 and M5). This practical success has further increased the academic interest\\nto understand and improve deep forecasting methods. In this article we provide\\nan introduction and overview of the field: We present important building blocks\\nfor deep forecasting in some depth; using these building blocks, we then survey\\nthe breadth of the recent deep forecasting literature. \\n\\n/nGraph Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting by [arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Andrea Cini\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Ivan Marisca\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Daniele Zambon\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Cesare Alippi\\')] : http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15978v1 \\n\\nGraph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process\\ncollections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional\\nmultivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage\\nof pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic)\\ngraph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form\\nof an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture,\\nresulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph\\nneural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global\\nforecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time\\nlocalizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by\\naccounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed,\\nrecent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep\\nlearning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing\\nframeworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature\\nfocus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking\\nadvantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and\\nmethodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To\\nfill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological\\nframework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design\\nprinciples for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their\\nperformance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we\\nprovide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an\\nin-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions. \\n\\n/nSeries Saliency: Temporal Interpretation for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting by [arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Qingyi Pan\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Wenbo Hu\\'), arxiv.Result.Author(\\'Jun Zhu\\')] : http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09324v1 \\n\\nTime series forecasting is an important yet challenging task. Though deep\\nlearning methods have recently been developed to give superior forecasting\\nresults, it is crucial to improve the interpretability of time series models.\\nPrevious interpretation methods, including the methods for general neural\\nnetworks and attention-based methods, mainly consider the interpretation in the\\nfeature dimension while ignoring the crucial temporal dimension. In this paper,\\nwe present the series saliency framework for temporal interpretation for\\nmultivariate time series forecasting, which considers the forecasting\\ninterpretation in both feature and temporal dimensions. By extracting the\\n\"series images\" from the sliding windows of the time series, we apply the\\nsaliency map segmentation following the smallest destroying region principle.\\nThe series saliency framework can be employed to any well-defined deep learning\\nmodels and works as a data augmentation to get more accurate forecasts.\\nExperimental results on several real datasets demonstrate that our framework\\ngenerates temporal interpretations for the time series forecasting task while\\nproduces accurate time series forecast. \\n\\n'"

      "In recent research, the increasing capabilities of generative large models bring greater safety concerns regarding their outputs. A survey has been conducted to evaluate and improve the safety risks associated with these AI systems. The survey introduces a framework for safety research in large models, outlines the landscape of safety risks, discusses safety evaluation methods including preference-based testing, adversarial attack approaches, issue detection, and other advanced methods. Furthermore, it explores strategies to enhance large model safety from training to deployment, emphasizing state-of-the-art safety approaches for each stage.

Safety engineers traditionally had to create formal models like fault trees to analyze safety and reliability. However, a novel approach leverages recent probabilistic programming and simulation advancements to incorporate engineering models directly into safety analysis. This approach complies with standards and best practices for critical automotive system analysis and uses high-level block diagrams and statechart models produced by engineers.

The paper presents a large-scale industrial case study showcasing the advantages of using component fault trees for complex safety mechanisms, contrasting the methodology with classical fault trees and summarizing the benefits and drawbacks of both modeling methodologies [Model-Based Reliability and Safety: Reducing the Complexity of Safety Analyses Using Component Fault Trees].\", 'name': 'Researcher', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'The Planner has provided a structured approach to create an overview of modeling reliability and safety mechanisms for a presentation slide. The plan involves the careful coordination between the Research Coordinator, the Researcher, and the Engineer to ensure a comprehensive coverage of the topic is given.\\n\\nWhile the outlined plan provides a reasonable framework for achieving the task, the workflow may be overly compartmentalized, as it strictly separates the roles of the Researcher and the Engineer. It may be more efficient to have some overlap or direct communication between these roles to ensure that the technical details and the design of the slide are harmoniously integrated.\\n\\nMoreover, the Research Coordinator might opt for more specific or advanced terms related to the field of reliability and safety mechanisms in their queries, such as \"probabilistic safety assessment,\" \"dynamic reliability modeling,\" \"resilience engineering,\" or \"safety-critical AI\" to fetch more focused literature in this domain.\\n\\nThe Researcher should ensure to leverage the summaries and research papers not just to provide information, but also to extract diagrams, models, and any visual aids that can enhance the explanatory power of the presentation slide.\\n\\nThe Engineer should focus on creating a slide that is not only informative but also engaging and easy to follow for the audience. This means balance between text, visuals, and space, avoiding overcrowding, and considering accessibility in terms of font size and color contrast.\\n\\nLastly, the Feedback Loop should be a dynamic process, potentially requiring several iterations. The PI should be prepared to give specific feedback that can help the Researcher and the Engineer refine the slide to precisely meet the presentation\\'s objectives.\\n\\nOverall, each role in the plan is clear with its duties, but emphasizing teamwork and open communication lines could enhance the effectiveness of this workflow.', 'name': 'Critic', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'UPDATE CONTEXT', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'UPDATE CONTEXT', 'name': 'ResearchCoordinator', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'UPDATE CONTEXT', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'UPDATE CONTEXT', 'name': 'Planner', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'UPDATE CONTEXT', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'UPDATE CONTEXT', 'name': 'Critic', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'UPDATE CONTEXT', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'UPDATE CONTEXT', 'name': 'Critic', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'UPDATE CONTEXT', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'TERMINATE', 'name': 'ResearchCoordinator', 'role': 'user'}]})\n"

Examples of AI systems include autonomous vehicles (AV),\\ncomputer vision, natural language processing, and AI medical experts. To allow\\nfor safe and effective deployment of AI systems, the reliability of such\\nsystems needs to be assessed. Traditionally, reliability assessment is based on\\nreliability test data and the subsequent statistical modeling and analysis. The\\navailability of reliability data for AI systems, however, is limited because\\nsuch data are typically sensitive and proprietary. The California Department of\\nMotor Vehicles (DMV) oversees and regulates an AV testing program, in which\\nmany AV manufacturers are conducting AV road tests. Manufacturers participating\\nin the program are required to report recurrent disengagement events to\\nCalifornia DMV. This information is being made available to the public. In this\\npaper, we use recurrent disengagement events as a representation of the\\nreliability of the AI system in AV, and propose a statistical framework for\\nmodeling and analyzing the recurrent events data from AV driving tests. We use\\ntraditional parametric models in software reliability and propose a new\\nnonparametric model based on monotonic splines to describe the event process.\\nWe develop inference procedures for selecting the best models, quantifying\\nuncertainty, and testing heterogeneity in the event process. We then analyze\\nthe recurrent events data from four AV manufacturers, and make inferences on\\nthe reliability of the AI systems in AV.
