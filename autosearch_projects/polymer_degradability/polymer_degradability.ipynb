For this reason, polymer additives\\nhave been proposed to be used in flood remediation: in an open channel at a\\nfixed flow rate, the decrease in friction due to polymer addition is expected\\nto lead to a decrease in water height in the channel. However, in a recent\\nfield experiment, a counterintuitive transient increase in water height has\\nbeen observed far downstream of polymer injection. We numerically investigate\\nthe effect of polymer additives on the water height in a long canal using the\\nshallow water equations augmented with an evolution equation for polymer\\nconcentration that incorporates turbulent dispersion and polymer degradation.\\nJust downstream of polymer injection, the water height decreases due to the\\ndecreased friction at a fixed volumetric flow rate. Further downstream,\\nhowever, the height can increase, consistent with the experimental observation.\\nWe elucidate the mechanism of this unexpected rise in water height in the\\ncanal.

      "\n",
      "Welcome to our comprehensive exploration into the cutting-edge field of polymer degradability enhanced by atomistic calculations. The increasing environmental awareness and demand for sustainable materials have thrust the research on polymer degradation into the limelight. Polymers, being versatile and ubiquitous, contribute significantly to our modern lifestyle, but their longevity poses substantial disposal challenges. It is here that degradability becomes a crucial factor, dictating the lifecycle and environmental footprint of polymeric materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymers degrade through various chemical and physical processes, breaking down into simpler substances over time. Factors influencing this include intrinsic material properties, environmental conditions, and the presence of catalysts or microorganisms. Understanding these factors at a molecular level can not only enhance degradability but also lead to the design of novel materials tailored for specific end-of-life scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where atomistic calculations, an essential aspect of computational chemistry, play a pivotal role. Atomistic simulations involve computational techniques that model and predict the behavior of materials at the scale of atoms and molecules. They provide an unparalleled level of detail, allowing researchers to visualize and analyze the molecular dynamics and interactions within polymers. By employing atomistic calculations, scientists can predict how polymer structures will react under various conditions, paving the way for the creation of more sustainable and degradable materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the notable tools in this domain is PolymerModeler, an interactive platform available at nanoHUB.org. It facilitates the construction of polymer chains and the execution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the cloud. This system allows for accurate simulations of polymer properties such as transport phenomena, glass transition temperature, and mechanical response, which are crucial for assessing polymer performance and degradation (Haley et al., 2015).\n",

      "\n",
      "The visual representation below (an example graph) will help understand the various stages of polymer degradation via atomistic simulations:\n",
      "\n",
      "![Polymer Degradation Process](https://example.com/polymer_degradation_graph.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Graph Explanation:** The graph illustrates the energy minimization of a polymer chain during the degradation process. The y-axis represents the total system energy (in kcal/mol), while the x-axis denotes the minimization steps. Such graphical data help in visualizing the energy changes and stability of polymer structures during degradation, enabling a deeper analysis of degradation mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, integrating atomistic calculations into polymer degradability research provides a nuanced and detailed understanding of material behaviors at the atomic level.

      "Atomistic simulations are a powerful tool to predict materials properties and un- cover the fundamental mechanisms that govern them from first principles; these techniques are expected to play an increasingly important role in the design of new materials with tailored properties. [1, 2] Among many other contributions, molec- ular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided invaluable insight into the re- sponse of materials under extreme conditions[3, 4], size effects on plastic deform- ation[5], and polymer dynamics [6]. MD simulations are ubiquitous in science and engineering due, in part, to the continuing increase in computing power and the availability of efficient, parallel, and scalable codes that can make effective use of current supercomputers [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though some of these simulation codes, such as ESPResSo[12],\n",
      "\n",
      "GROMACS[13], and AMBER[14] are designed to simulate soft matter systems, the simulation of amorphous polymers remains challenging due to the difficulties involved in generating accurate molecular structures to be used as initial condi- tions in MD simulations. Unlike crystalline materials where initial atomic posi- tions can be easily generated by replicating a unit cell, or in atomic amorphous solids where equilibrated structures can be obtained from the melt [15, 16], the generation of amorphous thermoset or thermoplastic polymer structures requires special-purpose algorithms [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Chain dynamics in linear- chain polymers involve timescales well beyond those achievable with MD simu- lations, especially for large molecular-weight cases[24], and if the initial structure does not exhibit correct statistical properties the simulations will produce inaccu- rate results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some commercial software packages, such as MAPS by Scienomics and Ma- terials Studio by Accelrys, Inc, offer the capability to build atomistic structures of condensed-phase amorphous polymers using a simple GUI, pack the chains into a simulation volume, and perform MD simulations. Open source codes designed to build amorphous polymers include Polymatic [22, 23], MCCCS Towhee[25, 26],\n",
      "\n",
      "2\n",
      "\n",
      "PACKMOL[27], AMBER[14], and GROMACS[13]. These codes requires users to create input files in domain-specific mini-languages, in addition to compiling and running the program in order to pack chains in preparation for MD simula- tions. The ECCE[28] tool offers a GUI for building systems that may be simu- lated using ab initio packages such as Gaussian[29] but not with general purpose MD codes. Thus, we designed and developed PolymerModeler to provide a easy- to-use, general-purpose, freely accessible tool to build amorphous thermoplastic structures and perform MD simulations. We expect the tool to be useful both for education and in research: setting simulations up is simple enough to be used in the classroom, all that is required is an internet connection, yet, the code is pow- erful enough for research and can also be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art techniques to relax polymer structures and predict their properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PolymerModeler tool has been deployed on nanoHUB.org and is freely available for online simulations via the URL http://nanohub.org/resources/polymod. The only requirement is a nanoHUB account that can be obtained after a free reg- istration. nanoHUB [30] makes simulation tools accessible through a standard web browser or an iPad app, removing the need for users to download, configure, and install software and learn scripts or domain-specific languages. The state of a simulation is preserved even after closing the browser in which it is running or logging out of nanoHUB so that the user can return to the simulation later. Users can provide feedback and ask questions in nanoHUB.org. This information has guided the development of PolymerModeler, and we will continue listening to the desires of the user community for future development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PolymerModeler tool features a builder of amorphous, linear-chain ther- moplastic polymers, detailed in Section 2. As described in Section 3, the atomistic system constructed by the builder can be used as initial conditions for MD simu- lations using LAMMPS[31, 32] to compute thermo-mechanical properties of the polymer. All simulations run on nanoHUB computing resources including the possibility of running the MD in parallel over multiple processors. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n",

In PolymerModeler this last step is performed using the continuous configurational bias Monte Carlo algorithm [17]. The following subsections de- scribe these steps including details of the algorithms, approximations, and their implementation after which results of the builder are presented. Once the chains are built, PolymerModeler performs a series of relaxations to remove bad con- tacts and reduce entanglements after which molecular dynamics can be performed to predict thermo-mechanical properties; these relaxation and MD steps are de- scribed in Section 3.\n",

      "The first step in building amorphous thermoplastic polymers is specifying the re- peating unit which will be used to construct chains, and users can choose between a set of pre-built monomers or create/upload their own. The PolymerModeler tool accepts monomer specifications in the commonly used PDB (protein data bank) and XYZ file formats. Files of these types are available from a wide variety of online databases and may be uploaded directly to the PolymerModeler tool with no modification. The user must also specify which atom in the monomer is the head atom and which is the tail. The builder constructs a chain by adding one monomer unit at a time. Once a new monomer is added, the tail atom of the previous monomer on the chain is removed and so is the head atom of the new monomer. The final step is the creation of a bond between the backbone atoms originally attached to the head and tail atoms just removed. The head and tail atoms must each be connected to the molecule by a single bond.\n",

      "Internally the PolymerModeler tool converts a PDB or XYZ monomer to a z-matrix (internal coordinates format) representation that details the bonds, bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion (dihedral) angles between atoms. In this repre- sentation, the head atom is listed first, followed by all the backbone atoms to the tail, then all other atoms in the monomer. The PolymerModeler tool also accepts monomer specifications in this z-matrix format. The box describes the z-matrix format and shows an example for a PMMA monomer.\n",

From the second atom on, the second column of the z-matrix indicates the index of a previously defined atom to which the current atom (the atom specified by the current line) is bonded; the third column is then the bond length, in Angstroms, between these two atoms. For the third atom on, an angle needs to be specified to fully determine its internal position, so two additional columns are needed indicating a third atom (column four) and the corresponding bond angle, in degrees, is in the fifth column. For the remaining atoms a dihedral angle needs to be specified; the sixth column gives the index to a fourth atom required to specify a dihedral angle (defined between the plane determined by atoms on columns 6, 4 and 2 with that determined by atoms on columns 1, 2 and 4). The torsion angle between these planes is given, in degrees, in the final column. Pre-built z-matrix representations of several monomers are available in PolymerModeler.\n",

Multiple arrangements (patterns or probabilities) can be defined, with relative weights, to support the growth of multiple chain configurations in the same sys- tem. The builder chooses a pattern for each chain added to the system, according the the weights assigned to the patterns, and constructs the entire chain according to the selected pattern.

Chain conformations are governed by covalent interactions associ- ated with torsional angles along the backbone and by non-bond interactions that cause chains to avoid overlaps and for affine groups to tend to coalesce. These interactions cause chains to extend in good solvents and coil in bad solvents. In addition to the continuous configurational biased direct Monte Carlo algorithm PolymerModeler allows to build freely rotating chain polymers, rod-like poly- mers and chains built using self-avoiding walks for educational and verification purposes.\n",

      "Due to their high stiffness, bond lengths and angles are fixed at their equilib- rium values throughout the building procedure bond distances; this is commonly done in polymer builders. Thus, dihedral angles between backbone atoms (pi) are the only degrees of freedom considered during the initial structure creation. The first monomer is placed into the simulation cell at a random location (with uniform probability density) and with random orientation (with uniform angular distribution). Monomers are added sequentially with their torsion angles chosen according to the Boltzmann weight, i.e. the probability density of torsion i taking the angle o¡ is proportional to exp [-E (pi) /kT] where E (pi) is the energy of the of the corresponding configuration, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature. The energy associated with the configuration is obtained by adding van der Waals interactions and the covalent torsional energy as described in the following sub-sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PolymerModeler builder uses a Metropolis[33] Monte Carlo algorithm to explore and select torsion angle configurations. Initial angles are assigned ran- domly for all flexible torsions in the new monomer and a Metropolis Monte Carlo Markov chain is performed to determine the actual torsion angle values according to their Boltzmann weight. The Monte Carlo steps are as follows:\n",

      "Covalent energy of backbone torsion angles The PolymerModeler amorphous builder allows users to specify the covalent torsional potential in two ways.

      "Non-bond interactions. Non-bond interactions in the continuous configura- tional biased direct Monte Carlo play a key role avoiding bad contacts between atoms. PolymerModeler computes the non-bond energy as the sum of Lennard- Jones pair interactions between each atom in the tail monomer and all surround- ing atoms, using Dreiding parameters. As is customary in molecular force fields, atoms in the same chain separated by fewer than four bonds are excluded from these non-bond interactions. The cutoff number of bonds for non-bond interac- tions is a configurable parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computation of pair-wise interactions. A brute-force calculation of inter- atomic distance between the atoms of every new monomer with all previously built requires 1/2N(N -1) computations (N being the number of atoms) and becomes prohibitively expensive for relatively large systems. Thus, PolymerModeler uses the well-known domain decomposition approach to transform this computation into an O(N) calculation. The simulation cell volume is divided via a 3D grid with spacing AL, close to but larger than the cutoff distance for van der Waals interactions for the Monte Carlo algorithm. As new monomers are added into the system atoms are placed into their corresponding cell; this involves O(N) cal- culations. In order to compute inter-atomic distances to compute van der Waals energies or impose volume exclusions for an atom belonging to cell i only atoms in cell i and in its 26 nearest neighbors need to be checked. This calculations is independent of the simulation cell size for a given density and, thus, the algorithm is O(N).\n",

Scaled Dreiding Lennard-Jones parameters are used for this relax- ation. Each minimization scales both the energy and distance parameters. The use of scaled van der Waals interactions is motivated by the reduction in entangle- ments as chains can slide past one another as is done in state-of-the-art methods to relax amorphous polymers [19].

      "The molecular relaxation timescales of polymer melts (which increase with molec- ular weight as N3.4 for high molecular weight cases[45]) are prohibitively long for molecular dynamics simulations in most cases of interest. Thus the initial molecu- lar structure and its relaxation is critical for accurate MD simulations. [46, 44] The mean square displacement (MSD) between monomers as a function of their index in a polymer chain was found to be a useful descriptor of the polymer structure. Auhl et al. [44] showed that a simple relaxation of as-built polymer samples via energy minimization leads to unphysical molecular structure changes that relax over very long timescales and, consequently, affect predictions. These changes are reflected as significant deviations in the MSD for short and intermediate dis- tances. They found that a slow push-off approach, where intermolecular forces are turned on gradually, minimizes these problems and leads to well-equilibrated molecular structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "PolymerModeler allows multi-step relaxations where non-bond interactions are turned on gradually and we subjected our model to the same tests as in Ref. [44]. Figure 10 shows the mean square internal distances (MSD) between monomers for chains of polyethylene built using various algorithms, for comparison with Ref. [44]. As expected, building the chains using a naive, freely-rotating model without avoiding close contacts leads to the smallest mean square displacements; adding Lennard Jones interactions during build increases the MSD and using the configuration biased Monte Carlo approach including van der Waals interactions and the torsional barriers caused by covalent terms leads to an even higher MSD and a more accurate structure. For this last cases, the system was built with sp3 torsional potential from Dreiding (Equation 13 in reference [38]) and Lennard- Jones interactions between all atoms to a cutoff of 6Å. The as-built structure was then relaxed in a gradual, 10-step, procedure where van der Waals interactions are turned on slowly. At each step we performed 500 conjugate gradient steps and 500 molecular dynamics steps at a temperature T=600 K. The properties of the resulting structure are shown as dashed lines in Fig. 10. Finally, we performed an additional thermalization with MD for 50,000 steps under isothermal, isochoric conditions at 600 K. The MSD of the structure after the MD simulations is shown as a solid line in Fig. 10. Consistent with the findings by Auhl et al. we find that\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",

      "a gradual relaxation procedure results in structures that maintain their statistical properties during relaxation and dynamics. Such structures produced by the Poly- merModeler builder with sp3 torsions and Lennard-Jones interactions followed by a gradual introduction of non-bond interactions are expected to be good starting points for MD simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the MSD, the radial distribution function g(r) for chains con- structed by PolymerModeler demonstrates good equilibration and good agreement with neutron diffraction experiments. Figure 11 shows the radial distribution func- tion, g(r), for backbone carbon atoms in 100 isotactic PMMA chains built at 0.6 g/cm3, fully relaxed with the 10 steps of minimization, after 400 ps of MD at 600K. The peaks corresponding to nearest neighbor distances are labeled. In- dicators at 4.8Å and 8.6Å are included in figure 11 for comparison with Figure 7(a) in Ref. [47], which shows a similar g(r) calculation for the backbone atoms of syndiotactic PMMA. The indicators correspond to intrachain peaks (4.8Å) and in- terchain peaks (8.6Å) identified in PMMA by neutron scattering data. Structures built and equilibrated by PolymerModeler compare well to these results.\n",

In order to compute Tg the relaxed structure is cooled down to room temperature under constant pressure conditions. We control the temperature and pressure of the system using Nosé-Hoover thermostat and barostat with coupling timescales of 0.1 ps and 1 ps respectively. The system is cooled down in continuous increments at a rate of 0.1 K/ps. These simulations take approximately 70 hours when run using 24 cores.\n",

The well-known cases of freely rotating and self-avoiding chains are accurately re- produced by the builder. Structural properties of systems built by the Polymer- Modeler builder compare well with systems built by commercial packages and current state-of-the-art techniques.\n",

      "# Introduction to Polymer Degradability and Atomistic Calculations\n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome to our comprehensive exploration into the cutting-edge field of polymer degradability enhanced by atomistic calculations. The increasing environmental awareness and demand for sustainable materials have thrust the research on polymer degradation into the limelight. Polymers, being versatile and ubiquitous, contribute significantly to our modern lifestyle, but their longevity poses substantial disposal challenges. It is here that degradability becomes a crucial factor, dictating the lifecycle and environmental footprint of polymeric materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymers degrade through various chemical and physical processes, breaking down into simpler substances over time. Factors influencing this include intrinsic material properties, environmental conditions, and the presence of catalysts or microorganisms. Understanding these factors at a molecular level can not only enhance degradability but also lead to the design of novel materials tailored for specific end-of-life scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where atomistic calculations, an essential aspect of computational chemistry, play a pivotal role. Atomistic simulations involve computational techniques that model and predict the behavior of materials at the scale of atoms and molecules. They provide an unparalleled level of detail, allowing researchers to visualize and analyze the molecular dynamics and interactions within polymers. By employing atomistic calculations, scientists can predict how polymer structures will react under various conditions, paving the way for the creation of more sustainable and degradable materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the notable tools in this domain is PolymerModeler, an interactive platform available at nanoHUB.org. It facilitates the construction of polymer chains and the execution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the cloud. This system allows for accurate simulations of polymer properties such as glass transition temperature and mechanical response, which are crucial for assessing polymer performance and degradation (Haley et al., 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Blog Roadmap\n",

      "\n",
      "The visual representation below (an example graph) will help understand the various stages of polymer degradation via atomistic simulations:\n",
      "\n",
      "![Polymer Degradation Process](https://example.com/polymer_degradation_graph.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Graph Explanation:** The graph illustrates the energy minimization of a polymer chain during the degradation process. The y-axis represents the total system energy (in kcal/mol), while the x-axis denotes the minimization steps. Such graphical data help in visualizing the energy changes and stability of polymer structures during degradation, enabling a deeper analysis of degradation mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, integrating atomistic calculations into polymer degradability research provides a nuanced and detailed understanding of material behaviors at the atomic level.

      "Atomistic simulations are a powerful tool to predict materials properties and un- cover the fundamental mechanisms that govern them from first principles; these techniques are expected to play an increasingly important role in the design of new materials with tailored properties. [1, 2] Among many other contributions, molec- ular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided invaluable insight into the re- sponse of materials under extreme conditions[3, 4], size effects on plastic deform- ation[5], and polymer dynamics [6]. MD simulations are ubiquitous in science and engineering due, in part, to the continuing increase in computing power and the availability of efficient, parallel, and scalable codes that can make effective use of current supercomputers [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though some of these simulation codes, such as ESPResSo[12],\n",
      "\n",
      "GROMACS[13], and AMBER[14] are designed to simulate soft matter systems, the simulation of amorphous polymers remains challenging due to the difficulties involved in generating accurate molecular structures to be used as initial condi- tions in MD simulations. Unlike crystalline materials where initial atomic posi- tions can be easily generated by replicating a unit cell, or in atomic amorphous solids where equilibrated structures can be obtained from the melt [15, 16], the generation of amorphous thermoset or thermoplastic polymer structures requires special-purpose algorithms [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Chain dynamics in linear- chain polymers involve timescales well beyond those achievable with MD simu- lations, especially for large molecular-weight cases[24], and if the initial structure does not exhibit correct statistical properties the simulations will produce inaccu- rate results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some commercial software packages, such as MAPS by Scienomics and Ma- terials Studio by Accelrys, Inc, offer the capability to build atomistic structures of condensed-phase amorphous polymers using a simple GUI, pack the chains into a simulation volume, and perform MD simulations. Open source codes designed to build amorphous polymers include Polymatic [22, 23], MCCCS Towhee[25, 26],\n",
      "\n",
      "2\n",
      "\n",
      "PACKMOL[27], AMBER[14], and GROMACS[13]. These codes requires users to create input files in domain-specific mini-languages, in addition to compiling and running the program in order to pack chains in preparation for MD simula- tions. The ECCE[28] tool offers a GUI for building systems that may be simu- lated using ab initio packages such as Gaussian[29] but not with general purpose MD codes. Thus, we designed and developed PolymerModeler to provide a easy- to-use, general-purpose, freely accessible tool to build amorphous thermoplastic structures and perform MD simulations. We expect the tool to be useful both for education and in research: setting simulations up is simple enough to be used in the classroom, all that is required is an internet connection, yet, the code is pow- erful enough for research and can also be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art techniques to relax polymer structures and predict their properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PolymerModeler tool has been deployed on nanoHUB.org and is freely available for online simulations via the URL http://nanohub.org/resources/polymod. The only requirement is a nanoHUB account that can be obtained after a free reg- istration. nanoHUB [30] makes simulation tools accessible through a standard web browser or an iPad app, removing the need for users to download, configure, and install software and learn scripts or domain-specific languages. The state of a simulation is preserved even after closing the browser in which it is running or logging out of nanoHUB so that the user can return to the simulation later. Users can provide feedback and ask questions in nanoHUB.org. This information has guided the development of PolymerModeler, and we will continue listening to the desires of the user community for future development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PolymerModeler tool features a builder of amorphous, linear-chain ther- moplastic polymers, detailed in Section 2. As described in Section 3, the atomistic system constructed by the builder can be used as initial conditions for MD simu- lations using LAMMPS[31, 32] to compute thermo-mechanical properties of the polymer. All simulations run on nanoHUB computing resources including the possibility of running the MD in parallel over multiple processors. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n",

      "The process of building a condensed-phase, amorphous, linear-chain polymer in PolymerModeler can be divided in three main steps: i) the specification of one or multiple monomers and their statistical arrangement into chains, including the chain length and number of chains to pack in the simulation cell, ii) the deter-\n",

      "\n",
      "mination of the simulation cell into which the chains will be placed; and iii) the specification of rules for the sequential placement of monomers into chains of the desired length with conformation given by a set of dihedral angles between monomers. In PolymerModeler this last step is performed using the continuous configurational bias Monte Carlo algorithm [17]. The following subsections de- scribe these steps including details of the algorithms, approximations, and their implementation after which results of the builder are presented. Once the chains are built, PolymerModeler performs a series of relaxations to remove bad con- tacts and reduce entanglements after which molecular dynamics can be performed to predict thermo-mechanical properties; these relaxation and MD steps are de- scribed in Section 3.\n",

      "The first step in building amorphous thermoplastic polymers is specifying the re- peating unit which will be used to construct chains, and users can choose between a set of pre-built monomers or create/upload their own. The PolymerModeler tool accepts monomer specifications in the commonly used PDB (protein data bank) and XYZ file formats. Files of these types are available from a wide variety of online databases and may be uploaded directly to the PolymerModeler tool with no modification. The user must also specify which atom in the monomer is the head atom and which is the tail. The builder constructs a chain by adding one monomer unit at a time. Once a new monomer is added, the tail atom of the previous monomer on the chain is removed and so is the head atom of the new monomer. The final step is the creation of a bond between the backbone atoms originally attached to the head and tail atoms just removed. The head and tail atoms must each be connected to the molecule by a single bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Internally the PolymerModeler tool converts a PDB or XYZ monomer to a z-matrix (internal coordinates format) representation that details the bonds, bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion (dihedral) angles between atoms. In this repre- sentation, the head atom is listed first, followed by all the backbone atoms to the tail, then all other atoms in the monomer. The PolymerModeler tool also accepts monomer specifications in this z-matrix format. The box describes the z-matrix format and shows an example for a PMMA monomer.\n",

      "The first line specifies the number of backbone atoms in the monomer, which are the leading entries in the z-matrix. The first column of the z-matrix gives information about atomic species in terms of Dreiding atomic types (discussed in the following paragraph). From the second atom on, the second column of the z-matrix indicates the index of a previously defined atom to which the current atom (the atom specified by the current line) is bonded; the third column is then the bond length, in Angstroms, between these two atoms. For the third atom on, an angle needs to be specified to fully determine its internal position, so two additional columns are needed indicating a third atom (column four) and the corresponding bond angle, in degrees, is in the fifth column. For the remaining atoms a dihedral angle needs to be specified; the sixth column gives the index to a fourth atom required to specify a dihedral angle (defined between the plane determined by atoms on columns 6, 4 and 2 with that determined by atoms on columns 1, 2 and 4). The torsion angle between these planes is given, in degrees, in the final column. Pre-built z-matrix representations of several monomers are available in PolymerModeler.\n",

A pattern arrangement specifies an order in which monomers are added to a chain, repeating until the desired chain length is reached. A probability arrangement assigns relative weights to the defined monomers, which are stochastically added to a chain according to these weights. Multiple arrangements (patterns or probabilities) can be defined, with relative weights, to support the growth of multiple chain configurations in the same sys- tem. The builder chooses a pattern for each chain added to the system, according the the weights assigned to the patterns, and constructs the entire chain according to the selected pattern. In this manner the builder allows the full specification of stereochemistry. The supplementary material provides examples of how these fea- tures can be used to create isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic PMMA structures.\n",

Chain conformations are governed by covalent interactions associ- ated with torsional angles along the backbone and by non-bond interactions that cause chains to avoid overlaps and for affine groups to tend to coalesce. These interactions cause chains to extend in good solvents and coil in bad solvents. In addition to the continuous configurational biased direct Monte Carlo algorithm PolymerModeler allows to build freely rotating chain polymers, rod-like poly- mers and chains built using self-avoiding walks for educational and verification purposes.\n",

      "Due to their high stiffness, bond lengths and angles are fixed at their equilib- rium values throughout the building procedure bond distances; this is commonly done in polymer builders. Thus, dihedral angles between backbone atoms (pi) are the only degrees of freedom considered during the initial structure creation. The first monomer is placed into the simulation cell at a random location (with uniform probability density) and with random orientation (with uniform angular distribution). Monomers are added sequentially with their torsion angles chosen according to the Boltzmann weight, i.e. the probability density of torsion i taking the angle o¡ is proportional to exp [-E (pi) /kT] where E (pi) is the energy of the of the corresponding configuration, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature. The energy associated with the configuration is obtained by adding van der Waals interactions and the covalent torsional energy as described in the following sub-sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PolymerModeler builder uses a Metropolis[33] Monte Carlo algorithm to explore and select torsion angle configurations. Initial angles are assigned ran- domly for all flexible torsions in the new monomer and a Metropolis Monte Carlo Markov chain is performed to determine the actual torsion angle values according to their Boltzmann weight. The Monte Carlo steps are as follows:\n",

      "Covalent energy of backbone torsion angles The PolymerModeler amorphous builder allows users to specify the covalent torsional potential in two ways.

      "Non-bond interactions. Non-bond interactions in the continuous configura- tional biased direct Monte Carlo play a key role avoiding bad contacts between atoms. PolymerModeler computes the non-bond energy as the sum of Lennard- Jones pair interactions between each atom in the tail monomer and all surround- ing atoms, using Dreiding parameters. As is customary in molecular force fields, atoms in the same chain separated by fewer than four bonds are excluded from these non-bond interactions. The cutoff number of bonds for non-bond interac- tions is a configurable parameter.\n",

      "Computation of pair-wise interactions. A brute-force calculation of inter- atomic distance between the atoms of every new monomer with all previously built requires 1/2N(N -1) computations (N being the number of atoms) and becomes prohibitively expensive for relatively large systems. Thus, PolymerModeler uses the well-known domain decomposition approach to transform this computation into an O(N) calculation. The simulation cell volume is divided via a 3D grid with spacing AL, close to but larger than the cutoff distance for van der Waals interactions for the Monte Carlo algorithm. As new monomers are added into the system atoms are placed into their corresponding cell; this involves O(N) cal- culations. In order to compute inter-atomic distances to compute van der Waals energies or impose volume exclusions for an atom belonging to cell i only atoms in cell i and in its 26 nearest neighbors need to be checked. This calculations is independent of the simulation cell size for a given density and, thus, the algorithm is O(N).\n",

Scaled Dreiding Lennard-Jones parameters are used for this relax- ation. Each minimization scales both the energy and distance parameters. The use of scaled van der Waals interactions is motivated by the reduction in entangle- ments as chains can slide past one another as is done in state-of-the-art methods to relax amorphous polymers [19].

      "The molecular relaxation timescales of polymer melts (which increase with molec- ular weight as N3.4 for high molecular weight cases[45]) are prohibitively long for molecular dynamics simulations in most cases of interest. Thus the initial molecu- lar structure and its relaxation is critical for accurate MD simulations. [46, 44] The mean square displacement (MSD) between monomers as a function of their index in a polymer chain was found to be a useful descriptor of the polymer structure. Auhl et al. [44] showed that a simple relaxation of as-built polymer samples via energy minimization leads to unphysical molecular structure changes that relax over very long timescales and, consequently, affect predictions. These changes are reflected as significant deviations in the MSD for short and intermediate dis- tances. They found that a slow push-off approach, where intermolecular forces are turned on gradually, minimizes these problems and leads to well-equilibrated molecular structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "PolymerModeler allows multi-step relaxations where non-bond interactions are turned on gradually and we subjected our model to the same tests as in Ref. [44]. Figure 10 shows the mean square internal distances (MSD) between monomers for chains of polyethylene built using various algorithms, for comparison with Ref. [44]. As expected, building the chains using a naive, freely-rotating model without avoiding close contacts leads to the smallest mean square displacements; adding Lennard Jones interactions during build increases the MSD and using the configuration biased Monte Carlo approach including van der Waals interactions and the torsional barriers caused by covalent terms leads to an even higher MSD and a more accurate structure. For this last cases, the system was built with sp3 torsional potential from Dreiding (Equation 13 in reference [38]) and Lennard- Jones interactions between all atoms to a cutoff of 6Å. The as-built structure was then relaxed in a gradual, 10-step, procedure where van der Waals interactions are turned on slowly. At each step we performed 500 conjugate gradient steps and 500 molecular dynamics steps at a temperature T=600 K. The properties of the resulting structure are shown as dashed lines in Fig. 10. Finally, we performed an additional thermalization with MD for 50,000 steps under isothermal, isochoric conditions at 600 K. The MSD of the structure after the MD simulations is shown as a solid line in Fig. 10. Consistent with the findings by Auhl et al. we find that\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",
      "\n",
      "a gradual relaxation procedure results in structures that maintain their statistical properties during relaxation and dynamics. Such structures produced by the Poly- merModeler builder with sp3 torsions and Lennard-Jones interactions followed by a gradual introduction of non-bond interactions are expected to be good starting points for MD simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the MSD, the radial distribution function g(r) for chains con- structed by PolymerModeler demonstrates good equilibration and good agreement with neutron diffraction experiments. Figure 11 shows the radial distribution func- tion, g(r), for backbone carbon atoms in 100 isotactic PMMA chains built at 0.6 g/cm3, fully relaxed with the 10 steps of minimization, after 400 ps of MD at 600K. The peaks corresponding to nearest neighbor distances are labeled. In- dicators at 4.8Å and 8.6Å are included in figure 11 for comparison with Figure 7(a) in Ref. [47], which shows a similar g(r) calculation for the backbone atoms of syndiotactic PMMA. The indicators correspond to intrachain peaks (4.8Å) and in- terchain peaks (8.6Å) identified in PMMA by neutron scattering data. Structures built and equilibrated by PolymerModeler compare well to these results.\n",

The simulation cell contains 40 chains, each 90-monomers long, for a total of 54,080 atoms. The structure is then relaxed using a 3 phase minimization and thermalized for 100 ps under NPT conditions at 600 K. In order to compute Tg the relaxed structure is cooled down to room temperature under constant pressure conditions. We control the temperature and pressure of the system using Nosé-Hoover thermostat and barostat with coupling timescales of 0.1 ps and 1 ps respectively. The system is cooled down in continuous increments at a rate of 0.1 K/ps. These simulations take approximately 70 hours when run using 24 cores.\n",

      "## Application of Atomistic Calculations in Polymer Science\n",
      "\n",
      "Atomistic calculations have increasingly become a fundamental tool in polymer science for predicting and studying polymer properties at an atomic level. These simulations enable researchers to model polymer structures, predict their behaviors, and study various mechanisms such as degradability. This section delves into the practical use of atomistic calculations, leveraging case studies and detailed methodologies, while also highlighting experimental validations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Case Studies\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Case Study 1: Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)\n",
      "Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is an amorphous polymer widely used in applications ranging from optical devices to prosthetics. A significant study leveraged the capabilities of PolymerModeler on nanoHUB.org to perform atomistic simulations on PMMA. The study used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the structural properties of PMMA, such as the glass transition temperature (Tg) and mechanical response. The sequential addition of monomers using a continuous configurational bias Monte Carlo method enabled the creation of polymer chains with realistic configurations. These simulations showed good structural agreement with experimental data, highlighting the utility of atomistic calculations in validating polymer properties (Haley et al., 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Case Study 2: Vitrimer Polymers\n",
      "Another compelling example involves vitrimers, a class of polymers known for their recyclability due to dynamic covalent networks. A recent study integrated atomistic calculations with machine learning to design novel vitrimer chemistries with targeted Tg. By generating a vitrimer dataset of over one million chemistries and performing high-throughput MD simulations, researchers were able to predict Tg values effectively. Experimental synthesis of a novel vitrimer polymer guided by these predictions confirmed the accuracy of the Tg values, showcasing the power of atomistic calculations in advancing sustainable polymer design (Zheng et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodologies\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Molecular Dynamics Simulations\n",
      "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations form the backbone of atomistic calculations in polymer science. These simulations entail constructing a polymer chain at the desired density, relaxing the structure using scaled-down van der Waals interactions to remove close contacts, and employing various ensembles (NVT, NPT, NVE) to simulate different thermodynamic conditions. Parameters like time step, number of steps, and temperature can be configured to tailor simulations to specific studies. \n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, in the simulation of PMMA, configurations were generated using Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling, considering van der Waals interactions to produce self-avoiding chains. The structural relaxation phase involved adjusting interactions and conformations to minimize energy, followed by MD simulations to predict properties such as glass transition temperature and mechanical response (Haley et al., 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Experimental Validation\n",
      "\n",
      "To bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and practical applications, experimental validation is crucial. In the vitrimer study, high-throughput MD simulations predicted the Tg of various polymer chemistries, which were then synthesized and tested experimentally. The vitrimer with a predicted Tg of 323 K was synthesized and exhibited a Tg of 311-317 K in laboratory conditions, underscoring the reliability of atomistic predictions. The vitrimer's ability to heal and flow as predicted further validated the approach (Zheng et al., 2023).\n",

      "\n",
      "![Polymer Glass Transition Temperature Prediction](https://example.com/path-to-graph.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "_The graph shows the predicted Tg values from high-throughput MD simulations against the experimentally measured Tg values for synthesized vitrimers._\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Atomistic calculations offer a powerful toolset for polymer scientists, facilitating detailed prediction and analysis of polymer properties. Through case studies on PMMA and vitrimers, and the robust methodologies employed in MD simulations, the practical applications of these calculations are clear. Experimental validation further cements their utility, making atomistic calculations indispensable for advancing polymer science.\n",

      "Atomistic simulations are a powerful tool to predict materials properties and un- cover the fundamental mechanisms that govern them from first principles; these techniques are expected to play an increasingly important role in the design of new materials with tailored properties. [1, 2] Among many other contributions, molec- ular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided invaluable insight into the re- sponse of materials under extreme conditions[3, 4], size effects on plastic deform- ation[5], and polymer dynamics [6]. MD simulations are ubiquitous in science and engineering due, in part, to the continuing increase in computing power and the availability of efficient, parallel, and scalable codes that can make effective use of current supercomputers [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though some of these simulation codes, such as ESPResSo[12],\n",
      "\n",
      "GROMACS[13], and AMBER[14] are designed to simulate soft matter systems, the simulation of amorphous polymers remains challenging due to the difficulties involved in generating accurate molecular structures to be used as initial condi- tions in MD simulations. Unlike crystalline materials where initial atomic posi- tions can be easily generated by replicating a unit cell, or in atomic amorphous solids where equilibrated structures can be obtained from the melt [15, 16], the generation of amorphous thermoset or thermoplastic polymer structures requires special-purpose algorithms [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Chain dynamics in linear- chain polymers involve timescales well beyond those achievable with MD simu- lations, especially for large molecular-weight cases[24], and if the initial structure does not exhibit correct statistical properties the simulations will produce inaccu- rate results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some commercial software packages, such as MAPS by Scienomics and Ma- terials Studio by Accelrys, Inc, offer the capability to build atomistic structures of condensed-phase amorphous polymers using a simple GUI, pack the chains into a simulation volume, and perform MD simulations. Open source codes designed to build amorphous polymers include Polymatic [22, 23], MCCCS Towhee[25, 26],\n",

      "PACKMOL[27], AMBER[14], and GROMACS[13]. These codes requires users to create input files in domain-specific mini-languages, in addition to compiling and running the program in order to pack chains in preparation for MD simula- tions. The ECCE[28] tool offers a GUI for building systems that may be simu- lated using ab initio packages such as Gaussian[29] but not with general purpose MD codes. Thus, we designed and developed PolymerModeler to provide a easy- to-use, general-purpose, freely accessible tool to build amorphous thermoplastic structures and perform MD simulations. We expect the tool to be useful both for education and in research: setting simulations up is simple enough to be used in the classroom, all that is required is an internet connection, yet, the code is pow- erful enough for research and can also be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art techniques to relax polymer structures and predict their properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PolymerModeler tool has been deployed on nanoHUB.org and is freely available for online simulations via the URL http://nanohub.org/resources/polymod. The only requirement is a nanoHUB account that can be obtained after a free reg- istration. nanoHUB [30] makes simulation tools accessible through a standard web browser or an iPad app, removing the need for users to download, configure, and install software and learn scripts or domain-specific languages. The state of a simulation is preserved even after closing the browser in which it is running or logging out of nanoHUB so that the user can return to the simulation later. Users can provide feedback and ask questions in nanoHUB.org. This information has guided the development of PolymerModeler, and we will continue listening to the desires of the user community for future development.\n",

      "The PolymerModeler tool features a builder of amorphous, linear-chain ther- moplastic polymers, detailed in Section 2. As described in Section 3, the atomistic system constructed by the builder can be used as initial conditions for MD simu- lations using LAMMPS[31, 32] to compute thermo-mechanical properties of the polymer. All simulations run on nanoHUB computing resources including the possibility of running the MD in parallel over multiple processors. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n",

      "The process of building a condensed-phase, amorphous, linear-chain polymer in PolymerModeler can be divided in three main steps: i) the specification of one or multiple monomers and their statistical arrangement into chains, including the chain length and number of chains to pack in the simulation cell, ii) the deter-\n",

      "\n",
      "mination of the simulation cell into which the chains will be placed; and iii) the specification of rules for the sequential placement of monomers into chains of the desired length with conformation given by a set of dihedral angles between monomers. In PolymerModeler this last step is performed using the continuous configurational bias Monte Carlo algorithm [17]. The following subsections de- scribe these steps including details of the algorithms, approximations, and their implementation after which results of the builder are presented. Once the chains are built, PolymerModeler performs a series of relaxations to remove bad con- tacts and reduce entanglements after which molecular dynamics can be performed to predict thermo-mechanical properties; these relaxation and MD steps are de- scribed in Section 3.\n",

      "The first step in building amorphous thermoplastic polymers is specifying the re- peating unit which will be used to construct chains, and users can choose between a set of pre-built monomers or create/upload their own. The PolymerModeler tool accepts monomer specifications in the commonly used PDB (protein data bank) and XYZ file formats. Files of these types are available from a wide variety of online databases and may be uploaded directly to the PolymerModeler tool with no modification. The user must also specify which atom in the monomer is the head atom and which is the tail. The builder constructs a chain by adding one monomer unit at a time. Once a new monomer is added, the tail atom of the previous monomer on the chain is removed and so is the head atom of the new monomer. The final step is the creation of a bond between the backbone atoms originally attached to the head and tail atoms just removed. The head and tail atoms must each be connected to the molecule by a single bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Internally the PolymerModeler tool converts a PDB or XYZ monomer to a z-matrix (internal coordinates format) representation that details the bonds, bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion (dihedral) angles between atoms. In this repre- sentation, the head atom is listed first, followed by all the backbone atoms to the tail, then all other atoms in the monomer. The PolymerModeler tool also accepts monomer specifications in this z-matrix format. The box describes the z-matrix format and shows an example for a PMMA monomer.\n",

The first column of the z-matrix gives information about atomic species in terms of Dreiding atomic types (discussed in the following paragraph). From the second atom on, the second column of the z-matrix indicates the index of a previously defined atom to which the current atom (the atom specified by the current line) is bonded; the third column is then the bond length, in Angstroms, between these two atoms. For the third atom on, an angle needs to be specified to fully determine its internal position, so two additional columns are needed indicating a third atom (column four) and the corresponding bond angle, in degrees, is in the fifth column. For the remaining atoms a dihedral angle needs to be specified; the sixth column gives the index to a fourth atom required to specify a dihedral angle (defined between the plane determined by atoms on columns 6, 4 and 2 with that determined by atoms on columns 1, 2 and 4). The torsion angle between these planes is given, in degrees, in the final column. Pre-built z-matrix representations of several monomers are available in PolymerModeler.\n",

A probability arrangement assigns relative weights to the defined monomers, which are stochastically added to a chain according to these weights. Multiple arrangements (patterns or probabilities) can be defined, with relative weights, to support the growth of multiple chain configurations in the same sys- tem. The builder chooses a pattern for each chain added to the system, according the the weights assigned to the patterns, and constructs the entire chain according to the selected pattern. In this manner the builder allows the full specification of stereochemistry. The supplementary material provides examples of how these fea- tures can be used to create isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic PMMA structures.\n",

      "The principal polymer builder algorithm supported by PolymerModeler is the con- tinuous configurational biased direct Monte Carlo[17] that efficiently samples tor- sions along the polymer backbone and leads to structures with reasonable statis- tical weights. Chain conformations are governed by covalent interactions associ- ated with torsional angles along the backbone and by non-bond interactions that cause chains to avoid overlaps and for affine groups to tend to coalesce. These interactions cause chains to extend in good solvents and coil in bad solvents. In addition to the continuous configurational biased direct Monte Carlo algorithm PolymerModeler allows to build freely rotating chain polymers, rod-like poly- mers and chains built using self-avoiding walks for educational and verification purposes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Due to their high stiffness, bond lengths and angles are fixed at their equilib- rium values throughout the building procedure bond distances; this is commonly done in polymer builders. Thus, dihedral angles between backbone atoms (pi) are the only degrees of freedom considered during the initial structure creation. The first monomer is placed into the simulation cell at a random location (with uniform probability density) and with random orientation (with uniform angular distribution). Monomers are added sequentially with their torsion angles chosen according to the Boltzmann weight, i.e. the probability density of torsion i taking the angle o¡ is proportional to exp [-E (pi) /kT] where E (pi) is the energy of the of the corresponding configuration, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature. The energy associated with the configuration is obtained by adding van der Waals interactions and the covalent torsional energy as described in the following sub-sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PolymerModeler builder uses a Metropolis[33] Monte Carlo algorithm to explore and select torsion angle configurations. Initial angles are assigned ran- domly for all flexible torsions in the new monomer and a Metropolis Monte Carlo Markov chain is performed to determine the actual torsion angle values according to their Boltzmann weight. The Monte Carlo steps are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "· A new trial configuration (torsion angles for all flexible dihedrals of the current monomer) is chosen by an unbiased, random modification of the current state,\n",
      "\n",
      ". The change in energy, AE, associated with the trial move is computed from the van der Waals interactions and covalent torsion terms (if specified);\n",
      "\n",
      "· The new configuration is accepted with probability one if AE < 0 (i.e. the AE trial move decreases the energy of the system) and with probability e kBT otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "This process is repeated for a user-specified number of steps, and the final angles are used to place the monomer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Covalent energy of backbone torsion angles The PolymerModeler amorphous builder allows users to specify the covalent torsional potential in two ways. The torsional energy as a function of angle can be provided numerically. Sample tor- sion potentials for sp2 and sp3 bonds according to the Dreiding force field are included in the tool. Alternatively, users can specify a probability as a function\n",

      "of torsion angle; these probabilities are then converted into relative energies using Boltzmann weights. Energies for arbitrary atoms are obtained by interpolating between the tabular data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-bond interactions. Non-bond interactions in the continuous configura- tional biased direct Monte Carlo play a key role avoiding bad contacts between atoms. PolymerModeler computes the non-bond energy as the sum of Lennard- Jones pair interactions between each atom in the tail monomer and all surround- ing atoms, using Dreiding parameters. As is customary in molecular force fields, atoms in the same chain separated by fewer than four bonds are excluded from these non-bond interactions. The cutoff number of bonds for non-bond interac- tions is a configurable parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computation of pair-wise interactions. A brute-force calculation of inter- atomic distance between the atoms of every new monomer with all previously built requires 1/2N(N -1) computations (N being the number of atoms) and becomes prohibitively expensive for relatively large systems. Thus, PolymerModeler uses the well-known domain decomposition approach to transform this computation into an O(N) calculation. The simulation cell volume is divided via a 3D grid with spacing AL, close to but larger than the cutoff distance for van der Waals interactions for the Monte Carlo algorithm. As new monomers are added into the system atoms are placed into their corresponding cell; this involves O(N) cal- culations. In order to compute inter-atomic distances to compute van der Waals energies or impose volume exclusions for an atom belonging to cell i only atoms in cell i and in its 26 nearest neighbors need to be checked. This calculations is independent of the simulation cell size for a given density and, thus, the algorithm is O(N).\n",

The third character denotes hybridization or local bonding (2 means sp2, 3 means sp3, and R denotes resonance) and the fourth is used for atoms with implicit hydrogens.

The parameters de- scribing torsion interactions in Dreiding depend on the hybridization of the central two atoms and the nature of these atoms is used to setup the energy expressions. Exceptions to this rule involve some torsions where the third atom is not an sp2 center and in those cases the force field types of three atoms are used.

Scaled Dreiding Lennard-Jones parameters are used for this relax- ation. Each minimization scales both the energy and distance parameters. The use of scaled van der Waals interactions is motivated by the reduction in entangle- ments as chains can slide past one another as is done in state-of-the-art methods to relax amorphous polymers [19].

Thus the initial molecu- lar structure and its relaxation is critical for accurate MD simulations. [46, 44] The mean square displacement (MSD) between monomers as a function of their index in a polymer chain was found to be a useful descriptor of the polymer structure. Auhl et al. [44] showed that a simple relaxation of as-built polymer samples via energy minimization leads to unphysical molecular structure changes that relax over very long timescales and, consequently, affect predictions. These changes are reflected as significant deviations in the MSD for short and intermediate dis- tances. They found that a slow push-off approach, where intermolecular forces are turned on gradually, minimizes these problems and leads to well-equilibrated molecular structures.\n",

      "PolymerModeler allows multi-step relaxations where non-bond interactions are turned on gradually and we subjected our model to the same tests as in Ref. [44]. Figure 10 shows the mean square internal distances (MSD) between monomers for chains of polyethylene built using various algorithms, for comparison with Ref. [44]. As expected, building the chains using a naive, freely-rotating model without avoiding close contacts leads to the smallest mean square displacements; adding Lennard Jones interactions during build increases the MSD and using the configuration biased Monte Carlo approach including van der Waals interactions and the torsional barriers caused by covalent terms leads to an even higher MSD and a more accurate structure. For this last cases, the system was built with sp3 torsional potential from Dreiding (Equation 13 in reference [38]) and Lennard- Jones interactions between all atoms to a cutoff of 6Å. The as-built structure was then relaxed in a gradual, 10-step, procedure where van der Waals interactions are turned on slowly. At each step we performed 500 conjugate gradient steps and 500 molecular dynamics steps at a temperature T=600 K. The properties of the resulting structure are shown as dashed lines in Fig. 10. Finally, we performed an additional thermalization with MD for 50,000 steps under isothermal, isochoric conditions at 600 K. The MSD of the structure after the MD simulations is shown as a solid line in Fig. 10. Consistent with the findings by Auhl et al. we find that\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",
      "\n",
      "a gradual relaxation procedure results in structures that maintain their statistical properties during relaxation and dynamics. Such structures produced by the Poly- merModeler builder with sp3 torsions and Lennard-Jones interactions followed by a gradual introduction of non-bond interactions are expected to be good starting points for MD simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the MSD, the radial distribution function g(r) for chains con- structed by PolymerModeler demonstrates good equilibration and good agreement with neutron diffraction experiments. Figure 11 shows the radial distribution func- tion, g(r), for backbone carbon atoms in 100 isotactic PMMA chains built at 0.6 g/cm3, fully relaxed with the 10 steps of minimization, after 400 ps of MD at 600K. The peaks corresponding to nearest neighbor distances are labeled. In- dicators at 4.8Å and 8.6Å are included in figure 11 for comparison with Figure 7(a) in Ref. [47], which shows a similar g(r) calculation for the backbone atoms of syndiotactic PMMA. The indicators correspond to intrachain peaks (4.8Å) and in- terchain peaks (8.6Å) identified in PMMA by neutron scattering data. Structures built and equilibrated by PolymerModeler compare well to these results.\n",
      "\n",
      "We encourage PolymerModeler users to perform similar tests of their struc- tures before production runs. We also note that the structures generated can used as starting points for advanced parallel-replica type approaches specifically de- signed to equilibrate long-chain amorphous structures [19].\n",

The simulation cell contains 40 chains, each 90-monomers long, for a total of 54,080 atoms. The structure is then relaxed using a 3 phase minimization and thermalized for 100 ps under NPT conditions at 600 K. In order to compute Tg the relaxed structure is cooled down to room temperature under constant pressure conditions. We control the temperature and pressure of the system using Nosé-Hoover thermostat and barostat with coupling timescales of 0.1 ps and 1 ps respectively. The system is cooled down in continuous increments at a rate of 0.1 K/ps. These simulations take approximately 70 hours when run using 24 cores.\n",

More importantly for our study is the change is slope that can be observed around 420 K. This denotes the glass transition where the system transforms from a melt to a glassy solid. The molten state above Tg has a higher thermal expansion coefficient that the solid below it. The predicted value of Tg is in good agreement with experimental values 388 K[48] and 385 K[49]. When comparing MD and experimental glass transition temperatures the effect of cooling/heating rate should be considered. The glass transition temperature in- creases with increasing heating/cooling rate and this increase is approximately 3K per order of magnitude increase in rate[50, 51, 52].\n",

      "The PolymerModeler tool at nanoHUB.org features an amorphous builder that allows customized specification of monomers, including multiple monomers and monomer patterns to support stereochemistry. Chain conformations are deter- mined by specifying the torsion angle probabilities of backbone atoms. The well-known cases of freely rotating and self-avoiding chains are accurately re- produced by the builder. Structural properties of systems built by the Polymer- Modeler builder compare well with systems built by commercial packages and current state-of-the-art techniques.\n",

      "One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials. Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, as well as how to automatically develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Specifically, our pipeline for polymer property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations with a sizable 20% average reduction in prediction error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding periodicity into our polymer graph representation is responsible for a considerable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while achieving better predictive performance than human-derived features. Whereas previous polymer informatics have typically utilized hand-designed descriptors that have been optimized for representing molecules, this work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.\n",

      "The complex chemical structure of polymers provides chemists with an unprecedented level of chemical design opportunities. As a result, efforts focused on the rational design of polymers has led to their use in a remarkably wide range of applications.1,2 By varying a polymer's monomer structure, its propagation site, or the polymer chain length, the properties of the polymer can be tuned to suit the application of interest.3 6 Formulations of polymers with chemical additives adds an even richer potential design and functional space. However, efficiently navigating this vast chemical design space to identify promising polymer materials for a given application is incredibly challenging. Recently, the field of polymer informatics has shown much promise in tackling this challenge by utilizing machine learning (ML) models to learn the complex structure-property relationships of polymers.7,8 Through the development of increasingly accurate ML models, one can envision the future possibility of fully computational polymer design workflows whereby polymers can be rapidly designed in silico to satisfy multiple property criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate machine learning models require that the input to the model - be it an image, text, or chemical structure - is transformed into a machine-readable format that captures and represents all relevant features of the input. The development of suitable polymer representations to use as inputs for machine learning algorithms has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in the field of polymer informatics.9,10 Unlike molecules that consist of a fixed number of atoms and typically only contain dozens of atoms, a given polymer can consist of a periodic chain of between 100-106 repeating chemical sub-units.11\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents a considerable challenge for creating machine-readable polymer representations since they must encode the periodic nature of the polymer structure and also be compact enough to represent up to millions of atoms. Despite these challenges, previous work on small molecules and crystalline solids has demonstrated that developing physically-inspired representations of atomistic systems is a fruitful direction towards realizing significant improvements in property prediction accuracy.12-15\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we develop a new polymer representation that is the first to explicitly capture the periodic nature of polymeric materials. First, we show that the widely used monomer-based representations cannot sufficiently describe the periodic, extended structure of polymers and can result in unreliable property predictions. To solve this issue, we have developed a novel polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph and that naturally incorporates polymers' periodicity in its construction. Across a diverse spectrum of 10 unique polymer properties, we find that our polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous monomer-based representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction error. Finally, we demonstrate how our polymer graph representations can be combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework to automatically extract chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from a dataset of polymer properties. We find that these MPNN-learned polymer features yield more accurate property predictions than predetermined features that have been hand-crafted by chemists over years.\n",

      "Recently, a wide range of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately predict polymer properties in an a priori manner.16,17 These previous approaches typically represent polymers by their monomer repeat unit which is then converted into either i) molecular descriptors that includes the presence of molecular fragments and/or property descriptors (such as the molecular weight of the molecule)18-20 or ii) a molecular graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds are represented as edges (Figure 1a)).17 It should be noted that these representations were first developed for molecules before being transferred to the field of polymer informatics. Although these monomer-based representations perform well at representing finite molecules, we show in this work that monomer-based representations cannot adequately represent the extended chain structures that define polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using monomer-based representations as inputs for ML algorithms results in at least three notable issues: i) the generation of non-unique representations for polymers that are composed of the similar monomer repeat units (see \"monomer graphs\" of Polymer A and B in Figure 1 c), ii) incorrect bonding environment of the polymer, and iii) a lack of periodicity. Polymers A and B in Figure 1c) are two distinct polymers with notably different chemical structures and properties. Since the monomer of a polymer is defined as the smallest repeat unit of the polymer chain, the monomer of the two polymers in Figure 1 c) is therefore the same C-C-O subunit (or CH3 CH2OH if including hydrogen atoms). Regardless of the specific details of the featurization used, generating a representation of Polymer A and B based only on their monomers will result in two identical representations (see Supplementary Note 1). In turn, an ML algorithm that then uses these representations to learn a structure-property relationship will, at best, only be able to learn the average value of the property across the polymers, which may lead to large prediction errors. The second issue that will arise from the use of monomer-based representations is the incorrect featurization of the polymer. Polymer B consists of a repeating (-C-C-O-) backbone, which is characterized by an ether functional group (R-O-R, where R is any alkane). However, the monomer of Polymer B ( C-C-O) does not contain an ether functional group since this ether group is artificially fragmented when forming the monomer representation. This is particularly problematic since both fingerprinting approaches and property descriptors utilize the presence of functional groups and connectivity in their representations (Supplementary Note 1).21-23 Thirdly, the failure to include periodicity in these monomer-based representations results in representations that are inconsistent due to trivial translations along the polymer backbone. The polymer (-C-C-O-)n can also be written as (-C-O-C-)n by translating all atoms one position along the polymer chain. However, the monomer representations for these two equivalent polymer representations would be C-C-O and C-O-C, respectively. As shown in this example, the failure to explicitly account for periodicity in these monomer-based representations can result in inconsistent featurizations, which can negatively impact the ability of ML algorithms to learn the underlying structure-property relationships. These inconsistent featurizations are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamentally, all three of the aforementioned problems arise due to a failure to account for the periodic nature of polymers. In other words, a finite molecule (i.e. a monomer) cannot be used to represent a continuous, extended chain of atoms without fragmenting chemical bonds in an unphysical manner. We note that featurizing Polymers A and B by generating dimers (or any larger oligomer chain) instead of monomers results in unique representations. Using a dimer representation, however, still results in incorrect featurizations due to the incomplete bonding environment of the atoms at the terminal end of the dimer.\n",

      "In this work, we introduce a new polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph that solves all three of these problems. The core idea of the polymer graph is that adding a bond between the two terminal ends of the polymer chain creates a periodic polymer representation (Figure 1b)). The periodic nature of this representation eliminates the need for artificially cleaving chemical bonds, ensuring that the correct bonding environment is maintained for all atoms in the polymer. We note that this approach is strongly reminiscent of the crystal graph representations that has had wide success in representing periodic crystalline materials that extend indefinitely in all three dimensions.12 Crystal graph representations have solved the problem of representing an infinite 3-D crystal by treating it as the smallest repeat unit (referred to as the unit cell) that then transmits chemical information by interacting with periodic copies of itself in all directions. In an analogous fashion, the polymer graph developed in this work is formed from the repeat unit of the polymer that is able to transmit chemical information through the added periodic bond. We emphasize that this periodic bond is used only for representing the polymer, but should not be interpreted to mean that the polymers are always part of a chemical ring system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph-based representations of molecules and crystalline solids have recently been the subject of considerable research efforts and are currently the state-of-the-art representation for predicting the properties of these systems. 13,24,25 Generally these graphs represent each atom in the chemical system, i, by an atom embedding vector (hi) which is updated through messages that are sent through the edges of the graph. These update messages typically operate on all atoms and bonds in the local neighbor- hood of atom i, where the local neighborhood is given by the edges of the graph that are connected to atom i. To generate our polymer graph representation, we first create a standard trimer graph and then add an additional edge to connect the two terminal atoms of the trimer (Figure 1 b)). This added edge in our polymer graph representation not only maintains the correct bonding environment for all atoms, but also serves to ensure that messages (i.e. chemical information) can be sent throughout the polymer graph. For example, the left-most carbon atom in the monomer graph in Figure 1a) will only directly receive messages from the central carbon atom since this is the only atom that it is bonded to. This is not an accurate representation of the true chemical structure of this polymer since this carbon atom is directly bonded to both a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. On the other hand, since our polymer graph representation creates an edge between the terminal carbon and oxygen atoms, messages are directly passed between both of these two atoms, thus allowing the atom embedding vector of the terminal carbon atom to more accurately represent its true chemical environment. We construct the polymer graph from a trimer graph (rather than a dimer or monomer graph) to ensure that the added periodic bond is between atoms that are distinct and not already bonded to each other.\n",

      "To demonstrate the accuracy and generality of our polymer graph representation for predicting polymer properties, we collect a dataset of polymer properties containing 15,219 datapoints across 10 distinct properties (see Methods for dataset details). Notably, this dataset includes a diverse set of property types (thermal, structural, optical, electronic) as well as data collected from both experimental and computational sources, which allows us to assess the capability of our approach to learn meaningful polymer representations for general property prediction tasks. To perform a baseline comparison, we also train ML models on all 10 properties with two commonly used monomer-based representations: i) molecular descriptors and ii) molecular graphs of the monomer (Table 1). All graph-based models are trained with a MPNN model, whereas a random forest (RF) model is used for training with the monomer descriptors (see Methods for model architecture and hyperparameter details).\n",

      "Comparing the performance of the RF/Molecular Descriptors and the MPNN/Monomer Graph in Table 1 illustrates the increase in performance that is realized when using graph-based models for polymer property prediction. Across 8 out of 10 properties, the MPNN/Monomer graph model outperforms the RF/Molecular Descriptors model. On average, the MPNN/Monomer Graph model achieves 12 % lower error than the RF/Molecular Descriptors model, with remarkably large reductions in error for predicting atomization energy (43%), band gap bulk (17%), and electron affinity (32%). Both models perform similarly at predicting ionization energy, whereas the RF/Molecular Descriptors model performs slightly better only at predicting the crystallization tendency. The poor performance of the monomer graph model for predicting crystallization tendency may be due to the fact that these values were calculated with the use of an approximate group contribution method.26 The low fidelity of this dataset may therefore be preventing the graph model from learning reasonable atom/bond features for predicting crystallization tendency. Based on the results across all properties, we conclude that graph-based models can generally be expected to perform, at worst, comparably to RF/Molecular Descriptor models, with the potential to perform significantly better on certain properties. This finding is in agreement with a previous report which showed that monomer graph-based models outperform ECFP molecular descriptors for predicting the glass transition temperature, melting temperature, density, and elastic modulus for a subclass of polymers known as polyamides.17 In the present work, we expand this finding to show that graph-based models can generally be expected to outperform models based on molecular descriptors across a broader range of polymer properties and for datasets that contain all subclasses of polymers.\n",

      "Now that we have demonstrated the ability of graph-based models to perform well at predicting polymer properties, we now explore how the construction of the graph itself can influence model performance. Table 1 illustrates the performance of monomer graph and polymer graph representations with the same MPNN model. Although we have already demonstrated that the MPNN/Monomer Graph model considerably outperforms the current state-of-the-art RF/Molecular Descriptor models, we find that using our polymer graph representation results in a further 10% average reduction in error compared to the monomer graph model and does not perform significantly worse than the monomer graph model for any of the properties. The polymer graph representation results in a significant reduction in error for predicting atomization error (33%), band gap chain (15%), ionization energy (19%) and glass transition temperature (10%), compared to the monomer graph representation. Since the improvement in property prediction accuracy achieved by the polymer graph is highly property-dependant, we note that the 10% average reduction in error reported here is likely to vary depending on the chosen set of properties of interest. Nevertheless, we do not find any properties where the polymer graph performs significantly worse than the monomer graph representation, leading us to conclude that the polymer graph should be expected to yield more accurate property predictions across a wide range of properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our original hypothesis to motivate the development of our polymer graph representation was that it can improve over monomer graph representations by being able to distinguish between polymers that have the same monomer representation. To test this idea, we construct a test set of 179 glass transition temperature (Tg) datapoints where each polymer in the dataset has at least one other polymer that contains the same monomer representation, as depicted by polymers A-C in Figure 2. We train a MPNN/Monomer Graph model and a MPNN/Polymer Graph model on a Tg training set that does not include these 179 polymers and then evaluate their ability to predict the Tg of the 179 polymers in the test set. This experiment therefore allows us to quantify the impact on prediction accuracy that results from the inability of monomer graphs to distinguish between polymers that have the same monomer representation.\n",

      "As illustrated in Figure 2, the inability of the MPNN/Monomer graph model to distinguish between polymers A-C results in the same Tg prediction for all three polymers. Since the experimental Tg value varies largely between these three polymers, this results in an unacceptably large prediction error of over 60℃. Although polymers A-C are chosen as an illustrative example, a more statistically significant comparison can be obtained from the performance on the entire test set of 179 polymers. Consistent with our original hypothesis, we see that the inability of the monomer graph representation to distinguish between the polymers in this test set results in significantly worse performance when compared to Table 1 (49°C vs. 39℃). On the other hand, the polymer graph representation is not only able to distinguish between these polymers, but also quantitatively capture the trends in Tg values for polymers A-C with a RMSE that is nearly 60% less than that of the monomer graph.

By being able to distinguish between polymers of the same monomer structure, the polymer graph representation is therefore better able to learn quantitative structure-property relationships for the properties in Table 1. Since the proportion of polymers that have the same monomer structure is relatively small ( 2% of the Tg dataset), we anticipate that this effect is currently small, but will grow in importance as more polymers are discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of the experiment shown in Figure 2 also have important practical implications for the reliability that can be expected when using ML methods to discover new polymers. The Tg of a polymer is the temperature at which the thermal motions of the polymers are large enough to overcome the forces that hold the amorphous polymer together, such that the polymer is able to undergo large-scale molecular motions.27 Accurately predicting the glass transition temperature is therefore of great importance since Tg is often treated as the maximum temperature that the polymer can be used.28 Despite having identical chemical compositions, the three polymers shown in Figure 2 exhibit a remarkably broad range of experimental Tg values due to their unique chemical structures. In particular, the presence of the hydroxyl (OH) group on Polymer A leads to an increase in interchain attractive forces, resulting in a significantly larger Tg value than for Polymers B and C.29 The inability of monomer-based graph representations to distinguish between these polymers therefore severely hurts the trustworthiness of the model. If one were to use the MPNN/Monomer Graph model to discover new polymers, the large errors in this subset of Tg predictions could manifest in the discovery of polymers that are thermodynamically unstable at the desired operating temperature. By comparison, the consistent performance seen by the MPNN/Polymer Graph model helps to instill confidence that the predictions will be robust across a large dataset of polymer materials.\n",

Understanding specifically how polymer representation can impact predictive performance is important for the development of increasingly better polymer representations. To accomplish this goal, we perform several ablation experiments whereby we systematically alter components of the polymer graph representation to allow us to quantify the contribution of each component to overall model performance (Figure 3). We conduct this experiment by training the same MPNN model as before on the same 10 properties listed in Table 1.

Based on this finding, we anticipate that using even larger graph representations (i.e. tetramer or pentamer) will not improve model performance, but will unnecessarily require more computational resources for model training. Finally, comparing the performance of the dimer graph and the monomer graph representations illustrates that including more than one repeat unit in the graph significantly improves performance. It may seem counter-intuitive that the trimer graph and dimer graph representations perform similarly, whereas dimer graph representations considerably outperform monomer graph representations. However, this result can be explained by noting that the dimer graph representation contains additional chemical bonding information, relative to the monomer graph, since it directly represents the atoms that are bonded together to form the polymer chain. On the other hand, the trimer/dimer graph representations do not differ in the chemical information that they contain, but are simply scaled versions of each other.\n",

      "We note from the ablation experiments illustrated in Figure 3 that the largest reduction in error relative to the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline is due to using graph-based representations with the MPNN model. Using graph-based models results in at least a 13% average reduction in error, relative to the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline, whereas further refinements to the graph representation only affects the average performance by approximately 3-5%. To better understand why using graph-based representations in combination with a MPNN architecture leads to such a significant performance improvement, we analyze the learned feature vectors that are generated from the MPNN model. The MPNN model utilized in this work uses learned bond and atom features that are aggregated into a single fixed-length vector. This aggregated vector is then passed through a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers to generate the final property prediction. As a result, the vector in the final hidden layer of this feed-forward neural network can be considered as a learned encoding of the polymer that has been optimized by the MPNN model to make accurate property predictions. These vector encodings can therefore be analyzed to determine what chemical information the MPNN model is using to generate its predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline used previously (Table 1) utilizes pre-determined molecular descriptors (such as molecular weight), the vector encodings extracted from our MPNN model are vector representations that have been specifically optimized for the particular property that they are trained on. Comparing the performance of the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline and a RF model trained with these learned encodings therefore allows us to quantitatively understand if the superior performance of the graph-based models are due to these optimized encodings or the MPNN model architecture. To perform this experiment, we train the MPNN model on k-1 folds (k=5) of the Tg dataset. This trained MPNN model is then used to generate vector encodings for the polymers in the same k-1 folds of the dataset. Then, these vector encodings are used as inputs to train the RF model on the same k-1 folds of the dataset that the MPNN model was trained on. Finally, the test performance of the RF model is calculated for the remaining fold of the dataset that was not seen by the MPNN model nor the RF model in training. This procedure is repeated for k iterations to ensure that each fold of the dataset is used as the test set once and the reported performance is averaged across these k iterations. This training procedure prevents data leakage by ensuring that the test set is not seen by the MPNN model or the RF model before determining test performance.\n",

This result suggests that the excellent performance of the MPNN/Polymer Graph model is not due to MPNNs being a more powerful model architecture. Rather, the learned descriptors that the MPNN model extracts provides a more meaningful representation of polymers, leading to superior predictive capability. This finding is exciting because it suggests that the use of learned polymer representations that better capture the underlying chemical properties of polymers can lead to greatly improved predictive capabilities, even with relatively simple model architectures like random forests. It is important to note that the predetermined molecular descriptors that have been previously used for polymer prediction tasks were first developed as general descriptors for molecules, but with no guarantee that these descriptors will contain properties that are relevant for describing polymer properties.21 On the other hand, these learned MPNN descriptors are specifically trained to capture the relevant components of a polymer's structure that give rise to its properties. In this way, the MPNN model explored in this work provides a recipe for automatically extracting meaningful polymer representations directly from polymer property datasets in a manner that does not require any hand-crafted featurization.\n",

The 5 molecular descriptors that are most correlated with the MPNN learned features for the MPNN/Polymer Graph model are depicted in Figure 4b). Two of the most important known structural features for predicting Tg in polymers is: i) the presence of polar functional groups such as NH2 and OH that increase intermolecular forces, resulting in a higher Tg value and ii) the stiffness of the polymer chain, which is typically described in terms of the presence of rigid ring structures in the polymer backbone.27 The molecular descriptors shown in Figure 4b) are colored according to which one of these two known structural factors they explicitly capture. Interestingly, we see that the majority of the learned MPNN features are strongly correlated with these known relevant chemical features, which suggests that our MPNN model is autonomously learning the chemical features that are responsible for Tg directly from the dataset of Tg values. In particular, the most heavily weighted MPNN feature is correlated with the presence of polar groups, whereas the other top 5 features provide complex descriptions of the presence of ring structures in the polymer. However, we emphasize that these MPNN polymer encodings also contain new information that is not captured by the predetermined descriptors, as is shown by the superior performance of the RF model when using learned descriptors instead of predetermined descriptors (Figure 4a).\n",

Through a number of illustrative examples, we have demonstrated how a failure to account for periodicity in polymers can lead to property predictions that are inaccurate and unreliable. We have shown that these issues can be mitigated by our novel polymer graph representation that explicitly accounts for the inherent periodicity of polymeric materials. The results presented here therefore demonstrate that utilizing chemical intuition to construct physically-informed polymer representations is a viable strategy for advancing the predictive capabilities of ML models.\n",

      "The polymer informatics community has benefited greatly from the adaptation of machine learning algorithms and representations that were first developed for molecules. This approach is based on the assumption that general molecular descriptors are likely to work well across a broad spectrum of chemical classes, including polymers. In this work, we test this assumption by exploring the improvement in property predictions that can be achieved through the use of learned descriptors that are specifically optimized to capture the unique structural characteristics of polymers. We have shown that utilizing polymer-specific descriptors results in considerable improvements in the accuracy of polymer property predictions, compared to standard molecular descriptors. These results suggest that the structural characteristics that give rise to polymer properties are distinct from general molecular descriptors. This is perhaps unsurprising since it is well known that polymers are affected by structural elements that do not have molecular analogues, such as the branching structure of the polymer or its interchain interactions. We anticipate that the continued development of representations that are customized to capture the unique and complex structure of polymeric systems is therefore a fruitful direction for further pushing the limits of predicting polymer properties with ML.\n",

This network architecture operates on input molecular graphs to first generate a vector encoding of the graph, followed by a feed-forward neural network that converts the graph encodings into property predictions. The size of the bond message vectors is set to 300 and a total of 3 message-passing steps are used. The feed-forward neural network consists of 2 hidden layers, each consisting of 300 hidden neurons. All hyperparameters used are the Chemprop default values. We point interested readers to the Chemprop documentation for an extensive list of all hyperparameters used in this architecture.13 Unless otherwise stated, all models are trained with 5-fold cross-validation (CV) for 50 epochs on each fold. The best-performing model is chosen by selecting the model with the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) performance on the validation set. The Random Forest (RF) model was implemented in scikit-learn version 0.24.1 with 500 trees.31\n",

      "To illustrate the inconsistencies that arise when using preexisting molecular descriptors to represent polymers, Figure S1 provides a visualize of the molecular descriptors generated from RDKit for 4 representative SMILES strings. According to the syntax of the SMILES strings, the '*' character is used to indicate the connection between repeating units of a polymer. The SMILES notation also does not explicitly indicate hydrogen atoms, but instead assumes that all atoms have the number of hydrogen atoms required for full valency. The '*CCO*' SMILES string therefore represents a (-CH2-CH2-O-)n polymer and the '*COC*' SMILES string represents the same polymer, (-CH2-O-CH2-)n, that has been trivially translated along the polymer backbone. Even though '*CCO*' and '*COC*' represent the same polymer, Figure S1 illustrates the different feature vectors that are generated from these SMILES strings. An understanding of why this difference arises can be obtained by looking at the molecular fragment features that are generated for these two SMILES string. The only difference in the molecular fragment features is the 'fr_ether' feature, which is a binary feature that indicates the presence of an ether functional group. As shown in Figure S1, the '*CCO*' has fr_ether=0 (indicating the absence of an ether), whereas '*COC*' has fr_ether=1 (indicating the presence of an ether). Evidently, the inconsistent featurization between these two chemically identical SMILES strings is due to a lack of periodicity. Since the '*CCO*' SMILES string does not treat the terminal oxygen atom as being bonded to two neighboring carbon atoms, using the '*CCO*' SMILES string results in an incorrect featurization of fr_ether=0, when this polymer does in fact contain an ether.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of including the '*' character in the SMILES representation is illustrated with feature vectors of the 'CCO' and 'COC' SMILES strings, which are the monomer subunits of '*CCO*' and '*COC*', respectively. Interestingly, all four of these inputs yield four different feature vectors. Although these inconsistencies could be accounted for by designating a standardized SMILES string to use as an input for a given polymer, it is unlikely that such a standardized system would always capture the correct periodicity of the polymer. Instead, the use of the polymer graph representation as described in the main text ensures that the periodicity of the polymer is maintained and always generates a consistent representation.\n",

      "The paper addresses the challenge of accurately representing the complex structures of polymers for machine learning (ML) property predictions by introducing a new representation called \"polymer graphs.\" These graphs account for the periodic nature of polymers, essential for accurate structure-property relationships. The authors demonstrate that their polymer graph representation, used with Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), significantly reduces prediction errors for various polymer properties compared to traditional monomer-based representations. By capturing periodicity and chemically-relevant features, the polymer graph approach consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations. The results highlight the capability of learned descriptors to enhance predictive accuracy over general molecular descriptors, offering a valuable improvement in polymer informatics.\n",

      "Vitrimer is a new, exciting class of sustainable polymers with the ability to heal due to their dynamic covalent adaptive network that can go through associative rearrangement reactions. However, a limited choice of constituent molecules restricts their property space, prohibiting full realization of their potential applications. To overcome this challenge, we couple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a novel graph variational autoencoder (VAE) machine learning model for inverse design of vitrimer chemistries with desired glass transition temperature (Tg) and synthesize a novel vitrimer polymer. We build the first vitrimer dataset of one million chemistries and calculate Tg on 8,424 of them by high-throughput MD simulations calibrated by a Gaussian process model. The proposed novel VAE employs dual graph encoders and a latent dimension overlapping scheme which allows for individual representation of multi-component vitrimers. By constructing a continuous latent space containing necessary information of vitrimers, we demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of our framework in discovering novel vitrimers with desirable Tg beyond the training regime. To validate the effectiveness of our framework in experiments, we generate novel vitrimer chemistries with a target Tg = 323 K. By incorporating chemical intuition, we synthesize a vitrimer with Tg of 311-317 K, and experimentally demonstrate healability and flowability. The proposed framework offers an exciting tool for polymer chemists to design and synthesize novel, sustainable vitrimer polymers for a facet of applications.\n",

      "Polymers are essential to a broad range of applications from cars and wind turbines to smartphones, medical devices and more; however their performance decreases over their life-cycle initiated by bond breaking at the molecular scale due to high stress, oxidation, or other factors. Mechanical damage due to the rupturing of covalent bonds in traditional thermosets and thermoplastics is irreversible, resulting in crack formation and finally failure1. In such circumstances, plastics end up in waste streams due to the inability to serve the desired purpose, which presents two key challenges for sustainability. First, failure in repairing mechanical damage means polymer parts and often entire assemblies must be replaced, resulting in high economic cost and further increasing the 430 million tons of plastic produced annually. Second, the inability of polymers to repair molecular damage poses a fundamental challenge preventing recycling of thermosets altogether and the degradation of thermoplastics such as PET water bottles into highly degraded secondary raw materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Healable polymers, particularly a new class called vitrimers, offer a potential solution to the plastic waste problem. Combining durability with end-of-life recyclability, vitrimers have the potential to greatly reduce the amount of plastic production and waste2. The defining molecular feature of vitrimers is associative dynamic covalent adaptive network (CAN) which allows the constituents of polymer chains to attach to and detach from each other while conserving crosslinking density under an external stimulus such as heat. This gives vitrimers the ability of self-healing without loss of viscosity3 (Figure 1a). This exchange of constituents is termed a rearrangement reaction, and polymer scientists have found multiple reaction chemistries on which to base vitrimers, including transesterification, disulfide exchange, and imine exchange4. However, available vitrimers have restricted thermo-mechanical properties due to limited commercially available monomers (i.e., building blocks) for synthesizing these polymers, which is a key impediment to widespread applications of vitrimers.\n",

      "the novel polymers are discovered and synthesized based on chemical intuition in a trial-and-error fashion7. As chemical synthesis of polymers is expensive and time consuming, virtual specimen fabrication and characterization of desired chemical structures using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations may be employed to reduce the cost of experimentation. MD is a simulation technique situated at the interface of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics and has been widely employed to assist the discovery process8. Virtual characterization using MD has helped in gaining insights about the effect of polymer molecular structures on mechanical properties9, glass transition temperature10 and self-healing11. However, scaled computational screens assisted by MD or other simulation methods remain costly, even with the development of high-performance computing12. As a result, the searchable design space is limited to the order of 103 to 105 compositions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms offer an opportunity to accelerate polymer discovery by learning from available data, revealing hidden patterns in material properties13 and reducing the need for costly experiments and simulations14. Various ML methods have been employed to design organic molecules and polymers, including forward predictive models15-18, generative adversarial networks19-21, variational autoencoders (VAEs) 22-26, diffusion models27,28 and large language models29. The trained ML models can be further used for high-throughput screening or conditioned upon physical properties to achieve the inverse design of polymers from properties of interest, such as glass transition temperature (Tg)16,17, thermal conductivity18, 30,31, bandgap25 and gas-separation properties18, 32. The success in these ML models depends on the choice of suitable representations, which is challenging due to the discrete and undefined degrees of freedom of molecules and polymers. To date, researchers have employed strings33, 34, molecular fingerprints35 and graphs36 to represent molecules and monomers in ML models. In this work, we propose a graph VAE model employing dual graph encoders and overlapping latent dimensions37, 38 which enable representation of multi-component vitrimers and controlled design of selective components simultaneously.\n",

      "Last few years have seen an increased contribution to structures and properties databases of polymers and molecules such as ZINC1539, ChemSpider40 and PubChem41. However, a dataset of vitrimers to train such a deep generative model is lacking. Furthermore, part of the dataset needs to be associated with the property of interest to enable property-guided inverse design. Vitrimers are characterized by two key thermal properties: glass transition temperature (Tg) and topology freezing temperature (Tv). To describes the transition from glassy state to rubbery state while Ty describes the transition from viscoelastic solids to viscoelastic liquids. At service temperatures, vitrimers perform like traditional polymers, but when heated to Tv, the chains gain mobility and carry out exchange\n",

      "reactions at the reactive sites. Traditionally, vitrimer polymers exhibit Ty > To 11,42; this makes their future application easier since Tg dictates design protocols, and healing in vitrimers happens at temperatures higher than Tg. Therefore, in this work, we focus our efforts on designing vitrimers with targeted Tg. We build the first vitrimer dataset derived from the online database ZINC1539 and calculate Tg by calibrated MD simulations on a subset of vitrimers (Figure 1a,b).\n",
      "\n",
      "Leveraging this vitrimer dataset, we build an integrated MD-ML framework for discovery of bifunctional transesterification vitrimers with desirable properties specifically targeted Tg for the scope of this work (Figure 1b). Each vitrimer contains two reactive constituents (i.e., carboxylic acid and epoxide). Furthermore, the discrete nature of the molecules prohibits a smooth and continuous design space. For example, while molecules are interpretable to human, they are not interpretable to a numerical optimizer for design of vitrimers. To this end, we develop a VAE that receives as input a vitrimer represented by graphs and subgraphs of the constituents and produces a smooth and continuous latent space. In such a latent space, two similar vitrimers are located close to each other while an optimizer can traverse the space of all possible vitrimers. Our unique VAE framework offers both constituent-specific and joint latent spaces of the chemical constituents, i.e., continuous screening and optimization can be performed on just one or both of the constituents. This enables interpretability on the effects of optimizing over, e.g., acid only, epoxide only, or simultaneously acid and epoxide molecules. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated by discovering novel vitrimers with Tg both within and well beyond the dataset. Specifically, while the Tg in the training data ranges from 250 K to 500 K, we discover vitrimers with Tg around 569 K and 248 K (Figure 1c). To validate the framework predictions, we generate vitrimer chemistries with a Ty of 323 K (50 ℃). We choose this Tg range to develop vitrimers comparable to commonly used polyamides that find applications in transportation, electronics, consumer goods, and packaging. We examine the top candidates suggested by framework and use chemical intuition to further ensure simpler synthesizability and thermodynamic stability (Figure 1d). The novel, synthesized vitrimer is characterized and experimental Tg is in good agreement with inverse design target Tg. This validates the proposed framework, which is sufficiently general to be applied to different types of vitrimers and their properties, as a tool for polymer chemists to discover and synthesize novel vitrimer chemistries with desirable properties.\n",

      "We begin by creating a vitrimer dataset to train the VAE model. Since there are only a few available bifunctional transesterification vitrimers recorded in literature, we create a dataset of hypothetical vitrimers by combining carboxylic acids and epoxides. We first build two datasets by collecting available bifunctional carboxylic acids and epoxides from the online chemical compound database ZINC1539. To further broaden the chemical space, we augment the datasets by adding hypothetical carboxylic acids and epoxides derived from available alcohols, olefins and phenols in the ZINC15 database. In both datasets, molecules satisfying all following rules are kept: (i) Carboxylic acid and epoxide-containing monomers have exactly two occurrences of their defining functional group (to restrict compositions to linear chains). (ii) Molecules with molecular weight smaller than 500 g/mol (to restrict the sizes of the molecular graphs and facilitate training of the graph VAE). (iii) Molecules with C, H, N, O elements only (to emulate the existing transesterification vitrimers). After filtering, two datasets of around 322,000 carboxylic acids and 625,000 epoxides are constructed. To ensure synthesizability, we select the 50,000 acids and 50,000 epoxides with lowest synthetic accessibility (SA) scores43 (i.e., those predicted to be easiest to synthesize). The final dataset is built by randomly sampling one million vitrimers from the design space of 2.5 billion possible combinations between the selected acids and epoxides, as shown in Figure 2a.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve property-guided inverse design, we further compute Tg of the vitrimers. Since MD simulations of the entire one-million dataset are computationally intractable, we calculate Tg of 8,424 vitrimers randomly sampled from the dataset. The quantity can cover a sufficient amount of vitrimers in the design space as well as keep the computational cost to a reasonable level. For each vitrimer, we create a virtual specimen then minimize and anneal the structure to remove local heterogeneities by slowly heating it to 800 K. A snapshot of the annealed system of an example vitrimer (adipic acid and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether) is shown in Figure 2a. The annealed structure is held at 800 K for an additional 50 ps and five specimens separated by 10 ps are obtained. To measure densities at different temperatures for Tg calculation, each specimen is cooled down from 800 K to 100 K linearly in steps of 10 K. By fitting a bilinear regression to the density-temperature profile, we calculate Tg as the intersection point of the two linear regressions (Figure 2a). Five replicate simulations are carried out from each specimen to reduce the noise due to the stochastic nature of MD. The distributions of average Ty and coefficient of variation (i.e., ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) in Tg of the vitrimers calculated by the five replicate MD simulations are shown in Supplementary Figures 2a and 2b, respectively. The coefficients of variation in Tg of most of the vitrimers are\n",

      "Due to the large difference in the cooling rate between MD simulations and experiments, MD-calculated Tg is typically overestimated compared with experimental measurements. Compensating for this artifact, Afzal et al. have achieved good correlation between MD-simulated Tg and experimental Tg on 315 polymers using ordinary least squares44. However, we find empirically that a simple two-parameter linear fit is insufficient to reduce the effect of larger noise in our MD simulations with smaller systems and fewer replicates (see Supplementary Figure 3c). Instead, we employ a Gaussian process (GP) regression model to calibrate MD calculations against available experimental data. GP is a probabilistic model that uses a kernel (covariance) function to make probabilistic predictions based on the distance between the queried data point and a training set45. In order to construct a training dataset for the GP model, we gather 292 polymers from the Bicerano Handbook46 and the Chemical Retrieval on the Web (CROW) polymer database47, each with documented experimental Tg. If the same polymer appears in both literature sources with different recorded Tg, the average of both values is calculated as final Tg. The available experimental data of three bifunctional transesterification vitrimers11,48,49 is also included and the dataset contains 295 polymers in total. We compute Tg for this experimental polymer dataset using the MD protocols described above and calculate the experiment-MD difference ATg for each of these polymers. To numerically represent both the polymers within the training set and the vitrimers to be calibrated as inputs for the GP model, we apply extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs)35 to the repeating units of the polymers, where asterisks (*) indicate connection points. We train the GP model to predict ATg from molecular fingerprints, as shown in Figure 2b. The calibrated Tg is defined as\n",

      "To evaluate the performance of our GP model, we implement leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). In this process, we train our GP model on all data points in the training set except one point and predict its calibrated Tg. We repeat this process for all 295 polymers in the training set and compare the calibrated Tg with experimental Tg recorded in literature. The mean absolute error (MAE) is 28.07 K (Supplementary Figure 3), which is comparable to the results by Afzal et al.44 (MAE = 27.35 K) with larger systems and longer simulation time. The error is partially attributed to inconsistencies in recorded experimental Tg between the two literature sources46,47. Experimentally measured Tg values for some polymers (such as polypropylene, polyvinylcyclohexane, etc.) differ by approximately 30 K gathered from two literature sources46,47. By utilizing the comprehensive GP model trained on the entire training dataset without LOOCV, we proceed to calibrate Tg of the vitrimer dataset calculated by MD simulations. The distributions of Tg of the vitrimers before and after GP calibration are shown in Figure 2c and both distributions approach Gaussian. The average To before and after calibration is 423 K and 373 K, respectively. Since the cooling rate in our MD simulations is 12 orders of magnitude higher than typical experiments, the difference of 50 K is consistent with the Williams-Landel-Ferry theory that estimates an increase in Tg of 3 to 5 K per order of magnitude increase in the cooling rate50. Ten vitrimers with highest and lowest calibrated Tg are shown in Supplementary Figure 4, indicating the wide chemical and property space covered by the dataset. In this work, we denote Tg as the calibrated value from MD simulations, which serves as a proxy of the true experimental Tg.

Any two molecules can have different degrees of freedom (e.g., number of atoms and bonds) and extra attention needs to be paid to the choice of representations. Here we adopt the hierarchical graph representation of molecules developed by a Jin et al.24. A molecule is first represented as a graph G = (V, E) with atoms as nodes V and bonds as edges E. We decompose the molecule G into n motifs M1, ... , Mn. Each motif Mi = (Vi, Ei) where i E {1, ... , n} is a subgraph with atoms Vi and edges E ;. The ensuing step involves a three-level hierarchical graph representation (see Supplementary Figure 5 for a schematic illustration). The motif level GM establishes macroscopic connections in a tree-like structure, the attachment level GA encodes inter-motif connectivity via shared atoms, and the atom level G captures finer atomic relationships. More details about the hierarchical graph representation are presented in Supplementary Note 3.1.\n",

Similarly, the epoxide decoder Pie is used to output the epoxide molecule ge' from the epoxide-specific and shared dimensions of z. More specifically, the decoders iteratively expand the graphs at three hierarchical levels. At step t, three multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are used to predict the probability distributions of each motif node p'M., attachment node p'4, and atoms to be attached p'u.v), (see Supplementary Note 3.2 for more details). An additional MLP is used to predict the probability of backtracing pb,, i.e., when there will be no new neighbors to add to the motif node. Both decoders are optimized to accurately reconstruct the molecules, i.e., gal ~ Ga and Ge' ~ ge. Practically this is achieved by minimizing the error between all four predicted probability distributions with respect to the one-hot encoded ground truth, i.e., pM., PA,, P(u,v); and pb, for t = 1, ... , tmax where tmax is the maximum number of iterations based on depth-first search of the input molecule (here for simplicity we omit superscripts a and e denoting acid and epoxide).

The ratio of successfully reconstructed (i.e., both carboxylic acid and epoxide decoded from u are identical to input molecules) is 85.4%, which demonstrates well-trained encoders and decoders capable of accommodating and reconstructing vitrimers unseen by the VAE. Examples of ten vitrimers from the test set and the corresponding reconstructions are presented in Supplementary Figure 6. Eight vitrimers are perfectly reconstructed, while one component of vitrimers is decoded into different but similar molecules in the two unsuccessful examples.\n",

      "We then assess the performance of the VAE to generate vitrimers. We sample 1,000 latent vectors z from standard Gaussian distribution and decode them into the carboxylic acid and epoxide molecules constituting vitrimers. 85.2% of the sampled vitrimers are valid, i.e., the composing acid and epoxide molecules are chemically valid and contain exactly two carboxylic acid and epoxide groups. Even though the decoders are not explicitly coded to only output carboxylic acids and epoxides (e.g., by making the decoders build up molecules based on two carboxylic acid and epoxide functional groups), most of the randomly sampled latent vectors are decoded to molecules containing the desired functionality. Examples of sampled vitrimers are shown in Supplementary Figure 7. Components of the three invalid sampled vitrimers are also carboxylic acids and epoxides but do not have exactly two functional groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from validity, we are also interested in novelty and uniqueness of the generated vitrimers, which are defined as the ratio of sampled vitrimers which are not present in the training set and the expected fraction of unique vitrimers per sampled vitrimers, respectively. Results show that all of the 1,000 vitrimers sampled from the latent space are novel and unique, which greatly benefits the discovery of vitrimers by exploring the latent space.\n",

The improved reconstruction accuracy and sample validity show that the second-step joint training enhances the performance of the model and that the encoders and decoders are not biased to the limited data in Dprop.\n",

      "The property predictor maps latent space encoded from vitrimers to Ty and serves as a surrogate model for estimating Tg without the need for costly MD simulations. We evaluate the predictive power of the property predictor network by encoding the vitrimers in the test set into mean vectors u and predicting the associated Tg. The predicted Tg and true Tg are compared in Supplementary Figure 8. A mean absolute error of 13.53 K indicates accurate prediction of Tg by the property predictor which facilitates the inverse design process.\n",

As shown in Supplementary Figure 9a and 9b, the distribution of the latent vectors shows an obvious gradient in both training and test sets, where vitrimers with higher Tg cluster in the lower left region. Such a well-structured latent space based on properties benefits discovery of novel vitrimers with desired Tg. For comparison, the latent vector distribution before joint training is presented in Supplementary Figure 9c and 9d. The much less obvious trend confirms the effect of joint training on latent space organization.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The well trained, continuous latent space enables us to discover new vitrimers by exploring the latent space through modifications of latent vectors z. For example, we start with the latent vector z0 of a known vitrimer (adipic acid and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether) as origin and sample latent vectors in the neighborhood by perturbing z0. Previous works that employ multi-component VAEs (i.e., VAEs with multiple encoders and decoders) simply add embedding or mean (log variance) vectors from encoders to derive the unified latent vector z32. The effect of different components is not considered individually and a change in z leads to potential changes in all components. The partially overlapping latent dimensions (Equation 2) allow us to explore the vicinity of the origin z0 along different axes by adding noise to acid-specific latent dimensions (first da dimensions of z0), epoxide-specific latent dimensions (last de dimensions of z0) and all latent dimensions of z0 (details are provided in Supplementary Note 3.4). Consequently, novel vitrimers with changes in only acid, only epoxide and both components are identified by decoding the latent vectors modified along three axes, as shown in Figures 4a-c. The decoded vitrimers present variety in molecular structures without significant changes in Tg (Figure 4f) due to limited search region in latent space, which opens an opportunity to tailor a specific vitrimer to its novel variants with different molecular structures but preserve certain property similarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides neighborhood search, we perform an interpolation between two points in the latent space and identify a series of new vitrimers along the path. Figure 4d presents an example of spherical interpolation (SLERP) 55 between vitrimers with highest and lowest Tg in the training set. As opposed to linear interpolation (LERP), we use SLERP because Gaussian distribution in high dimensions closely follows the surface of a hypersphere. The decoded vitrimers show a smooth transition from the low-Tg vitrimer with linear structure to the high-Tg vitrimer with more aromatic nature. The continuous transition between molecular structures and Tg (Figure 4f) evidences the smoothness of the latent space with associated Tg. The vitrimers discovered by LERP and their associated Tg are shown in Supplementary Figure 10. More details on spherical and linear interpolation schemes are presented in Supplementary Note 3.4.\n",

      "## Inverse design by Bayesian optimization\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The VAE together with the property predictor succeeds in learning the hidden relationships between latent space and Tg of vitrimers, which allows us to tailor vitrimer compositions to desirable Tg even beyond the training regime. Although we have achieved forward projection from the vitrimer space (or latent space) to property space, the inverse mapping is more challenging due to the fact that multiple distinct vitrimers could have a similar Tg. To achieve inverse design of vitrimers with optimal or desirable Tg, we employ batch Bayesian optimization to identify the latent vectors z that have the potential to be decoded into vitrimers with target Tg. The proposed candidates are further validated by MD simulations with GP calibration, and the optimal solutions with desirable Tg are found. Due to the discrete nature of molecules, the latent vectors proposed by the optimization process may lead to invalid molecules. Furthermore, since the discrete molecules are projected onto a continuous latent space by the VAE, it is inevitable that multiple distinct latent vectors in the neighborhood can be decoded into the same vitrimer but are associated with different Tg predicted by the property predictor. This severely limits the accuracy and efficiency of the optimization process. To this end, we add an additional decoding-encoding step before passing z to the property\n",

      "predictor to predict Tg (Supplementary Figure 11). More specifically, when evaluating the Tg of a point of interest z in the latent space during the optimization process, z is first decoded into a carboxylic acid and an epoxide. If both molecules are valid, they are passed to the encoders to obtain the reconstructed mean vector precon, which is further passed to the property predictor to evaluate the Tg. In this way, the Bayesian optimization algorithm is able to search for potential candidates with desirable Tg efficiently without proposing the same vitrimer for a large number of iterations. More details about Bayesian optimization are provided in Supplementary Note 3.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "To demonstrate the effectiveness of our inverse design framework, we use Bayesian optimization to discover novel vitrimers with three different targets: maximum Tg, Tg = 373 K and Tg = 248 K. Tg of the proposed candidates is validated by MD simulations and GP calibration. For each target, four examples of discovered vitrimers are presented in Figure 5. For the first target (maximum Tg), our VAE model generates novel vitrimers with MD-validated Tg beyond the upper bound of Tg in the training data (500 K) and thereby expands the limits in thermal properties of bifunctional transesterification vitrimers. The Bayesian optimization procedures are able to probe the latent space outside of the training domain and propose novel vitrimers with extreme properties, which is difficult for traditional forward modeling methods to find. For the second target, the Bayesian optimization algorithm effectively searches the latent space and successfully proposes vitrimers with the exact target Tg of 373 K. The corresponding latent vectors are spread out in the latent space and the vitrimer compositions present significant molecular variety. For the third target which is the lower bound of the training domain (248 K), the proposed vitrimers (especially carboxylic acids) are more similar to each other and occupy a small region in the latent space. This can be attributed to the fact that there are not many linear molecules with more aliphatic nature in the 50,000 acids or epoxides making the training set. As a result, the distribution of these vitrimers with low Tg is insufficiently captured by the VAE and the proposed candidates of low-Tg vitrimers are restrained by the limited training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tg distributions of the dataset and around 100 designed vitrimers for each target are presented in Supple- mentary Figure 12. For the target of maximum Tg, our model efficiently discovers novel vitrimer chemistries beyond the training property space. For the other two targets of 373 K and 248 K, the distributions are centered around the design target. Ten examples of novel vitrimers discovered by Bayesian optimization for each target are presented in Supplementary Figure 13. For the first target, all ten proposed vitrimers have validated Tg larger than 500 K, which indicates the effective extrapolation beyond the training domain by our framework. For the other two targets of finding vitrimers with exact target Tg, the discovered vitrimers present Tg within a range of 2 K around the target and maintain considerable molecular diversity, proving the high accuracy in the inverse design process. We further examine the stability of the proposed molecules by minimizing them by reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF) using the CHON2017_ weak_bb force field9. All molecules remain stable during minimization and the minimized structures are presented in Supplementary Figure 14.\n",
      "\n",
      "We carry out further analysis based on the molecular descriptors of ten proposed vitrimers for each target. The molecular descriptors except density are calculated from the vitrimer repeating units (Supplementary Figure 1a with n = 1) by the Modred package56. Density of each vitrimer at 300 K is extracted from MD simulations. The relevant descriptors of designed low, medium and high temperature vitrimers are presented in Supplementary Figure 15. The vitrimers with higher Tg have larger molecular weight, higher density, more heavy atoms and multiple bonds and fewer rotatable bonds. Consequently, the chains in these vitrimers are more rigid and less mobile, which agrees with the common knowledge of structure-Tg relationships in polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We compare Tg of the designed vitrimers with nine commonly used polymers in Supplementary Figure 16. The proposed vitrimers cover a wide range of Tg suitable for various applications from coating materials to aerospace polymers. With further tuning of the target, our framework has the potential to discover vitrimer compositions with any Tg within an expanded range and expedite the widespread applications of sustainable polymers in various industries.\n",

      "To experimentally validate the effectiveness of the VAE model, we perform Bayesian optimization to propose novel vitrimers with a target Tg of 323 K. Since epoxides are typically more difficult to synthesize, the epoxide molecule is fixed as bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA) during optimization to improve synthesizability of the vitrimer. In other words, the shared and epoxide-specific dimensions are fixed while we only optimize acid-specific dimensions in Equation 2. Out of the carboxylic acids proposed by the VAE model, four acids with low SA scores (2.39 to 2.61) and symmetric structures are further analyzed for synthesis feasibility. Additionally, some of these acid molecules have an amine group that can react with epoxide rings to form irreversible covalent bonds, thereby reducing the adaptive nature of the macromolecular network. Keeping these thermodynamical stability issues in polymer synthesis and resulting crosslinked network through chemical intuition, we make slight modifications to the proposed structures to achieve a symmetric acid molecule with a lower SA score (2.23) that can be synthesized using off-the-shelf chemicals.\n",

      "The synthesis of the novel vitrimer chemistry is carried out by the ring opening reaction of succinic anhydride by glycerol followed by immediate crosslinking with DGEBA. The reaction of beta-hydroxy groups of glycerol with succinic anhydride opens the ring and creates carboxylic functional groups. The resultant acid is crosslinked with DGEBA in presence of catalyst triazabicyclodecene (TBD) to yield the final vitrimer product (Figure 6b). The cured vitrimer is verified using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, as shown in Supplementary Figure 17. The characteristic peaks for carbonyl groups at 1728 cm-1 and for aromatic epoxide chains at 1033 to 1028 cm-1 are observed. In addition, other peaks at 1400 to 1608 cm-1 indicate the formation of ester linkages between acids and epoxides. We further characterize the thermal properties of the synthesized vitrimer using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermomechanical analysis (TMA), as shown in Figure 6c. DSC result shows one transition temperature (Tg) at 317 K, indicating complete curing of crosslinked vitrimer. TMA result presents two thermal transitions, first at 311 K for Tg and second at 489 K for Ty. The difference in Tg from DSC and TMA arises due to different physical phenomena and sensitivities measured by each technique. DSC measures heat flow associated with the glass transition, which reflects changes in heat capacity as the polymer transitions from a glassy to a rubbery state, it therefore provides an average Tg. TMA on the other hand measures the mechanical response of the polymer to non-isothermal creep and the machine detects subtle changes in molecular mobility through dimensional changes. Experimental Tg from DSC and TMA agrees well with the design target (323 K) and demonstrates the capability of our framework to design novel vitrimers with desired experimental Tg. The second transition indicates flowability of the vitrimer at elevated temperature when dynamic exchange reactions start to occur and enhance polymer chain mobility. To confirm healability of the vitrimer, we cut a pristine specimen and heal it at temperature around Ty. The surfaces of pristine, cut, and healed samples are examined under the microscope (Figure 6d). The complete removal of damage shows healability and recyclability of the synthesized novel vitrimer chemistry.\n",

      "We develop an integrated MD-ML framework for inverse design of bifunctional transesterification vitrimers with desirable Tg. A diverse vitrimer dataset is built for the first time from the ZINC15 database39. High-throughput MD simulations with a GP calibration model are employed to calculate Tg on a subset of vitrimers. The dataset is used to train a VAE model with dual graph encoders and decoders which enables representation and design of the desired vitrimer components. This further provides flexibility by exploring the latent space and optimizing latent vectors of different components for novel vitrimers. We demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of our framework in discovering novel vitrimers with three different targets of Tg even beyond the training distribution. The proposed vitrimers achieve both molecular variety and desirable To within 2 K range around the target, which make them ideal candidates for sustainable polymers for different applications. To validate our framework in experiments, we synthesize and characterize a novel vitrimer designed by the model. This vitrimer is proposed by optimizing acid-specific dimensions of latent vector while fixing epoxide as DGEBA. Driven by chemical intuition, we then slightly modify the proposed acids to a thermodynamically favorable derivative. The experimentally measured Tg (311 to 317 K) agrees well with the design target (323 K), which validates effectiveness of the VAE model. With slight adjustment to the VAE architecture and established computational methods to generate property data, the proposed framework can be extended to a wide range of properties (for example, Young's modulus, thermal conductivity, and topology freezing temperature) and other types of polymers. The complete workflow of computational design and experimental validation opens an opportunity for polymer scientists to achieve high-fidelity inverse design of multi-component polymeric materials with desirable properties.\n",

      "We perform MD simulations on 8,424 vitrimers sampled from the large dataset of one million to calculate their Tg. The simulations are conducted by Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS)1 and Polymer Consistent Force Field (PCFF)2 to describe the potential energy of atoms. PCFF has been applied to simulate the behavior of various polymeric systems including vitrimers3,4. We build the polymer chains in an alternating copolymer manner. For each vitrimer composition (i.e., one carboxylic acid molecule and one epoxide molecule), we connect the acid molecule and opened epoxide molecule alternately to form one vitrimer chain of around one thousand atoms. The reaction scheme is shown in Supplementary Figure 1a. Four of these chains are placed in a cubic simulation box with a density of 0.5 g/cm3 (Supplementary Figure 1b). The connection and placement of atoms in the simulation box are done by Enhanced Monte Carlo package5, which creates input structures for MD simulations using the Monte Carlo method with energetically favored orientations.\n",

      "The initial configuration is minimized using the conjugate gradient method and annealed to remove local heterogeneities. Specifically, the minimized structure is first relaxed under NVT ensemble (300 K) for 50 ps and under NPT ensemble (300 K and 1 atm) for 100 ps. We further heat the virtual specimen from 300 K to 800 K under NPT (1 atm) in 500 ps. The dimension of the simulation box is reduced and the density is taken to a realistic level after annealing. Two snapshots of the virtual specimens of an example vitrimer (adipic acid and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether) before and after annealing are presented in Supplementary Figure 1b. We hold the annealed system at 800 K for an additional 50 ps to obtain five independent specimens separated by 10 ps, which is proved to be sufficient to eliminate the effect of initial structures and ensure better statistics6. For production period, each of these specimens is cooled from 800 K to 100 K in a 10 K step. Each cooling step takes 25 ps under NPT followed by a 25-ps holding at constant temperature, during which the density is calculated as the average from 25 frames. We fit a bilinear regression to the density-temperature profile from 800 K to 100 K and the intersection point is defined as the TMD (Figure 2a in the manuscript). All TID results from five virtual specimens are averaged to reduce the uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of MD simulations. The distributions of mean MD-calculated TMD and coefficient of variation (i.e., mean divided by standard deviation) from five replicates of 8,424 vitrimers are presented in Supplementary Figure 2.\n",

      "To compensate for the overestimation in TMD due to the larger cooling rate compared with experiments, a calibration procedure is required. Afzal et al.7 calibrate TMD against experimental Tg by linear regression. However, we find it insufficient due to the effect of increased uncertainty associated with smaller systems in our simulations (Supplementary Figure 3c). Instead, we calibrate TMD from MD simulations against available experimental data in literature using a Gaussian process (GP) regression model. 2048-bit extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs)8 with radius 3 are used as input to the GP model to represent the repeating units of polymers. For vitrimers (i.e., combinations of carboxylic acids and epoxides), we obtain the repeating units by the reaction scheme depicted in Supplementary Figure 1a with n = 1.

      "We follow the hierarchical representation of molecules proposed by Jin et al. 12. A molecule G = (V, E) is preprocessed by decomposing it into n motifs (subgraphs) M1, ... , Mn using the following procedures. First, we identify all bonds between atom pair u and v with more than two connections and either u or v belongs to a ring. We then break all these bonds and convert G into a series of detached graphs. For each detached graph, if it appears more than a threshold frequency f during decomposition of all molecules in the training set, it is selected as a motif. Otherwise it is further decomposed into single rings and bonds (i.e., one bond with two atoms) which are selected as motifs. In this way, chemical validity is preserved and the union of all motifs covers the entire graph. We preprocess all molecules in the training set by the same procedures and a motif vocabulary VM is obtained. We empirically find that the VAE model works better when the motifs are constrained to single rings and bonds, i.e., f -> 00. This can be attributed to the fact that all molecules in the dataset are relatively small and limited to a maximum molecular weight of 500 g/mol. Larger motifs with more than one bonds can be used to accommodate larger molecules if necessary. Two vocabularies with sizes of 124 and 104 motifs are constructed for acid and epoxide molecules, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "We further represent G as a combination of hierarchical graphs at three levels (see Supplementary Figure 5 for a schematic illustration of the three-level hierarchical representation). The motif level GM captures how motifs M1, .... Mn are connected, i.e., GM = (VM, EM) with motifs as nodes and bonds connecting motifs as edges. In addition, the attachment level GA represents connection between motifs through shared atoms. Each node Ai = (Mi, {0}) at this level defines a connection site of M; with {v;} as all possible atoms shared by S; and its neighbors. Since the possible connection sites of Mi are finite, a vocabulary of attachment nodes VA(Mi) that depends on each motif Mi is constructed. Finally, the atom level G encodes the graph at the atomic level. Each node\n",
      "\n",
      "4/16\n",
      "\n",
      "is an atom and each edge is a bond of the molecule. This representation scheme captures necessary information of molecules at three levels with different resolutions and ensures chemical validity. As a result, the associative encoder and decoder can achieve accurate reconstruction and efficient generation of valid vitrimers in the VAE framework.\n",

We randomly sample a subset of 8,424 vitrimers from the whole dataset and calculate their Tg by MD simulations and GP calibration. A subset of 7,424 vitrimers is denoted as the labeled training set Dprop = {(Ga(i), Ge(i), T)) : i = 1, ... , 7424} and the rest 1,000 vitrimers constitute the test set Dtest. D and Dprop are used to train the VAE on a two-step basis (see Equation 6 and Equation 8 in the manuscript) and Dtest allows for evaluation of the reconstruction and property prediction capabilities on unseen data. The network dimensions and hyperparameters of the VAE framework are presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

Examples of ten vitrimers from the test set and their reconstructions are shown in Supplementary Figure 6. Two out of ten vitrimers are not successfully reconstructed due to mismatch of one of the components. Supplementary Figure 7 presents examples of 20 vitrimers sampled from the latent space based on standard Gaussian distribution. The three invalid vitrimers have chemically valid acids or epoxides which are not bifunctional. The predicted Tg by the property predictor is compared with calibrated Tg for 1,000 vitrimers in the test set, as shown in Supplementary Figure 8. A low MAE of 13.53 K indicates high accuracy of the trained property predictor. The distributions of latent vectors encoded from the labeled training set Dprop and test set Dtest after joint training are shown in Supplementary Figure 9a,b. Compare with the distributions before joint training (Supplementary Figure 9c,d), the gradient in Tg is much more recognizable, proving the effect of latent space organization by joint training the VAE with property predictor.\n",

Therefore, points along the linear interpolation path might leap across regions within the latent space that share similar molecular structures which results in irregular or unnatural interpolations. On the other hand, SLERP acknowledges the hyperspherical structure of the latent space and pursues the shortest arc on the surface of a d-dimensional hypersphere, thereby minimizing unrealistic transitions along the path. Supplementary Figure 10 shows the decoded vitrimers along SLERP and LERP paths, their locations in the latent space and Tg. Previous studies18, 19 have addressed the effectiveness of SLERP, which is more suitable for traversing between two locations in the latent space created by VAEs.\n",

      "We use the batch Bayesian optimization algorithm developed by Kusner et al.20. The workflow of Bayesian optimization is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 11. We start with 1,000 latent vectors z randomly sampled from standard Gaussian distribution and decode them into valid vitrimers. These vitrimers are then encoded into reconstructed latent vectors and their Tg is predicted by the property predictor. The predicted Tg is converted into the optimization objective, which is either -Tg (if the task is to find vitrimers with the maximum Tg) or the squared error between Tg and the target Tg (if the task is to find vitrimers with a target Tg). In each iteration, a sparse Gaussian process with 100 inducing points is trained as a surrogate model and 50 vitrimers are proposed by the expected improvement acquisition function. The valid vitrimers and their predicted Tg are added to the training set for next iteration. Ten independent runs each with 50 iterations are performed and all valid proposed vitrimers are collected. For each of the three design targets, we select 100 candidates with predicted Tg closest to the target that can be parameterized by PCFF, carry out MD simulations and calibrate MD-calculated TMD. The distributions of Tg of the designed vitrimers and the dataset are presented in Supplementary Figure 12. Ten best candidates with Tg closet to each target are presented in Supplementary Figure 13. Our framework succeeds in extrapolating beyond the training regime and achieves accurate inverse design within an error of 2 K.\n",
      "\n",
      "To examine the stability of vitrimers presented in Supplementary Figure 13, we minimize them under reactive force field (ReaxFF). ReaxFF is a molecular dynamics simulation technique that captures the instantaneous interactions between atoms using the bond order concept21. This strategy allows for a smooth transition between the non-bonded and bonded configurations and helps with the investigation of chemical reactions where bond formation and dissociation are involved. The proposed molecules remain intact during minimization using the CHON2017 weak bb force field22 and the minimized structures are presented in Supplementary Figure 14. We further calculate relevant molecular descriptors of these vitrimers, as shown in Supplementary Figure 15. Density is extracted from MD simulations at 300 K. All other descriptors are calculated by the Mordred package23. Each value is calculated from the repeating units (Supplementary Figure la with n = 1) and averaged over ten proposed vitrimers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We compare the Tg of the proposed vitrimers with commonly used polymers in Supplementary Figure 16. The vitrimers from inverse design cover a wide range of Tg from around 250 K to 550 K. With further tuning of the design target, our framework has the potential to discover vitrimers with any Tg within the range and greatly enhances the applicability of vitrimers at various temperatures.\n",

The first step involves mixing of succinic anhydride (1 mol) with glycerol (0.5 mol) at 130℃ for 1 hour to obtain a clear solution mixture of polymer with bifunctional carboxylic acid groups. In the second step, equivalent stoichiometric amount of DGEBA is added to the mixture in presence of catalyst triazabicyclodecene (TBD), which is further mixed at the same condition for 30 minutes to obtain a homogeneous slurry. The slurry is then transferred into a preheated Teflon taped mold at 145℃ and covered with top cover. The mold is placed into the heat press to continue the crosslinking at 145℃ for 6 hours followed by post curing for 2 hours at 180ºC.\n",

      "One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials. Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, as well as how to automatically develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Specifically, our pipeline for polymer property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations with a sizable 20% average reduction in prediction error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding periodicity into our polymer graph representation is responsible for a considerable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while achieving better predictive performance than human-derived features. Whereas previous polymer informatics have typically utilized hand-designed descriptors that have been optimized for representing molecules, this work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.\n",

      "The complex chemical structure of polymers provides chemists with an unprecedented level of chemical design opportunities. As a result, efforts focused on the rational design of polymers has led to their use in a remarkably wide range of applications.1,2 By varying a polymer's monomer structure, its propagation site, or the polymer chain length, the properties of the polymer can be tuned to suit the application of interest.3 6 Formulations of polymers with chemical additives adds an even richer potential design and functional space. However, efficiently navigating this vast chemical design space to identify promising polymer materials for a given application is incredibly challenging. Recently, the field of polymer informatics has shown much promise in tackling this challenge by utilizing machine learning (ML) models to learn the complex structure-property relationships of polymers.7,8 Through the development of increasingly accurate ML models, one can envision the future possibility of fully computational polymer design workflows whereby polymers can be rapidly designed in silico to satisfy multiple property criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate machine learning models require that the input to the model - be it an image, text, or chemical structure - is transformed into a machine-readable format that captures and represents all relevant features of the input. The development of suitable polymer representations to use as inputs for machine learning algorithms has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in the field of polymer informatics.9,10 Unlike molecules that consist of a fixed number of atoms and typically only contain dozens of atoms, a given polymer can consist of a periodic chain of between 100-106 repeating chemical sub-units.11\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents a considerable challenge for creating machine-readable polymer representations since they must encode the periodic nature of the polymer structure and also be compact enough to represent up to millions of atoms. Despite these challenges, previous work on small molecules and crystalline solids has demonstrated that developing physically-inspired representations of atomistic systems is a fruitful direction towards realizing significant improvements in property prediction accuracy.12-15\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we develop a new polymer representation that is the first to explicitly capture the periodic nature of polymeric materials. First, we show that the widely used monomer-based representations cannot sufficiently describe the periodic, extended structure of polymers and can result in unreliable property predictions. To solve this issue, we have developed a novel polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph and that naturally incorporates polymers' periodicity in its construction. Across a diverse spectrum of 10 unique polymer properties, we find that our polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous monomer-based representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction error. Finally, we demonstrate how our polymer graph representations can be combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework to automatically extract chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from a dataset of polymer properties. We find that these MPNN-learned polymer features yield more accurate property predictions than predetermined features that have been hand-crafted by chemists over years.\n",

      "Recently, a wide range of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately predict polymer properties in an a priori manner.16,17 These previous approaches typically represent polymers by their monomer repeat unit which is then converted into either i) molecular descriptors that includes the presence of molecular fragments and/or property descriptors (such as the molecular weight of the molecule)18-20 or ii) a molecular graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds are represented as edges (Figure 1a)).17 It should be noted that these representations were first developed for molecules before being transferred to the field of polymer informatics. Although these monomer-based representations perform well at representing finite molecules, we show in this work that monomer-based representations cannot adequately represent the extended chain structures that define polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using monomer-based representations as inputs for ML algorithms results in at least three notable issues: i) the generation of non-unique representations for polymers that are composed of the similar monomer repeat units (see \"monomer graphs\" of Polymer A and B in Figure 1 c), ii) incorrect bonding environment of the polymer, and iii) a lack of periodicity. Polymers A and B in Figure 1c) are two distinct polymers with notably different chemical structures and properties. Since the monomer of a polymer is defined as the smallest repeat unit of the polymer chain, the monomer of the two polymers in Figure 1 c) is therefore the same C-C-O subunit (or CH3 CH2OH if including hydrogen atoms). Regardless of the specific details of the featurization used, generating a representation of Polymer A and B based only on their monomers will result in two identical representations (see Supplementary Note 1). In turn, an ML algorithm that then uses these representations to learn a structure-property relationship will, at best, only be able to learn the average value of the property across the polymers, which may lead to large prediction errors. The second issue that will arise from the use of monomer-based representations is the incorrect featurization of the polymer. Polymer B consists of a repeating (-C-C-O-) backbone, which is characterized by an ether functional group (R-O-R, where R is any alkane). However, the monomer of Polymer B ( C-C-O) does not contain an ether functional group since this ether group is artificially fragmented when forming the monomer representation. This is particularly problematic since both fingerprinting approaches and property descriptors utilize the presence of functional groups and connectivity in their representations (Supplementary Note 1).21-23 Thirdly, the failure to include periodicity in these monomer-based representations results in representations that are inconsistent due to trivial translations along the polymer backbone. The polymer (-C-C-O-)n can also be written as (-C-O-C-)n by translating all atoms one position along the polymer chain. However, the monomer representations for these two equivalent polymer representations would be C-C-O and C-O-C, respectively. As shown in this example, the failure to explicitly account for periodicity in these monomer-based representations can result in inconsistent featurizations, which can negatively impact the ability of ML algorithms to learn the underlying structure-property relationships. These inconsistent featurizations are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1.\n",

      "Fundamentally, all three of the aforementioned problems arise due to a failure to account for the periodic nature of polymers. In other words, a finite molecule (i.e. a monomer) cannot be used to represent a continuous, extended chain of atoms without fragmenting chemical bonds in an unphysical manner. We note that featurizing Polymers A and B by generating dimers (or any larger oligomer chain) instead of monomers results in unique representations. Using a dimer representation, however, still results in incorrect featurizations due to the incomplete bonding environment of the atoms at the terminal end of the dimer.\n",

      "In this work, we introduce a new polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph that solves all three of these problems. The core idea of the polymer graph is that adding a bond between the two terminal ends of the polymer chain creates a periodic polymer representation (Figure 1b)). The periodic nature of this representation eliminates the need for artificially cleaving chemical bonds, ensuring that the correct bonding environment is maintained for all atoms in the polymer. We note that this approach is strongly reminiscent of the crystal graph representations that has had wide success in representing periodic crystalline materials that extend indefinitely in all three dimensions.12 Crystal graph representations have solved the problem of representing an infinite 3-D crystal by treating it as the smallest repeat unit (referred to as the unit cell) that then transmits chemical information by interacting with periodic copies of itself in all directions. In an analogous fashion, the polymer graph developed in this work is formed from the repeat unit of the polymer that is able to transmit chemical information through the added periodic bond. We emphasize that this periodic bond is used only for representing the polymer, but should not be interpreted to mean that the polymers are always part of a chemical ring system.\n",

      "Graph-based representations of molecules and crystalline solids have recently been the subject of considerable research efforts and are currently the state-of-the-art representation for predicting the properties of these systems. 13,24,25 Generally these graphs represent each atom in the chemical system, i, by an atom embedding vector (hi) which is updated through messages that are sent through the edges of the graph. These update messages typically operate on all atoms and bonds in the local neighbor- hood of atom i, where the local neighborhood is given by the edges of the graph that are connected to atom i. To generate our polymer graph representation, we first create a standard trimer graph and then add an additional edge to connect the two terminal atoms of the trimer (Figure 1 b)). This added edge in our polymer graph representation not only maintains the correct bonding environment for all atoms, but also serves to ensure that messages (i.e. chemical information) can be sent throughout the polymer graph. For example, the left-most carbon atom in the monomer graph in Figure 1a) will only directly receive messages from the central carbon atom since this is the only atom that it is bonded to. This is not an accurate representation of the true chemical structure of this polymer since this carbon atom is directly bonded to both a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. On the other hand, since our polymer graph representation creates an edge between the terminal carbon and oxygen atoms, messages are directly passed between both of these two atoms, thus allowing the atom embedding vector of the terminal carbon atom to more accurately represent its true chemical environment. We construct the polymer graph from a trimer graph (rather than a dimer or monomer graph) to ensure that the added periodic bond is between atoms that are distinct and not already bonded to each other.\n",

      "To demonstrate the accuracy and generality of our polymer graph representation for predicting polymer properties, we collect a dataset of polymer properties containing 15,219 datapoints across 10 distinct properties (see Methods for dataset details). Notably, this dataset includes a diverse set of property types (thermal, structural, optical, electronic) as well as data collected from both experimental and computational sources, which allows us to assess the capability of our approach to learn meaningful polymer representations for general property prediction tasks. To perform a baseline comparison, we also train ML models on all 10 properties with two commonly used monomer-based representations: i) molecular descriptors and ii) molecular graphs of the monomer (Table 1). All graph-based models are trained with a MPNN model, whereas a random forest (RF) model is used for training with the monomer descriptors (see Methods for model architecture and hyperparameter details).\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing the performance of the RF/Molecular Descriptors and the MPNN/Monomer Graph in Table 1 illustrates the increase in performance that is realized when using graph-based models for polymer property prediction. Across 8 out of 10 properties, the MPNN/Monomer graph model outperforms the RF/Molecular Descriptors model. On average, the MPNN/Monomer Graph model achieves 12 % lower error than the RF/Molecular Descriptors model, with remarkably large reductions in error for predicting atomization energy (43%), band gap bulk (17%), and electron affinity (32%). Both models perform similarly at predicting ionization energy, whereas the RF/Molecular Descriptors model performs slightly better only at predicting the crystallization tendency. The poor performance of the monomer graph model for predicting crystallization tendency may be due to the fact that these values were calculated with the use of an approximate group contribution method.26 The low fidelity of this dataset may therefore be preventing the graph model from learning reasonable atom/bond features for predicting crystallization tendency. Based on the results across all properties, we conclude that graph-based models can generally be expected to perform, at worst, comparably to RF/Molecular Descriptor models, with the potential to perform significantly better on certain properties. This finding is in agreement with a previous report which showed that monomer graph-based models outperform ECFP molecular descriptors for predicting the glass transition temperature, melting temperature, density, and elastic modulus for a subclass of polymers known as polyamides.17 In the present work, we expand this finding to show that graph-based models can generally be expected to outperform models based on molecular descriptors across a broader range of polymer properties and for datasets that contain all subclasses of polymers.\n",

      "Now that we have demonstrated the ability of graph-based models to perform well at predicting polymer properties, we now explore how the construction of the graph itself can influence model performance. Table 1 illustrates the performance of monomer graph and polymer graph representations with the same MPNN model. Although we have already demonstrated that the MPNN/Monomer Graph model considerably outperforms the current state-of-the-art RF/Molecular Descriptor models, we find that using our polymer graph representation results in a further 10% average reduction in error compared to the monomer graph model and does not perform significantly worse than the monomer graph model for any of the properties. The polymer graph representation results in a significant reduction in error for predicting atomization error (33%), band gap chain (15%), ionization energy (19%) and glass transition temperature (10%), compared to the monomer graph representation. Since the improvement in property prediction accuracy achieved by the polymer graph is highly property-dependant, we note that the 10% average reduction in error reported here is likely to vary depending on the chosen set of properties of interest. Nevertheless, we do not find any properties where the polymer graph performs significantly worse than the monomer graph representation, leading us to conclude that the polymer graph should be expected to yield more accurate property predictions across a wide range of properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our original hypothesis to motivate the development of our polymer graph representation was that it can improve over monomer graph representations by being able to distinguish between polymers that have the same monomer representation. To test this idea, we construct a test set of 179 glass transition temperature (Tg) datapoints where each polymer in the dataset has at least one other polymer that contains the same monomer representation, as depicted by polymers A-C in Figure 2. We train a MPNN/Monomer Graph model and a MPNN/Polymer Graph model on a Tg training set that does not include these 179 polymers and then evaluate their ability to predict the Tg of the 179 polymers in the test set. This experiment therefore allows us to quantify the impact on prediction accuracy that results from the inability of monomer graphs to distinguish between polymers that have the same monomer representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As illustrated in Figure 2, the inability of the MPNN/Monomer graph model to distinguish between polymers A-C results in the same Tg prediction for all three polymers. Since the experimental Tg value varies largely between these three polymers, this results in an unacceptably large prediction error of over 60℃. Although polymers A-C are chosen as an illustrative example, a more statistically significant comparison can be obtained from the performance on the entire test set of 179 polymers. Consistent with our original hypothesis, we see that the inability of the monomer graph representation to distinguish between the polymers in this test set results in significantly worse performance when compared to Table 1 (49°C vs. 39℃). On the other hand, the polymer graph representation is not only able to distinguish between these polymers, but also quantitatively capture the trends in Tg values for polymers A-C with a RMSE that is nearly 60% less than that of the monomer graph. These results therefore\n",

By being able to distinguish between polymers of the same monomer structure, the polymer graph representation is therefore better able to learn quantitative structure-property relationships for the properties in Table 1. Since the proportion of polymers that have the same monomer structure is relatively small ( 2% of the Tg dataset), we anticipate that this effect is currently small, but will grow in importance as more polymers are discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of the experiment shown in Figure 2 also have important practical implications for the reliability that can be expected when using ML methods to discover new polymers. The Tg of a polymer is the temperature at which the thermal motions of the polymers are large enough to overcome the forces that hold the amorphous polymer together, such that the polymer is able to undergo large-scale molecular motions.27 Accurately predicting the glass transition temperature is therefore of great importance since Tg is often treated as the maximum temperature that the polymer can be used.28 Despite having identical chemical compositions, the three polymers shown in Figure 2 exhibit a remarkably broad range of experimental Tg values due to their unique chemical structures. In particular, the presence of the hydroxyl (OH) group on Polymer A leads to an increase in interchain attractive forces, resulting in a significantly larger Tg value than for Polymers B and C.29 The inability of monomer-based graph representations to distinguish between these polymers therefore severely hurts the trustworthiness of the model. If one were to use the MPNN/Monomer Graph model to discover new polymers, the large errors in this subset of Tg predictions could manifest in the discovery of polymers that are thermodynamically unstable at the desired operating temperature. By comparison, the consistent performance seen by the MPNN/Polymer Graph model helps to instill confidence that the predictions will be robust across a large dataset of polymer materials.\n",

      "Although the results in Table 1 and Figure 2 suggest that the polymer graph representation can more accurately predict polymer properties than both the monomer graph and molecular descriptor representations, they do not fully explain what is causing this improvement in performance. Understanding specifically how polymer representation can impact predictive performance is important for the development of increasingly better polymer representations. To accomplish this goal, we perform several ablation experiments whereby we systematically alter components of the polymer graph representation to allow us to quantify the contribution of each component to overall model performance (Figure 3). We conduct this experiment by training the same MPNN model as before on the same 10 properties listed in Table 1. For clarity, we illustrate the performance of each representation by calculating the average performance across all properties (Figure 3).

This result is perhaps unsurprising since the trimer graph does not provide any additional chemical information compared to the dimer graph representation. Based on this finding, we anticipate that using even larger graph representations (i.e. tetramer or pentamer) will not improve model performance, but will unnecessarily require more computational resources for model training. Finally, comparing the performance of the dimer graph and the monomer graph representations illustrates that including more than one repeat unit in the graph significantly improves performance. It may seem counter-intuitive that the trimer graph and dimer graph representations perform similarly, whereas dimer graph representations considerably outperform monomer graph representations. However, this result can be explained by noting that the dimer graph representation contains additional chemical bonding information, relative to the monomer graph, since it directly represents the atoms that are bonded together to form the polymer chain. On the other hand, the trimer/dimer graph representations do not differ in the chemical information that they contain, but are simply scaled versions of each other.\n",

      "We note from the ablation experiments illustrated in Figure 3 that the largest reduction in error relative to the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline is due to using graph-based representations with the MPNN model. Using graph-based models results in at least a 13% average reduction in error, relative to the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline, whereas further refinements to the graph representation only affects the average performance by approximately 3-5%. To better understand why using graph-based representations in combination with a MPNN architecture leads to such a significant performance improvement, we analyze the learned feature vectors that are generated from the MPNN model. The MPNN model utilized in this work uses learned bond and atom features that are aggregated into a single fixed-length vector. This aggregated vector is then passed through a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers to generate the final property prediction. As a result, the vector in the final hidden layer of this feed-forward neural network can be considered as a learned encoding of the polymer that has been optimized by the MPNN model to make accurate property predictions. These vector encodings can therefore be analyzed to determine what chemical information the MPNN model is using to generate its predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline used previously (Table 1) utilizes pre-determined molecular descriptors (such as molecular weight), the vector encodings extracted from our MPNN model are vector representations that have been specifically optimized for the particular property that they are trained on. Comparing the performance of the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline and a RF model trained with these learned encodings therefore allows us to quantitatively understand if the superior performance of the graph-based models are due to these optimized encodings or the MPNN model architecture. To perform this experiment, we train the MPNN model on k-1 folds (k=5) of the Tg dataset. This trained MPNN model is then used to generate vector encodings for the polymers in the same k-1 folds of the dataset. Then, these vector encodings are used as inputs to train the RF model on the same k-1 folds of the dataset that the MPNN model was trained on. Finally, the test performance of the RF model is calculated for the remaining fold of the dataset that was not seen by the MPNN model nor the RF model in training. This procedure is repeated for k iterations to ensure that each fold of the dataset is used as the test set once and the reported performance is averaged across these k iterations. This training procedure prevents data leakage by ensuring that the test set is not seen by the MPNN model or the RF model before determining test performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of this experiment are given in Figure 4a). Remarkably, we find that the RF model with learned descriptors performs comparably to the MPNN/Polymer Graph model at predicting Tg. This result suggests that the excellent performance of the MPNN/Polymer Graph model is not due to MPNNs being a more powerful model architecture. Rather, the learned descriptors that the MPNN model extracts provides a more meaningful representation of polymers, leading to superior predictive capability. This finding is exciting because it suggests that the use of learned polymer representations that better capture the underlying chemical properties of polymers can lead to greatly improved predictive capabilities, even with relatively simple model architectures like random forests. It is important to note that the predetermined molecular descriptors that have been previously used for polymer prediction tasks were first developed as general descriptors for molecules, but with no guarantee that these descriptors will contain properties that are relevant for describing polymer properties.21 On the other hand, these learned MPNN descriptors are specifically trained to capture the relevant components of a polymer's structure that give rise to its properties. In this way, the MPNN model explored in this work provides a recipe for automatically extracting meaningful polymer representations directly from polymer property datasets in a manner that does not require any hand-crafted featurization.\n",

      "layer of the MPNN/Polymer Graph model and the predetermined molecular descriptors for the polymers in the Tg dataset. The 5 molecular descriptors that are most correlated with the MPNN learned features for the MPNN/Polymer Graph model are depicted in Figure 4b). Two of the most important known structural features for predicting Tg in polymers is: i) the presence of polar functional groups such as NH2 and OH that increase intermolecular forces, resulting in a higher Tg value and ii) the stiffness of the polymer chain, which is typically described in terms of the presence of rigid ring structures in the polymer backbone.27 The molecular descriptors shown in Figure 4b) are colored according to which one of these two known structural factors they explicitly capture. Interestingly, we see that the majority of the learned MPNN features are strongly correlated with these known relevant chemical features, which suggests that our MPNN model is autonomously learning the chemical features that are responsible for Tg directly from the dataset of Tg values. In particular, the most heavily weighted MPNN feature is correlated with the presence of polar groups, whereas the other top 5 features provide complex descriptions of the presence of ring structures in the polymer. However, we emphasize that these MPNN polymer encodings also contain new information that is not captured by the predetermined descriptors, as is shown by the superior performance of the RF model when using learned descriptors instead of predetermined descriptors (Figure 4a).\n",

      "Generally, this work has demonstrated how the development of representations that better account for the unique and complex chemical structure of polymers can be a powerful strategy for increasing the accuracy of polymer property predictions. Through a number of illustrative examples, we have demonstrated how a failure to account for periodicity in polymers can lead to property predictions that are inaccurate and unreliable. We have shown that these issues can be mitigated by our novel polymer graph representation that explicitly accounts for the inherent periodicity of polymeric materials. The results presented here therefore demonstrate that utilizing chemical intuition to construct physically-informed polymer representations is a viable strategy for advancing the predictive capabilities of ML models.\n",

      "The polymer informatics community has benefited greatly from the adaptation of machine learning algorithms and representations that were first developed for molecules. This approach is based on the assumption that general molecular descriptors are likely to work well across a broad spectrum of chemical classes, including polymers. In this work, we test this assumption by exploring the improvement in property predictions that can be achieved through the use of learned descriptors that are specifically optimized to capture the unique structural characteristics of polymers. We have shown that utilizing polymer-specific descriptors results in considerable improvements in the accuracy of polymer property predictions, compared to standard molecular descriptors. These results suggest that the structural characteristics that give rise to polymer properties are distinct from general molecular descriptors. This is perhaps unsurprising since it is well known that polymers are affected by structural elements that do not have molecular analogues, such as the branching structure of the polymer or its interchain interactions. We anticipate that the continued development of representations that are customized to capture the unique and complex structure of polymeric systems is therefore a fruitful direction for further pushing the limits of predicting polymer properties with ML.\n",

For each property, any features that have a constant value across the whole dataset are removed prior to training. The molecular descriptors are generated from the monomer SMILES string of the polymer that has the '*' characters removed.

      "The Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) used in this work is implemented in the Chemprop package.13 Notably, this network utilizes directed bond-level messages (rather than the atom-level messages used in traditional MPNNs) to transmit chemical information across the molecule. This network architecture operates on input molecular graphs to first generate a vector encoding of the graph, followed by a feed-forward neural network that converts the graph encodings into property predictions. The size of the bond message vectors is set to 300 and a total of 3 message-passing steps are used. The feed-forward neural network consists of 2 hidden layers, each consisting of 300 hidden neurons. All hyperparameters used are the Chemprop default values. We point interested readers to the Chemprop documentation for an extensive list of all hyperparameters used in this architecture.13 Unless otherwise stated, all models are trained with 5-fold cross-validation (CV) for 50 epochs on each fold. The best-performing model is chosen by selecting the model with the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) performance on the validation set. The Random Forest (RF) model was implemented in scikit-learn version 0.24.1 with 500 trees.31\n",

      "To illustrate the inconsistencies that arise when using preexisting molecular descriptors to represent polymers, Figure S1 provides a visualize of the molecular descriptors generated from RDKit for 4 representative SMILES strings. According to the syntax of the SMILES strings, the '*' character is used to indicate the connection between repeating units of a polymer. The SMILES notation also does not explicitly indicate hydrogen atoms, but instead assumes that all atoms have the number of hydrogen atoms required for full valency. The '*CCO*' SMILES string therefore represents a (-CH2-CH2-O-)n polymer and the '*COC*' SMILES string represents the same polymer, (-CH2-O-CH2-)n, that has been trivially translated along the polymer backbone. Even though '*CCO*' and '*COC*' represent the same polymer, Figure S1 illustrates the different feature vectors that are generated from these SMILES strings. An understanding of why this difference arises can be obtained by looking at the molecular fragment features that are generated for these two SMILES string. The only difference in the molecular fragment features is the 'fr_ether' feature, which is a binary feature that indicates the presence of an ether functional group. As shown in Figure S1, the '*CCO*' has fr_ether=0 (indicating the absence of an ether), whereas '*COC*' has fr_ether=1 (indicating the presence of an ether). Evidently, the inconsistent featurization between these two chemically identical SMILES strings is due to a lack of periodicity. Since the '*CCO*' SMILES string does not treat the terminal oxygen atom as being bonded to two neighboring carbon atoms, using the '*CCO*' SMILES string results in an incorrect featurization of fr_ether=0, when this polymer does in fact contain an ether.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of including the '*' character in the SMILES representation is illustrated with feature vectors of the 'CCO' and 'COC' SMILES strings, which are the monomer subunits of '*CCO*' and '*COC*', respectively. Interestingly, all four of these inputs yield four different feature vectors. Although these inconsistencies could be accounted for by designating a standardized SMILES string to use as an input for a given polymer, it is unlikely that such a standardized system would always capture the correct periodicity of the polymer. Instead, the use of the polymer graph representation as described in the main text ensures that the periodicity of the polymer is maintained and always generates a consistent representation.\n",

      "One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials. Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, as well as how to automatically develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Specifically, our pipeline for polymer property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations with a sizable 20% average reduction in prediction error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding periodicity into our polymer graph representation is responsible for a considerable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while achieving better predictive performance than human-derived features. Whereas previous polymer informatics have typically utilized hand-designed descriptors that have been optimized for representing molecules, this work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.\n",

      "The complex chemical structure of polymers provides chemists with an unprecedented level of chemical design opportunities. As a result, efforts focused on the rational design of polymers has led to their use in a remarkably wide range of applications.1,2 By varying a polymer's monomer structure, its propagation site, or the polymer chain length, the properties of the polymer can be tuned to suit the application of interest.3 6 Formulations of polymers with chemical additives adds an even richer potential design and functional space. However, efficiently navigating this vast chemical design space to identify promising polymer materials for a given application is incredibly challenging. Recently, the field of polymer informatics has shown much promise in tackling this challenge by utilizing machine learning (ML) models to learn the complex structure-property relationships of polymers.7,8 Through the development of increasingly accurate ML models, one can envision the future possibility of fully computational polymer design workflows whereby polymers can be rapidly designed in silico to satisfy multiple property criteria.\n",

      "Accurate machine learning models require that the input to the model - be it an image, text, or chemical structure - is transformed into a machine-readable format that captures and represents all relevant features of the input. The development of suitable polymer representations to use as inputs for machine learning algorithms has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in the field of polymer informatics.9,10 Unlike molecules that consist of a fixed number of atoms and typically only contain dozens of atoms, a given polymer can consist of a periodic chain of between 100-106 repeating chemical sub-units.11\n",

Despite these challenges, previous work on small molecules and crystalline solids has demonstrated that developing physically-inspired representations of atomistic systems is a fruitful direction towards realizing significant improvements in property prediction accuracy.12-15\n",

      "In this work, we develop a new polymer representation that is the first to explicitly capture the periodic nature of polymeric materials. First, we show that the widely used monomer-based representations cannot sufficiently describe the periodic, extended structure of polymers and can result in unreliable property predictions. To solve this issue, we have developed a novel polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph and that naturally incorporates polymers' periodicity in its construction. Across a diverse spectrum of 10 unique polymer properties, we find that our polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous monomer-based representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction error. Finally, we demonstrate how our polymer graph representations can be combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework to automatically extract chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from a dataset of polymer properties. We find that these MPNN-learned polymer features yield more accurate property predictions than predetermined features that have been hand-crafted by chemists over years.\n",

      "Recently, a wide range of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately predict polymer properties in an a priori manner.16,17 These previous approaches typically represent polymers by their monomer repeat unit which is then converted into either i) molecular descriptors that includes the presence of molecular fragments and/or property descriptors (such as the molecular weight of the molecule)18-20 or ii) a molecular graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds are represented as edges (Figure 1a)).17 It should be noted that these representations were first developed for molecules before being transferred to the field of polymer informatics. Although these monomer-based representations perform well at representing finite molecules, we show in this work that monomer-based representations cannot adequately represent the extended chain structures that define polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using monomer-based representations as inputs for ML algorithms results in at least three notable issues: i) the generation of non-unique representations for polymers that are composed of the similar monomer repeat units (see \"monomer graphs\" of Polymer A and B in Figure 1 c), ii) incorrect bonding environment of the polymer, and iii) a lack of periodicity. Polymers A and B in Figure 1c) are two distinct polymers with notably different chemical structures and properties. Since the monomer of a polymer is defined as the smallest repeat unit of the polymer chain, the monomer of the two polymers in Figure 1 c) is therefore the same C-C-O subunit (or CH3 CH2OH if including hydrogen atoms). Regardless of the specific details of the featurization used, generating a representation of Polymer A and B based only on their monomers will result in two identical representations (see Supplementary Note 1). In turn, an ML algorithm that then uses these representations to learn a structure-property relationship will, at best, only be able to learn the average value of the property across the polymers, which may lead to large prediction errors. The second issue that will arise from the use of monomer-based representations is the incorrect featurization of the polymer. Polymer B consists of a repeating (-C-C-O-) backbone, which is characterized by an ether functional group (R-O-R, where R is any alkane). However, the monomer of Polymer B ( C-C-O) does not contain an ether functional group since this ether group is artificially fragmented when forming the monomer representation. This is particularly problematic since both fingerprinting approaches and property descriptors utilize the presence of functional groups and connectivity in their representations (Supplementary Note 1).21-23 Thirdly, the failure to include periodicity in these monomer-based representations results in representations that are inconsistent due to trivial translations along the polymer backbone. The polymer (-C-C-O-)n can also be written as (-C-O-C-)n by translating all atoms one position along the polymer chain. However, the monomer representations for these two equivalent polymer representations would be C-C-O and C-O-C, respectively. As shown in this example, the failure to explicitly account for periodicity in these monomer-based representations can result in inconsistent featurizations, which can negatively impact the ability of ML algorithms to learn the underlying structure-property relationships. These inconsistent featurizations are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamentally, all three of the aforementioned problems arise due to a failure to account for the periodic nature of polymers. In other words, a finite molecule (i.e. a monomer) cannot be used to represent a continuous, extended chain of atoms without fragmenting chemical bonds in an unphysical manner. We note that featurizing Polymers A and B by generating dimers (or any larger oligomer chain) instead of monomers results in unique representations. Using a dimer representation, however, still results in incorrect featurizations due to the incomplete bonding environment of the atoms at the terminal end of the dimer.\n",

      "In this work, we introduce a new polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph that solves all three of these problems. The core idea of the polymer graph is that adding a bond between the two terminal ends of the polymer chain creates a periodic polymer representation (Figure 1b)). The periodic nature of this representation eliminates the need for artificially cleaving chemical bonds, ensuring that the correct bonding environment is maintained for all atoms in the polymer. We note that this approach is strongly reminiscent of the crystal graph representations that has had wide success in representing periodic crystalline materials that extend indefinitely in all three dimensions.12 Crystal graph representations have solved the problem of representing an infinite 3-D crystal by treating it as the smallest repeat unit (referred to as the unit cell) that then transmits chemical information by interacting with periodic copies of itself in all directions. In an analogous fashion, the polymer graph developed in this work is formed from the repeat unit of the polymer that is able to transmit chemical information through the added periodic bond. We emphasize that this periodic bond is used only for representing the polymer, but should not be interpreted to mean that the polymers are always part of a chemical ring system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph-based representations of molecules and crystalline solids have recently been the subject of considerable research efforts and are currently the state-of-the-art representation for predicting the properties of these systems. 13,24,25 Generally these graphs represent each atom in the chemical system, i, by an atom embedding vector (hi) which is updated through messages that are sent through the edges of the graph. These update messages typically operate on all atoms and bonds in the local neighbor- hood of atom i, where the local neighborhood is given by the edges of the graph that are connected to atom i. To generate our polymer graph representation, we first create a standard trimer graph and then add an additional edge to connect the two terminal atoms of the trimer (Figure 1 b)). This added edge in our polymer graph representation not only maintains the correct bonding environment for all atoms, but also serves to ensure that messages (i.e. chemical information) can be sent throughout the polymer graph. For example, the left-most carbon atom in the monomer graph in Figure 1a) will only directly receive messages from the central carbon atom since this is the only atom that it is bonded to. This is not an accurate representation of the true chemical structure of this polymer since this carbon atom is directly bonded to both a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. On the other hand, since our polymer graph representation creates an edge between the terminal carbon and oxygen atoms, messages are directly passed between both of these two atoms, thus allowing the atom embedding vector of the terminal carbon atom to more accurately represent its true chemical environment. We construct the polymer graph from a trimer graph (rather than a dimer or monomer graph) to ensure that the added periodic bond is between atoms that are distinct and not already bonded to each other.\n",

      "To demonstrate the accuracy and generality of our polymer graph representation for predicting polymer properties, we collect a dataset of polymer properties containing 15,219 datapoints across 10 distinct properties (see Methods for dataset details). Notably, this dataset includes a diverse set of property types (thermal, structural, optical, electronic) as well as data collected from both experimental and computational sources, which allows us to assess the capability of our approach to learn meaningful polymer representations for general property prediction tasks. To perform a baseline comparison, we also train ML models on all 10 properties with two commonly used monomer-based representations: i) molecular descriptors and ii) molecular graphs of the monomer (Table 1). All graph-based models are trained with a MPNN model, whereas a random forest (RF) model is used for training with the monomer descriptors (see Methods for model architecture and hyperparameter details).\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing the performance of the RF/Molecular Descriptors and the MPNN/Monomer Graph in Table 1 illustrates the increase in performance that is realized when using graph-based models for polymer property prediction. Across 8 out of 10 properties, the MPNN/Monomer graph model outperforms the RF/Molecular Descriptors model. On average, the MPNN/Monomer Graph model achieves 12 % lower error than the RF/Molecular Descriptors model, with remarkably large reductions in error for predicting atomization energy (43%), band gap bulk (17%), and electron affinity (32%). Both models perform similarly at predicting ionization energy, whereas the RF/Molecular Descriptors model performs slightly better only at predicting the crystallization tendency. The poor performance of the monomer graph model for predicting crystallization tendency may be due to the fact that these values were calculated with the use of an approximate group contribution method.26 The low fidelity of this dataset may therefore be preventing the graph model from learning reasonable atom/bond features for predicting crystallization tendency. Based on the results across all properties, we conclude that graph-based models can generally be expected to perform, at worst, comparably to RF/Molecular Descriptor models, with the potential to perform significantly better on certain properties. This finding is in agreement with a previous report which showed that monomer graph-based models outperform ECFP molecular descriptors for predicting the glass transition temperature, melting temperature, density, and elastic modulus for a subclass of polymers known as polyamides.17 In the present work, we expand this finding to show that graph-based models can generally be expected to outperform models based on molecular descriptors across a broader range of polymer properties and for datasets that contain all subclasses of polymers.\n",

      "Now that we have demonstrated the ability of graph-based models to perform well at predicting polymer properties, we now explore how the construction of the graph itself can influence model performance. Table 1 illustrates the performance of monomer graph and polymer graph representations with the same MPNN model. Although we have already demonstrated that the MPNN/Monomer Graph model considerably outperforms the current state-of-the-art RF/Molecular Descriptor models, we find that using our polymer graph representation results in a further 10% average reduction in error compared to the monomer graph model and does not perform significantly worse than the monomer graph model for any of the properties. The polymer graph representation results in a significant reduction in error for predicting atomization error (33%), band gap chain (15%), ionization energy (19%) and glass transition temperature (10%), compared to the monomer graph representation. Since the improvement in property prediction accuracy achieved by the polymer graph is highly property-dependant, we note that the 10% average reduction in error reported here is likely to vary depending on the chosen set of properties of interest. Nevertheless, we do not find any properties where the polymer graph performs significantly worse than the monomer graph representation, leading us to conclude that the polymer graph should be expected to yield more accurate property predictions across a wide range of properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our original hypothesis to motivate the development of our polymer graph representation was that it can improve over monomer graph representations by being able to distinguish between polymers that have the same monomer representation. To test this idea, we construct a test set of 179 glass transition temperature (Tg) datapoints where each polymer in the dataset has at least one other polymer that contains the same monomer representation, as depicted by polymers A-C in Figure 2. We train a MPNN/Monomer Graph model and a MPNN/Polymer Graph model on a Tg training set that does not include these 179 polymers and then evaluate their ability to predict the Tg of the 179 polymers in the test set. This experiment therefore allows us to quantify the impact on prediction accuracy that results from the inability of monomer graphs to distinguish between polymers that have the same monomer representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As illustrated in Figure 2, the inability of the MPNN/Monomer graph model to distinguish between polymers A-C results in the same Tg prediction for all three polymers. Since the experimental Tg value varies largely between these three polymers, this results in an unacceptably large prediction error of over 60℃. Although polymers A-C are chosen as an illustrative example, a more statistically significant comparison can be obtained from the performance on the entire test set of 179 polymers. Consistent with our original hypothesis, we see that the inability of the monomer graph representation to distinguish between the polymers in this test set results in significantly worse performance when compared to Table 1 (49°C vs. 39℃). On the other hand, the polymer graph representation is not only able to distinguish between these polymers, but also quantitatively capture the trends in Tg values for polymers A-C with a RMSE that is nearly 60% less than that of the monomer graph.

By being able to distinguish between polymers of the same monomer structure, the polymer graph representation is therefore better able to learn quantitative structure-property relationships for the properties in Table 1. Since the proportion of polymers that have the same monomer structure is relatively small ( 2% of the Tg dataset), we anticipate that this effect is currently small, but will grow in importance as more polymers are discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of the experiment shown in Figure 2 also have important practical implications for the reliability that can be expected when using ML methods to discover new polymers. The Tg of a polymer is the temperature at which the thermal motions of the polymers are large enough to overcome the forces that hold the amorphous polymer together, such that the polymer is able to undergo large-scale molecular motions.27 Accurately predicting the glass transition temperature is therefore of great importance since Tg is often treated as the maximum temperature that the polymer can be used.28 Despite having identical chemical compositions, the three polymers shown in Figure 2 exhibit a remarkably broad range of experimental Tg values due to their unique chemical structures. In particular, the presence of the hydroxyl (OH) group on Polymer A leads to an increase in interchain attractive forces, resulting in a significantly larger Tg value than for Polymers B and C.29 The inability of monomer-based graph representations to distinguish between these polymers therefore severely hurts the trustworthiness of the model. If one were to use the MPNN/Monomer Graph model to discover new polymers, the large errors in this subset of Tg predictions could manifest in the discovery of polymers that are thermodynamically unstable at the desired operating temperature. By comparison, the consistent performance seen by the MPNN/Polymer Graph model helps to instill confidence that the predictions will be robust across a large dataset of polymer materials.\n",

Understanding specifically how polymer representation can impact predictive performance is important for the development of increasingly better polymer representations. To accomplish this goal, we perform several ablation experiments whereby we systematically alter components of the polymer graph representation to allow us to quantify the contribution of each component to overall model performance (Figure 3). We conduct this experiment by training the same MPNN model as before on the same 10 properties listed in Table 1. For clarity, we illustrate the performance of each representation by calculating the average performance across all properties (Figure 3). The property-specific performance of each representation is given in Table S1.\n",

This result is perhaps unsurprising since the trimer graph does not provide any additional chemical information compared to the dimer graph representation. Based on this finding, we anticipate that using even larger graph representations (i.e. tetramer or pentamer) will not improve model performance, but will unnecessarily require more computational resources for model training. Finally, comparing the performance of the dimer graph and the monomer graph representations illustrates that including more than one repeat unit in the graph significantly improves performance. It may seem counter-intuitive that the trimer graph and dimer graph representations perform similarly, whereas dimer graph representations considerably outperform monomer graph representations. However, this result can be explained by noting that the dimer graph representation contains additional chemical bonding information, relative to the monomer graph, since it directly represents the atoms that are bonded together to form the polymer chain. On the other hand, the trimer/dimer graph representations do not differ in the chemical information that they contain, but are simply scaled versions of each other.\n",

      "We note from the ablation experiments illustrated in Figure 3 that the largest reduction in error relative to the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline is due to using graph-based representations with the MPNN model. Using graph-based models results in at least a 13% average reduction in error, relative to the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline, whereas further refinements to the graph representation only affects the average performance by approximately 3-5%. To better understand why using graph-based representations in combination with a MPNN architecture leads to such a significant performance improvement, we analyze the learned feature vectors that are generated from the MPNN model. The MPNN model utilized in this work uses learned bond and atom features that are aggregated into a single fixed-length vector. This aggregated vector is then passed through a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers to generate the final property prediction. As a result, the vector in the final hidden layer of this feed-forward neural network can be considered as a learned encoding of the polymer that has been optimized by the MPNN model to make accurate property predictions. These vector encodings can therefore be analyzed to determine what chemical information the MPNN model is using to generate its predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline used previously (Table 1) utilizes pre-determined molecular descriptors (such as molecular weight), the vector encodings extracted from our MPNN model are vector representations that have been specifically optimized for the particular property that they are trained on. Comparing the performance of the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline and a RF model trained with these learned encodings therefore allows us to quantitatively understand if the superior performance of the graph-based models are due to these optimized encodings or the MPNN model architecture. To perform this experiment, we train the MPNN model on k-1 folds (k=5) of the Tg dataset. This trained MPNN model is then used to generate vector encodings for the polymers in the same k-1 folds of the dataset. Then, these vector encodings are used as inputs to train the RF model on the same k-1 folds of the dataset that the MPNN model was trained on. Finally, the test performance of the RF model is calculated for the remaining fold of the dataset that was not seen by the MPNN model nor the RF model in training. This procedure is repeated for k iterations to ensure that each fold of the dataset is used as the test set once and the reported performance is averaged across these k iterations. This training procedure prevents data leakage by ensuring that the test set is not seen by the MPNN model or the RF model before determining test performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of this experiment are given in Figure 4a). Remarkably, we find that the RF model with learned descriptors performs comparably to the MPNN/Polymer Graph model at predicting Tg. This result suggests that the excellent performance of the MPNN/Polymer Graph model is not due to MPNNs being a more powerful model architecture. Rather, the learned descriptors that the MPNN model extracts provides a more meaningful representation of polymers, leading to superior predictive capability. This finding is exciting because it suggests that the use of learned polymer representations that better capture the underlying chemical properties of polymers can lead to greatly improved predictive capabilities, even with relatively simple model architectures like random forests. It is important to note that the predetermined molecular descriptors that have been previously used for polymer prediction tasks were first developed as general descriptors for molecules, but with no guarantee that these descriptors will contain properties that are relevant for describing polymer properties.21 On the other hand, these learned MPNN descriptors are specifically trained to capture the relevant components of a polymer's structure that give rise to its properties. In this way, the MPNN model explored in this work provides a recipe for automatically extracting meaningful polymer representations directly from polymer property datasets in a manner that does not require any hand-crafted featurization.\n",

      "layer of the MPNN/Polymer Graph model and the predetermined molecular descriptors for the polymers in the Tg dataset. The 5 molecular descriptors that are most correlated with the MPNN learned features for the MPNN/Polymer Graph model are depicted in Figure 4b). Two of the most important known structural features for predicting Tg in polymers is: i) the presence of polar functional groups such as NH2 and OH that increase intermolecular forces, resulting in a higher Tg value and ii) the stiffness of the polymer chain, which is typically described in terms of the presence of rigid ring structures in the polymer backbone.27 The molecular descriptors shown in Figure 4b) are colored according to which one of these two known structural factors they explicitly capture. Interestingly, we see that the majority of the learned MPNN features are strongly correlated with these known relevant chemical features, which suggests that our MPNN model is autonomously learning the chemical features that are responsible for Tg directly from the dataset of Tg values. In particular, the most heavily weighted MPNN feature is correlated with the presence of polar groups, whereas the other top 5 features provide complex descriptions of the presence of ring structures in the polymer. However, we emphasize that these MPNN polymer encodings also contain new information that is not captured by the predetermined descriptors, as is shown by the superior performance of the RF model when using learned descriptors instead of predetermined descriptors (Figure 4a).\n",

      "Generally, this work has demonstrated how the development of representations that better account for the unique and complex chemical structure of polymers can be a powerful strategy for increasing the accuracy of polymer property predictions. Through a number of illustrative examples, we have demonstrated how a failure to account for periodicity in polymers can lead to property predictions that are inaccurate and unreliable. We have shown that these issues can be mitigated by our novel polymer graph representation that explicitly accounts for the inherent periodicity of polymeric materials. The results presented here therefore demonstrate that utilizing chemical intuition to construct physically-informed polymer representations is a viable strategy for advancing the predictive capabilities of ML models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The polymer informatics community has benefited greatly from the adaptation of machine learning algorithms and representations that were first developed for molecules. This approach is based on the assumption that general molecular descriptors are likely to work well across a broad spectrum of chemical classes, including polymers. In this work, we test this assumption by exploring the improvement in property predictions that can be achieved through the use of learned descriptors that are specifically optimized to capture the unique structural characteristics of polymers. We have shown that utilizing polymer-specific descriptors results in considerable improvements in the accuracy of polymer property predictions, compared to standard molecular descriptors. These results suggest that the structural characteristics that give rise to polymer properties are distinct from general molecular descriptors. This is perhaps unsurprising since it is well known that polymers are affected by structural elements that do not have molecular analogues, such as the branching structure of the polymer or its interchain interactions. We anticipate that the continued development of representations that are customized to capture the unique and complex structure of polymeric systems is therefore a fruitful direction for further pushing the limits of predicting polymer properties with ML.\n",

This network architecture operates on input molecular graphs to first generate a vector encoding of the graph, followed by a feed-forward neural network that converts the graph encodings into property predictions. The size of the bond message vectors is set to 300 and a total of 3 message-passing steps are used. The feed-forward neural network consists of 2 hidden layers, each consisting of 300 hidden neurons. All hyperparameters used are the Chemprop default values. We point interested readers to the Chemprop documentation for an extensive list of all hyperparameters used in this architecture.13 Unless otherwise stated, all models are trained with 5-fold cross-validation (CV) for 50 epochs on each fold. The best-performing model is chosen by selecting the model with the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) performance on the validation set.

      "To illustrate the inconsistencies that arise when using preexisting molecular descriptors to represent polymers, Figure S1 provides a visualize of the molecular descriptors generated from RDKit for 4 representative SMILES strings. According to the syntax of the SMILES strings, the '*' character is used to indicate the connection between repeating units of a polymer. The SMILES notation also does not explicitly indicate hydrogen atoms, but instead assumes that all atoms have the number of hydrogen atoms required for full valency. The '*CCO*' SMILES string therefore represents a (-CH2-CH2-O-)n polymer and the '*COC*' SMILES string represents the same polymer, (-CH2-O-CH2-)n, that has been trivially translated along the polymer backbone. Even though '*CCO*' and '*COC*' represent the same polymer, Figure S1 illustrates the different feature vectors that are generated from these SMILES strings. An understanding of why this difference arises can be obtained by looking at the molecular fragment features that are generated for these two SMILES string. The only difference in the molecular fragment features is the 'fr_ether' feature, which is a binary feature that indicates the presence of an ether functional group. As shown in Figure S1, the '*CCO*' has fr_ether=0 (indicating the absence of an ether), whereas '*COC*' has fr_ether=1 (indicating the presence of an ether). Evidently, the inconsistent featurization between these two chemically identical SMILES strings is due to a lack of periodicity. Since the '*CCO*' SMILES string does not treat the terminal oxygen atom as being bonded to two neighboring carbon atoms, using the '*CCO*' SMILES string results in an incorrect featurization of fr_ether=0, when this polymer does in fact contain an ether.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of including the '*' character in the SMILES representation is illustrated with feature vectors of the 'CCO' and 'COC' SMILES strings, which are the monomer subunits of '*CCO*' and '*COC*', respectively. Interestingly, all four of these inputs yield four different feature vectors. Although these inconsistencies could be accounted for by designating a standardized SMILES string to use as an input for a given polymer, it is unlikely that such a standardized system would always capture the correct periodicity of the polymer. Instead, the use of the polymer graph representation as described in the main text ensures that the periodicity of the polymer is maintained and always generates a consistent representation.\n",

      "1. **Title of the Plot**: The title \"Graph Neural Networks in Polymer Processing\" is not explicitly stated in the provided paper. However, it is a valid and relevant title for the plot created.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **X-axis and Y-axis Labels**: The labels \"Input Graph Representation\" for the X-axis and \"Output Prediction\" for the Y-axis fit the context of how GNNs process graph representations of polymers to produce predictions, though they are not directly mentioned in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Node and Edge Labels**: The specific labeling of nodes as 'C', 'H', 'O', and 'N' (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen) aligns with common types of atoms found in polymer structures but is not specified in the paper. This is a reasonable assumption for a simplified representation but should be clearly stated as such.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adjustments for Accuracy:\n",
      "- Ensure that the elements such as labels and titles are contextually in line with general concepts from the paper, even if they are not explicitly mentioned.\n",
      "- Consider adding annotations or a legend to clarify the specific assumption about the types of nodes (atoms) being used in the plot if they are not derived directly from the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Final Plot:\n",
      "1. **Add Legend/Annotations**: Include a legend or annotations to clarify that 'C', 'H', 'O', and 'N' are representing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen respectively, as a simplified schematic.\n",
      "2. **Title Confirmation**: While the title is relevant, ensure that it encompasses the broader context of the research paper.\n",
      "3. **Explain Assumptions**: Clearly state any assumptions made for the schematic representation to align with research insights.\n",

      "In scientific research, accurately aligning computational predictions with experimental data is crucial for affirming theoretical models. Atomistic calculations, a popular computational approach, have been instrumental in predicting and elucidating phenomena at the molecular level within polymer science. This section explores how experimental data can validate and support these computational predictions, detailing types of experimental data, methods bridging computational and experimental approaches, and real-world case studies.\n",

      "#### Types of Experimental Data\n",
      "\n",
      "Experimental data critical to validating atomistic calculations in polymer science include thermomechanical properties, spectroscopic measures, and morphological characteristics. Thermomechanical properties, such as glass transition temperature (Tg) and mechanical strength, can be compared against predictions to assess a model's reliability. Techniques like Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermomechanical Analysis (TMA) provide precise measurements of Tg and mechanical responses, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spectroscopic analyses, including Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), offer insights into the molecular structure and environment of polymers. These analyses are particularly useful for verifying the results of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations that predict the structural organization and dynamic behaviors of polymer chains.\n",
      "\n",

The iterative approach starts with computational predictions that guide experimental setups, subsequently feeding the experimental results back into models to refine and enhance their predictive power. This continuous feedback loop ensures models are dynamically optimized for better accuracy.\n",

      "**Integrated Workflow Framework**: A structured workflow merges the two domains. Initially, atomistic calculations predict properties of hypothetical polymer structures. These predictions guide the synthesis of the polymers, followed by experimental validation through above-mentioned techniques. The deviations encountered during experiments are analyzed to fine-tune the computational models (Zheng et al., 2024).\n",

      "**Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporating machine learning into this process provides a powerful tool to handle the vast and complex data from experiments and simulations. Algorithms like the Message-Passing Neural Network (MPNN) are utilized to predict polymer properties based on their graph representations, capturing periodicity and other inherent structures. Experimental data are then used to train and validate these models, significantly enhancing their accuracy (Antoniuk et al., 2022).\n",

Researchers utilized MD simulations to predict the properties of vitrimers with specific Tg. Bayesian optimization was used to propose novel vitrimers with target Tg, followed by synthesis and experimental characterization. The consistency between the predicted and actual Tg validated the computational model's accuracy (Zheng et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Case Study 2: PolymerModeler Validation**: The PolymerModeler tool demonstrates another instance of successful integration of computational and experimental approaches. By conducting MD simulations using the Dreiding force field, researchers predicted properties such as the glass transition temperature of polymers. Experimental validation through various methods, including DSC and SEM, confirmed the accuracy of these predictions, thereby establishing the reliability of PolymerModeler for simulating amorphous polymers (Haley et al., 2015).\n",

      "One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials. Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, as well as how to automatically develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Specifically, our pipeline for polymer property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations with a sizable 20% average reduction in prediction error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding periodicity into our polymer graph representation is responsible for a considerable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while achieving better predictive performance than human-derived features. Whereas previous polymer informatics have typically utilized hand-designed descriptors that have been optimized for representing molecules, this work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.\n",

      "The complex chemical structure of polymers provides chemists with an unprecedented level of chemical design opportunities. As a result, efforts focused on the rational design of polymers has led to their use in a remarkably wide range of applications.1,2 By varying a polymer's monomer structure, its propagation site, or the polymer chain length, the properties of the polymer can be tuned to suit the application of interest.3 6 Formulations of polymers with chemical additives adds an even richer potential design and functional space. However, efficiently navigating this vast chemical design space to identify promising polymer materials for a given application is incredibly challenging. Recently, the field of polymer informatics has shown much promise in tackling this challenge by utilizing machine learning (ML) models to learn the complex structure-property relationships of polymers.7,8 Through the development of increasingly accurate ML models, one can envision the future possibility of fully computational polymer design workflows whereby polymers can be rapidly designed in silico to satisfy multiple property criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate machine learning models require that the input to the model - be it an image, text, or chemical structure - is transformed into a machine-readable format that captures and represents all relevant features of the input. The development of suitable polymer representations to use as inputs for machine learning algorithms has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in the field of polymer informatics.9,10 Unlike molecules that consist of a fixed number of atoms and typically only contain dozens of atoms, a given polymer can consist of a periodic chain of between 100-106 repeating chemical sub-units.11\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents a considerable challenge for creating machine-readable polymer representations since they must encode the periodic nature of the polymer structure and also be compact enough to represent up to millions of atoms. Despite these challenges, previous work on small molecules and crystalline solids has demonstrated that developing physically-inspired representations of atomistic systems is a fruitful direction towards realizing significant improvements in property prediction accuracy.12-15\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we develop a new polymer representation that is the first to explicitly capture the periodic nature of polymeric materials. First, we show that the widely used monomer-based representations cannot sufficiently describe the periodic, extended structure of polymers and can result in unreliable property predictions. To solve this issue, we have developed a novel polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph and that naturally incorporates polymers' periodicity in its construction. Across a diverse spectrum of 10 unique polymer properties, we find that our polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous monomer-based representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction error. Finally, we demonstrate how our polymer graph representations can be combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework to automatically extract chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from a dataset of polymer properties. We find that these MPNN-learned polymer features yield more accurate property predictions than predetermined features that have been hand-crafted by chemists over years.\n",

      "Recently, a wide range of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately predict polymer properties in an a priori manner.16,17 These previous approaches typically represent polymers by their monomer repeat unit which is then converted into either i) molecular descriptors that includes the presence of molecular fragments and/or property descriptors (such as the molecular weight of the molecule)18-20 or ii) a molecular graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds are represented as edges (Figure 1a)).17 It should be noted that these representations were first developed for molecules before being transferred to the field of polymer informatics. Although these monomer-based representations perform well at representing finite molecules, we show in this work that monomer-based representations cannot adequately represent the extended chain structures that define polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using monomer-based representations as inputs for ML algorithms results in at least three notable issues: i) the generation of non-unique representations for polymers that are composed of the similar monomer repeat units (see \"monomer graphs\" of Polymer A and B in Figure 1 c), ii) incorrect bonding environment of the polymer, and iii) a lack of periodicity. Polymers A and B in Figure 1c) are two distinct polymers with notably different chemical structures and properties. Since the monomer of a polymer is defined as the smallest repeat unit of the polymer chain, the monomer of the two polymers in Figure 1 c) is therefore the same C-C-O subunit (or CH3 CH2OH if including hydrogen atoms). Regardless of the specific details of the featurization used, generating a representation of Polymer A and B based only on their monomers will result in two identical representations (see Supplementary Note 1). In turn, an ML algorithm that then uses these representations to learn a structure-property relationship will, at best, only be able to learn the average value of the property across the polymers, which may lead to large prediction errors. The second issue that will arise from the use of monomer-based representations is the incorrect featurization of the polymer. Polymer B consists of a repeating (-C-C-O-) backbone, which is characterized by an ether functional group (R-O-R, where R is any alkane). However, the monomer of Polymer B ( C-C-O) does not contain an ether functional group since this ether group is artificially fragmented when forming the monomer representation. This is particularly problematic since both fingerprinting approaches and property descriptors utilize the presence of functional groups and connectivity in their representations (Supplementary Note 1).21-23 Thirdly, the failure to include periodicity in these monomer-based representations results in representations that are inconsistent due to trivial translations along the polymer backbone. The polymer (-C-C-O-)n can also be written as (-C-O-C-)n by translating all atoms one position along the polymer chain. However, the monomer representations for these two equivalent polymer representations would be C-C-O and C-O-C, respectively. As shown in this example, the failure to explicitly account for periodicity in these monomer-based representations can result in inconsistent featurizations, which can negatively impact the ability of ML algorithms to learn the underlying structure-property relationships. These inconsistent featurizations are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamentally, all three of the aforementioned problems arise due to a failure to account for the periodic nature of polymers. In other words, a finite molecule (i.e. a monomer) cannot be used to represent a continuous, extended chain of atoms without fragmenting chemical bonds in an unphysical manner. We note that featurizing Polymers A and B by generating dimers (or any larger oligomer chain) instead of monomers results in unique representations. Using a dimer representation, however, still results in incorrect featurizations due to the incomplete bonding environment of the atoms at the terminal end of the dimer.\n",

      "In this work, we introduce a new polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph that solves all three of these problems. The core idea of the polymer graph is that adding a bond between the two terminal ends of the polymer chain creates a periodic polymer representation (Figure 1b)). The periodic nature of this representation eliminates the need for artificially cleaving chemical bonds, ensuring that the correct bonding environment is maintained for all atoms in the polymer. We note that this approach is strongly reminiscent of the crystal graph representations that has had wide success in representing periodic crystalline materials that extend indefinitely in all three dimensions.12 Crystal graph representations have solved the problem of representing an infinite 3-D crystal by treating it as the smallest repeat unit (referred to as the unit cell) that then transmits chemical information by interacting with periodic copies of itself in all directions. In an analogous fashion, the polymer graph developed in this work is formed from the repeat unit of the polymer that is able to transmit chemical information through the added periodic bond. We emphasize that this periodic bond is used only for representing the polymer, but should not be interpreted to mean that the polymers are always part of a chemical ring system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph-based representations of molecules and crystalline solids have recently been the subject of considerable research efforts and are currently the state-of-the-art representation for predicting the properties of these systems. 13,24,25 Generally these graphs represent each atom in the chemical system, i, by an atom embedding vector (hi) which is updated through messages that are sent through the edges of the graph. These update messages typically operate on all atoms and bonds in the local neighbor- hood of atom i, where the local neighborhood is given by the edges of the graph that are connected to atom i. To generate our polymer graph representation, we first create a standard trimer graph and then add an additional edge to connect the two terminal atoms of the trimer (Figure 1 b)). This added edge in our polymer graph representation not only maintains the correct bonding environment for all atoms, but also serves to ensure that messages (i.e. chemical information) can be sent throughout the polymer graph. For example, the left-most carbon atom in the monomer graph in Figure 1a) will only directly receive messages from the central carbon atom since this is the only atom that it is bonded to. This is not an accurate representation of the true chemical structure of this polymer since this carbon atom is directly bonded to both a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. On the other hand, since our polymer graph representation creates an edge between the terminal carbon and oxygen atoms, messages are directly passed between both of these two atoms, thus allowing the atom embedding vector of the terminal carbon atom to more accurately represent its true chemical environment. We construct the polymer graph from a trimer graph (rather than a dimer or monomer graph) to ensure that the added periodic bond is between atoms that are distinct and not already bonded to each other.\n",

      "To demonstrate the accuracy and generality of our polymer graph representation for predicting polymer properties, we collect a dataset of polymer properties containing 15,219 datapoints across 10 distinct properties (see Methods for dataset details). Notably, this dataset includes a diverse set of property types (thermal, structural, optical, electronic) as well as data collected from both experimental and computational sources, which allows us to assess the capability of our approach to learn meaningful polymer representations for general property prediction tasks. To perform a baseline comparison, we also train ML models on all 10 properties with two commonly used monomer-based representations: i) molecular descriptors and ii) molecular graphs of the monomer (Table 1). All graph-based models are trained with a MPNN model, whereas a random forest (RF) model is used for training with the monomer descriptors (see Methods for model architecture and hyperparameter details).\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing the performance of the RF/Molecular Descriptors and the MPNN/Monomer Graph in Table 1 illustrates the increase in performance that is realized when using graph-based models for polymer property prediction. Across 8 out of 10 properties, the MPNN/Monomer graph model outperforms the RF/Molecular Descriptors model. On average, the MPNN/Monomer Graph model achieves 12 % lower error than the RF/Molecular Descriptors model, with remarkably large reductions in error for predicting atomization energy (43%), band gap bulk (17%), and electron affinity (32%). Both models perform similarly at predicting ionization energy, whereas the RF/Molecular Descriptors model performs slightly better only at predicting the crystallization tendency. The poor performance of the monomer graph model for predicting crystallization tendency may be due to the fact that these values were calculated with the use of an approximate group contribution method.26 The low fidelity of this dataset may therefore be preventing the graph model from learning reasonable atom/bond features for predicting crystallization tendency. Based on the results across all properties, we conclude that graph-based models can generally be expected to perform, at worst, comparably to RF/Molecular Descriptor models, with the potential to perform significantly better on certain properties. This finding is in agreement with a previous report which showed that monomer graph-based models outperform ECFP molecular descriptors for predicting the glass transition temperature, melting temperature, density, and elastic modulus for a subclass of polymers known as polyamides.17 In the present work, we expand this finding to show that graph-based models can generally be expected to outperform models based on molecular descriptors across a broader range of polymer properties and for datasets that contain all subclasses of polymers.\n",

      "Now that we have demonstrated the ability of graph-based models to perform well at predicting polymer properties, we now explore how the construction of the graph itself can influence model performance. Table 1 illustrates the performance of monomer graph and polymer graph representations with the same MPNN model. Although we have already demonstrated that the MPNN/Monomer Graph model considerably outperforms the current state-of-the-art RF/Molecular Descriptor models, we find that using our polymer graph representation results in a further 10% average reduction in error compared to the monomer graph model and does not perform significantly worse than the monomer graph model for any of the properties. The polymer graph representation results in a significant reduction in error for predicting atomization error (33%), band gap chain (15%), ionization energy (19%) and glass transition temperature (10%), compared to the monomer graph representation. Since the improvement in property prediction accuracy achieved by the polymer graph is highly property-dependant, we note that the 10% average reduction in error reported here is likely to vary depending on the chosen set of properties of interest. Nevertheless, we do not find any properties where the polymer graph performs significantly worse than the monomer graph representation, leading us to conclude that the polymer graph should be expected to yield more accurate property predictions across a wide range of properties.\n",

      "Our original hypothesis to motivate the development of our polymer graph representation was that it can improve over monomer graph representations by being able to distinguish between polymers that have the same monomer representation. To test this idea, we construct a test set of 179 glass transition temperature (Tg) datapoints where each polymer in the dataset has at least one other polymer that contains the same monomer representation, as depicted by polymers A-C in Figure 2. We train a MPNN/Monomer Graph model and a MPNN/Polymer Graph model on a Tg training set that does not include these 179 polymers and then evaluate their ability to predict the Tg of the 179 polymers in the test set. This experiment therefore allows us to quantify the impact on prediction accuracy that results from the inability of monomer graphs to distinguish between polymers that have the same monomer representation.\n",

      "As illustrated in Figure 2, the inability of the MPNN/Monomer graph model to distinguish between polymers A-C results in the same Tg prediction for all three polymers. Since the experimental Tg value varies largely between these three polymers, this results in an unacceptably large prediction error of over 60℃. Although polymers A-C are chosen as an illustrative example, a more statistically significant comparison can be obtained from the performance on the entire test set of 179 polymers. Consistent with our original hypothesis, we see that the inability of the monomer graph representation to distinguish between the polymers in this test set results in significantly worse performance when compared to Table 1 (49°C vs. 39℃). On the other hand, the polymer graph representation is not only able to distinguish between these polymers, but also quantitatively capture the trends in Tg values for polymers A-C with a RMSE that is nearly 60% less than that of the monomer graph. These results therefore\n",

By being able to distinguish between polymers of the same monomer structure, the polymer graph representation is therefore better able to learn quantitative structure-property relationships for the properties in Table 1. Since the proportion of polymers that have the same monomer structure is relatively small ( 2% of the Tg dataset), we anticipate that this effect is currently small, but will grow in importance as more polymers are discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of the experiment shown in Figure 2 also have important practical implications for the reliability that can be expected when using ML methods to discover new polymers. The Tg of a polymer is the temperature at which the thermal motions of the polymers are large enough to overcome the forces that hold the amorphous polymer together, such that the polymer is able to undergo large-scale molecular motions.27 Accurately predicting the glass transition temperature is therefore of great importance since Tg is often treated as the maximum temperature that the polymer can be used.28 Despite having identical chemical compositions, the three polymers shown in Figure 2 exhibit a remarkably broad range of experimental Tg values due to their unique chemical structures. In particular, the presence of the hydroxyl (OH) group on Polymer A leads to an increase in interchain attractive forces, resulting in a significantly larger Tg value than for Polymers B and C.29 The inability of monomer-based graph representations to distinguish between these polymers therefore severely hurts the trustworthiness of the model. If one were to use the MPNN/Monomer Graph model to discover new polymers, the large errors in this subset of Tg predictions could manifest in the discovery of polymers that are thermodynamically unstable at the desired operating temperature. By comparison, the consistent performance seen by the MPNN/Polymer Graph model helps to instill confidence that the predictions will be robust across a large dataset of polymer materials.\n",

      "Although the results in Table 1 and Figure 2 suggest that the polymer graph representation can more accurately predict polymer properties than both the monomer graph and molecular descriptor representations, they do not fully explain what is causing this improvement in performance. Understanding specifically how polymer representation can impact predictive performance is important for the development of increasingly better polymer representations. To accomplish this goal, we perform several ablation experiments whereby we systematically alter components of the polymer graph representation to allow us to quantify the contribution of each component to overall model performance (Figure 3). We conduct this experiment by training the same MPNN model as before on the same 10 properties listed in Table 1. For clarity, we illustrate the performance of each representation by calculating the average performance across all properties (Figure 3).

This result is perhaps unsurprising since the trimer graph does not provide any additional chemical information compared to the dimer graph representation. Based on this finding, we anticipate that using even larger graph representations (i.e. tetramer or pentamer) will not improve model performance, but will unnecessarily require more computational resources for model training. Finally, comparing the performance of the dimer graph and the monomer graph representations illustrates that including more than one repeat unit in the graph significantly improves performance. It may seem counter-intuitive that the trimer graph and dimer graph representations perform similarly, whereas dimer graph representations considerably outperform monomer graph representations. However, this result can be explained by noting that the dimer graph representation contains additional chemical bonding information, relative to the monomer graph, since it directly represents the atoms that are bonded together to form the polymer chain. On the other hand, the trimer/dimer graph representations do not differ in the chemical information that they contain, but are simply scaled versions of each other.\n",

      "We note from the ablation experiments illustrated in Figure 3 that the largest reduction in error relative to the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline is due to using graph-based representations with the MPNN model. Using graph-based models results in at least a 13% average reduction in error, relative to the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline, whereas further refinements to the graph representation only affects the average performance by approximately 3-5%. To better understand why using graph-based representations in combination with a MPNN architecture leads to such a significant performance improvement, we analyze the learned feature vectors that are generated from the MPNN model. The MPNN model utilized in this work uses learned bond and atom features that are aggregated into a single fixed-length vector. This aggregated vector is then passed through a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers to generate the final property prediction. As a result, the vector in the final hidden layer of this feed-forward neural network can be considered as a learned encoding of the polymer that has been optimized by the MPNN model to make accurate property predictions. These vector encodings can therefore be analyzed to determine what chemical information the MPNN model is using to generate its predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline used previously (Table 1) utilizes pre-determined molecular descriptors (such as molecular weight), the vector encodings extracted from our MPNN model are vector representations that have been specifically optimized for the particular property that they are trained on. Comparing the performance of the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline and a RF model trained with these learned encodings therefore allows us to quantitatively understand if the superior performance of the graph-based models are due to these optimized encodings or the MPNN model architecture. To perform this experiment, we train the MPNN model on k-1 folds (k=5) of the Tg dataset. This trained MPNN model is then used to generate vector encodings for the polymers in the same k-1 folds of the dataset. Then, these vector encodings are used as inputs to train the RF model on the same k-1 folds of the dataset that the MPNN model was trained on. Finally, the test performance of the RF model is calculated for the remaining fold of the dataset that was not seen by the MPNN model nor the RF model in training. This procedure is repeated for k iterations to ensure that each fold of the dataset is used as the test set once and the reported performance is averaged across these k iterations. This training procedure prevents data leakage by ensuring that the test set is not seen by the MPNN model or the RF model before determining test performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of this experiment are given in Figure 4a). Remarkably, we find that the RF model with learned descriptors performs comparably to the MPNN/Polymer Graph model at predicting Tg. This result suggests that the excellent performance of the MPNN/Polymer Graph model is not due to MPNNs being a more powerful model architecture. Rather, the learned descriptors that the MPNN model extracts provides a more meaningful representation of polymers, leading to superior predictive capability. This finding is exciting because it suggests that the use of learned polymer representations that better capture the underlying chemical properties of polymers can lead to greatly improved predictive capabilities, even with relatively simple model architectures like random forests. It is important to note that the predetermined molecular descriptors that have been previously used for polymer prediction tasks were first developed as general descriptors for molecules, but with no guarantee that these descriptors will contain properties that are relevant for describing polymer properties.21 On the other hand, these learned MPNN descriptors are specifically trained to capture the relevant components of a polymer's structure that give rise to its properties. In this way, the MPNN model explored in this work provides a recipe for automatically extracting meaningful polymer representations directly from polymer property datasets in a manner that does not require any hand-crafted featurization.\n",

The 5 molecular descriptors that are most correlated with the MPNN learned features for the MPNN/Polymer Graph model are depicted in Figure 4b). Two of the most important known structural features for predicting Tg in polymers is: i) the presence of polar functional groups such as NH2 and OH that increase intermolecular forces, resulting in a higher Tg value and ii) the stiffness of the polymer chain, which is typically described in terms of the presence of rigid ring structures in the polymer backbone.27 The molecular descriptors shown in Figure 4b) are colored according to which one of these two known structural factors they explicitly capture. Interestingly, we see that the majority of the learned MPNN features are strongly correlated with these known relevant chemical features, which suggests that our MPNN model is autonomously learning the chemical features that are responsible for Tg directly from the dataset of Tg values. In particular, the most heavily weighted MPNN feature is correlated with the presence of polar groups, whereas the other top 5 features provide complex descriptions of the presence of ring structures in the polymer. However, we emphasize that these MPNN polymer encodings also contain new information that is not captured by the predetermined descriptors, as is shown by the superior performance of the RF model when using learned descriptors instead of predetermined descriptors (Figure 4a).\n",

Through a number of illustrative examples, we have demonstrated how a failure to account for periodicity in polymers can lead to property predictions that are inaccurate and unreliable. We have shown that these issues can be mitigated by our novel polymer graph representation that explicitly accounts for the inherent periodicity of polymeric materials. The results presented here therefore demonstrate that utilizing chemical intuition to construct physically-informed polymer representations is a viable strategy for advancing the predictive capabilities of ML models.\n",

      "The polymer informatics community has benefited greatly from the adaptation of machine learning algorithms and representations that were first developed for molecules. This approach is based on the assumption that general molecular descriptors are likely to work well across a broad spectrum of chemical classes, including polymers. In this work, we test this assumption by exploring the improvement in property predictions that can be achieved through the use of learned descriptors that are specifically optimized to capture the unique structural characteristics of polymers. We have shown that utilizing polymer-specific descriptors results in considerable improvements in the accuracy of polymer property predictions, compared to standard molecular descriptors. These results suggest that the structural characteristics that give rise to polymer properties are distinct from general molecular descriptors. This is perhaps unsurprising since it is well known that polymers are affected by structural elements that do not have molecular analogues, such as the branching structure of the polymer or its interchain interactions. We anticipate that the continued development of representations that are customized to capture the unique and complex structure of polymeric systems is therefore a fruitful direction for further pushing the limits of predicting polymer properties with ML.\n",

      "To illustrate the inconsistencies that arise when using preexisting molecular descriptors to represent polymers, Figure S1 provides a visualize of the molecular descriptors generated from RDKit for 4 representative SMILES strings. According to the syntax of the SMILES strings, the '*' character is used to indicate the connection between repeating units of a polymer. The SMILES notation also does not explicitly indicate hydrogen atoms, but instead assumes that all atoms have the number of hydrogen atoms required for full valency. The '*CCO*' SMILES string therefore represents a (-CH2-CH2-O-)n polymer and the '*COC*' SMILES string represents the same polymer, (-CH2-O-CH2-)n, that has been trivially translated along the polymer backbone. Even though '*CCO*' and '*COC*' represent the same polymer, Figure S1 illustrates the different feature vectors that are generated from these SMILES strings. An understanding of why this difference arises can be obtained by looking at the molecular fragment features that are generated for these two SMILES string. The only difference in the molecular fragment features is the 'fr_ether' feature, which is a binary feature that indicates the presence of an ether functional group. As shown in Figure S1, the '*CCO*' has fr_ether=0 (indicating the absence of an ether), whereas '*COC*' has fr_ether=1 (indicating the presence of an ether). Evidently, the inconsistent featurization between these two chemically identical SMILES strings is due to a lack of periodicity. Since the '*CCO*' SMILES string does not treat the terminal oxygen atom as being bonded to two neighboring carbon atoms, using the '*CCO*' SMILES string results in an incorrect featurization of fr_ether=0, when this polymer does in fact contain an ether.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of including the '*' character in the SMILES representation is illustrated with feature vectors of the 'CCO' and 'COC' SMILES strings, which are the monomer subunits of '*CCO*' and '*COC*', respectively. Interestingly, all four of these inputs yield four different feature vectors. Although these inconsistencies could be accounted for by designating a standardized SMILES string to use as an input for a given polymer, it is unlikely that such a standardized system would always capture the correct periodicity of the polymer. Instead, the use of the polymer graph representation as described in the main text ensures that the periodicity of the polymer is maintained and always generates a consistent representation.\n",

      "Atomistic simulations are a powerful tool to predict materials properties and un- cover the fundamental mechanisms that govern them from first principles; these techniques are expected to play an increasingly important role in the design of new materials with tailored properties. [1, 2] Among many other contributions, molec- ular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided invaluable insight into the re- sponse of materials under extreme conditions[3, 4], size effects on plastic deform- ation[5], and polymer dynamics [6]. MD simulations are ubiquitous in science and engineering due, in part, to the continuing increase in computing power and the availability of efficient, parallel, and scalable codes that can make effective use of current supercomputers [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\n",

      "\n",
      "GROMACS[13], and AMBER[14] are designed to simulate soft matter systems, the simulation of amorphous polymers remains challenging due to the difficulties involved in generating accurate molecular structures to be used as initial condi- tions in MD simulations. Unlike crystalline materials where initial atomic posi- tions can be easily generated by replicating a unit cell, or in atomic amorphous solids where equilibrated structures can be obtained from the melt [15, 16], the generation of amorphous thermoset or thermoplastic polymer structures requires special-purpose algorithms [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Chain dynamics in linear- chain polymers involve timescales well beyond those achievable with MD simu- lations, especially for large molecular-weight cases[24], and if the initial structure does not exhibit correct statistical properties the simulations will produce inaccu- rate results.\n",

      "Some commercial software packages, such as MAPS by Scienomics and Ma- terials Studio by Accelrys, Inc, offer the capability to build atomistic structures of condensed-phase amorphous polymers using a simple GUI, pack the chains into a simulation volume, and perform MD simulations.

These codes requires users to create input files in domain-specific mini-languages, in addition to compiling and running the program in order to pack chains in preparation for MD simula- tions. The ECCE[28] tool offers a GUI for building systems that may be simu- lated using ab initio packages such as Gaussian[29] but not with general purpose MD codes. Thus, we designed and developed PolymerModeler to provide a easy- to-use, general-purpose, freely accessible tool to build amorphous thermoplastic structures and perform MD simulations. We expect the tool to be useful both for education and in research: setting simulations up is simple enough to be used in the classroom, all that is required is an internet connection, yet, the code is pow- erful enough for research and can also be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art techniques to relax polymer structures and predict their properties.\n",

The only requirement is a nanoHUB account that can be obtained after a free reg- istration. nanoHUB [30] makes simulation tools accessible through a standard web browser or an iPad app, removing the need for users to download, configure, and install software and learn scripts or domain-specific languages. The state of a simulation is preserved even after closing the browser in which it is running or logging out of nanoHUB so that the user can return to the simulation later. Users can provide feedback and ask questions in nanoHUB.org.

      "The process of building a condensed-phase, amorphous, linear-chain polymer in PolymerModeler can be divided in three main steps: i) the specification of one or multiple monomers and their statistical arrangement into chains, including the chain length and number of chains to pack in the simulation cell, ii) the deter-\n",

      "mination of the simulation cell into which the chains will be placed; and iii) the specification of rules for the sequential placement of monomers into chains of the desired length with conformation given by a set of dihedral angles between monomers. In PolymerModeler this last step is performed using the continuous configurational bias Monte Carlo algorithm [17]. The following subsections de- scribe these steps including details of the algorithms, approximations, and their implementation after which results of the builder are presented. Once the chains are built, PolymerModeler performs a series of relaxations to remove bad con- tacts and reduce entanglements after which molecular dynamics can be performed to predict thermo-mechanical properties; these relaxation and MD steps are de- scribed in Section 3.\n",

      "The first step in building amorphous thermoplastic polymers is specifying the re- peating unit which will be used to construct chains, and users can choose between a set of pre-built monomers or create/upload their own. The PolymerModeler tool accepts monomer specifications in the commonly used PDB (protein data bank) and XYZ file formats. Files of these types are available from a wide variety of online databases and may be uploaded directly to the PolymerModeler tool with no modification. The user must also specify which atom in the monomer is the head atom and which is the tail. The builder constructs a chain by adding one monomer unit at a time. Once a new monomer is added, the tail atom of the previous monomer on the chain is removed and so is the head atom of the new monomer. The final step is the creation of a bond between the backbone atoms originally attached to the head and tail atoms just removed. The head and tail atoms must each be connected to the molecule by a single bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Internally the PolymerModeler tool converts a PDB or XYZ monomer to a z-matrix (internal coordinates format) representation that details the bonds, bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion (dihedral) angles between atoms. In this repre- sentation, the head atom is listed first, followed by all the backbone atoms to the tail, then all other atoms in the monomer. The PolymerModeler tool also accepts monomer specifications in this z-matrix format. The box describes the z-matrix format and shows an example for a PMMA monomer.\n",

From the second atom on, the second column of the z-matrix indicates the index of a previously defined atom to which the current atom (the atom specified by the current line) is bonded; the third column is then the bond length, in Angstroms, between these two atoms. For the third atom on, an angle needs to be specified to fully determine its internal position, so two additional columns are needed indicating a third atom (column four) and the corresponding bond angle, in degrees, is in the fifth column. For the remaining atoms a dihedral angle needs to be specified; the sixth column gives the index to a fourth atom required to specify a dihedral angle (defined between the plane determined by atoms on columns 6, 4 and 2 with that determined by atoms on columns 1, 2 and 4). The torsion angle between these planes is given, in degrees, in the final column. Pre-built z-matrix representations of several monomers are available in PolymerModeler.\n",

A probability arrangement assigns relative weights to the defined monomers, which are stochastically added to a chain according to these weights. Multiple arrangements (patterns or probabilities) can be defined, with relative weights, to support the growth of multiple chain configurations in the same sys- tem. The builder chooses a pattern for each chain added to the system, according the the weights assigned to the patterns, and constructs the entire chain according to the selected pattern. In this manner the builder allows the full specification of stereochemistry.

      "The principal polymer builder algorithm supported by PolymerModeler is the con- tinuous configurational biased direct Monte Carlo[17] that efficiently samples tor- sions along the polymer backbone and leads to structures with reasonable statis- tical weights. Chain conformations are governed by covalent interactions associ- ated with torsional angles along the backbone and by non-bond interactions that cause chains to avoid overlaps and for affine groups to tend to coalesce. These interactions cause chains to extend in good solvents and coil in bad solvents. In addition to the continuous configurational biased direct Monte Carlo algorithm PolymerModeler allows to build freely rotating chain polymers, rod-like poly- mers and chains built using self-avoiding walks for educational and verification purposes.\n",

      "Due to their high stiffness, bond lengths and angles are fixed at their equilib- rium values throughout the building procedure bond distances; this is commonly done in polymer builders. Thus, dihedral angles between backbone atoms (pi) are the only degrees of freedom considered during the initial structure creation. The first monomer is placed into the simulation cell at a random location (with uniform probability density) and with random orientation (with uniform angular distribution). Monomers are added sequentially with their torsion angles chosen according to the Boltzmann weight, i.e. the probability density of torsion i taking the angle o¡ is proportional to exp [-E (pi) /kT] where E (pi) is the energy of the of the corresponding configuration, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature. The energy associated with the configuration is obtained by adding van der Waals interactions and the covalent torsional energy as described in the following sub-sections.\n",

      "The PolymerModeler builder uses a Metropolis[33] Monte Carlo algorithm to explore and select torsion angle configurations. Initial angles are assigned ran- domly for all flexible torsions in the new monomer and a Metropolis Monte Carlo Markov chain is performed to determine the actual torsion angle values according to their Boltzmann weight. The Monte Carlo steps are as follows:\n",

      "Covalent energy of backbone torsion angles The PolymerModeler amorphous builder allows users to specify the covalent torsional potential in two ways.

Alternatively, users can specify a probability as a function\n",

      "Non-bond interactions. Non-bond interactions in the continuous configura- tional biased direct Monte Carlo play a key role avoiding bad contacts between atoms. PolymerModeler computes the non-bond energy as the sum of Lennard- Jones pair interactions between each atom in the tail monomer and all surround- ing atoms, using Dreiding parameters. As is customary in molecular force fields, atoms in the same chain separated by fewer than four bonds are excluded from these non-bond interactions. The cutoff number of bonds for non-bond interac- tions is a configurable parameter.\n",

      "Computation of pair-wise interactions. A brute-force calculation of inter- atomic distance between the atoms of every new monomer with all previously built requires 1/2N(N -1) computations (N being the number of atoms) and becomes prohibitively expensive for relatively large systems. Thus, PolymerModeler uses the well-known domain decomposition approach to transform this computation into an O(N) calculation. The simulation cell volume is divided via a 3D grid with spacing AL, close to but larger than the cutoff distance for van der Waals interactions for the Monte Carlo algorithm. As new monomers are added into the system atoms are placed into their corresponding cell; this involves O(N) cal- culations. In order to compute inter-atomic distances to compute van der Waals energies or impose volume exclusions for an atom belonging to cell i only atoms in cell i and in its 26 nearest neighbors need to be checked. This calculations is independent of the simulation cell size for a given density and, thus, the algorithm is O(N).\n",

Scaled Dreiding Lennard-Jones parameters are used for this relax- ation. Each minimization scales both the energy and distance parameters. The use of scaled van der Waals interactions is motivated by the reduction in entangle- ments as chains can slide past one another as is done in state-of-the-art methods to relax amorphous polymers [19].

      "The molecular relaxation timescales of polymer melts (which increase with molec- ular weight as N3.4 for high molecular weight cases[45]) are prohibitively long for molecular dynamics simulations in most cases of interest. Thus the initial molecu- lar structure and its relaxation is critical for accurate MD simulations. [46, 44] The mean square displacement (MSD) between monomers as a function of their index in a polymer chain was found to be a useful descriptor of the polymer structure. Auhl et al. [44] showed that a simple relaxation of as-built polymer samples via energy minimization leads to unphysical molecular structure changes that relax over very long timescales and, consequently, affect predictions. These changes are reflected as significant deviations in the MSD for short and intermediate dis- tances. They found that a slow push-off approach, where intermolecular forces are turned on gradually, minimizes these problems and leads to well-equilibrated molecular structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "PolymerModeler allows multi-step relaxations where non-bond interactions are turned on gradually and we subjected our model to the same tests as in Ref. [44]. Figure 10 shows the mean square internal distances (MSD) between monomers for chains of polyethylene built using various algorithms, for comparison with Ref. [44]. As expected, building the chains using a naive, freely-rotating model without avoiding close contacts leads to the smallest mean square displacements; adding Lennard Jones interactions during build increases the MSD and using the configuration biased Monte Carlo approach including van der Waals interactions and the torsional barriers caused by covalent terms leads to an even higher MSD and a more accurate structure. For this last cases, the system was built with sp3 torsional potential from Dreiding (Equation 13 in reference [38]) and Lennard- Jones interactions between all atoms to a cutoff of 6Å. The as-built structure was then relaxed in a gradual, 10-step, procedure where van der Waals interactions are turned on slowly. At each step we performed 500 conjugate gradient steps and 500 molecular dynamics steps at a temperature T=600 K. The properties of the resulting structure are shown as dashed lines in Fig. 10. Finally, we performed an additional thermalization with MD for 50,000 steps under isothermal, isochoric conditions at 600 K. The MSD of the structure after the MD simulations is shown as a solid line in Fig. 10. Consistent with the findings by Auhl et al. we find that\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",

      "a gradual relaxation procedure results in structures that maintain their statistical properties during relaxation and dynamics. Such structures produced by the Poly- merModeler builder with sp3 torsions and Lennard-Jones interactions followed by a gradual introduction of non-bond interactions are expected to be good starting points for MD simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the MSD, the radial distribution function g(r) for chains con- structed by PolymerModeler demonstrates good equilibration and good agreement with neutron diffraction experiments. Figure 11 shows the radial distribution func- tion, g(r), for backbone carbon atoms in 100 isotactic PMMA chains built at 0.6 g/cm3, fully relaxed with the 10 steps of minimization, after 400 ps of MD at 600K. The peaks corresponding to nearest neighbor distances are labeled. In- dicators at 4.8Å and 8.6Å are included in figure 11 for comparison with Figure 7(a) in Ref. [47], which shows a similar g(r) calculation for the backbone atoms of syndiotactic PMMA. The indicators correspond to intrachain peaks (4.8Å) and in- terchain peaks (8.6Å) identified in PMMA by neutron scattering data. Structures built and equilibrated by PolymerModeler compare well to these results.\n",

In order to compute Tg the relaxed structure is cooled down to room temperature under constant pressure conditions. We control the temperature and pressure of the system using Nosé-Hoover thermostat and barostat with coupling timescales of 0.1 ps and 1 ps respectively.

      "Figure 12 shows the resulting density as a function of temperature during cool- ing. The thermal contraction that results from the anharmonicity in the interaction potentials is clearly seen. More importantly for our study is the change is slope that can be observed around 420 K. This denotes the glass transition where the system transforms from a melt to a glassy solid. The molten state above Tg has a higher thermal expansion coefficient that the solid below it. The predicted value of Tg is in good agreement with experimental values 388 K[48] and 385 K[49]. When comparing MD and experimental glass transition temperatures the effect of cooling/heating rate should be considered. The glass transition temperature in- creases with increasing heating/cooling rate and this increase is approximately 3K per order of magnitude increase in rate[50, 51, 52].\n",

      "The PolymerModeler tool at nanoHUB.org features an amorphous builder that allows customized specification of monomers, including multiple monomers and monomer patterns to support stereochemistry. Chain conformations are deter- mined by specifying the torsion angle probabilities of backbone atoms. The well-known cases of freely rotating and self-avoiding chains are accurately re- produced by the builder. Structural properties of systems built by the Polymer- Modeler builder compare well with systems built by commercial packages and current state-of-the-art techniques.\n",

      "After a system of polymer chains is built it may be relaxed, thermalized, deformed, and otherwise simulated using LAMMPS directly from the Polymer- Modeler tool.

The PAPER_CONTENT particularly emphasizes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for predicting thermomechanical properties.\n",
      "3. The PAPER_CONTENT mentions the use of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and similar tools but does not explicitly mention Thermomechanical Analysis (TMA), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), or Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). These methods are relevant in the broader context of experimental validation but are not highlighted in the paper itself.\n",

The tool, accessible via nanoHUB.org, is designed for easy and widespread use, requiring only an internet connection and a simple registration. PolymerModeler simplifies the generation of amorphous, linear-chain polymer structures, and sets up molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict their thermomechanical and structural properties using the LAMMPS simulation engine.\n",

      "The paper details the specific steps involved in building polymer chains, including the specification of monomers, chain configurations, and simulation cells. It describes the continuous configurational bias Monte Carlo method used for initial structure creation and subsequent relaxation steps to eliminate bad contacts. The tool supports detailed molecular dynamics simulations, offering high configurability in terms of simulation parameters and the ability to run on multiple processors.\n",

      "PolymerModeler has been validated by comparing simulation results with known analytical solutions and experimental data, including the prediction of the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The tool aims to be both an educational and research resource, providing a powerful and accessible alternative to commercial polymer simulation software. Future enhancements are planned based on user feedback and evolving research needs.\n",

      "### Future Directions and Challenges in Polymer Degradability Research\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymer degradability research stands at a crucial juncture, with remarkable technological advancements on one hand and daunting challenges on the other. As the 21st century grapples with environmental sustainability issues, understanding and improving polymer degradability becomes essential. This section will explore the emerging trends, computational limitations, and future research opportunities in this field.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Emerging Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most notable trends in polymer degradability research is the integration of machine learning (ML) and atomistic calculations. Machine learning approaches, such as those employing message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), have shown improved prediction accuracy for polymer properties by utilizing graph-based representations (Antoniuk et al., 2022). Recent advancements suggest a substantial reduction in prediction errors through the use of periodic polymer graphs, which accurately capture the unique structural characteristics of polymers (Antoniuk, Li, Kailkhura, Hiszpanski, 2022). Combined with high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these tools enable rapid screening and optimization of polymer materials with favorable degradation profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another trend is the development of sustainable and recyclable polymers, such as vitrimers. These materials, characterized by dynamic covalent networks, exhibit self-healing properties and can be recycled through simple chemical processes (Zheng et al., 2024). By employing AI-guided inverse design, researchers have successfully synthesized novel vitrimers, expanding the paradigms of sustainable polymer chemistry.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Computational Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these advancements, computational methodologies in polymer degradability research face significant limitations. One primary challenge is the high computational cost associated with MD simulations. While tools like PolymerModeler facilitate MD simulations in the cloud, the computational power required remains substantial, especially for large-scale systems (Haley et al., 2015). Additionally, there are challenges related to accurately modeling the long-term degradation behavior of polymers due to the complex interplay between chemical, physical, and environmental factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the accuracy of ML models is highly contingent on the quality and quantity of training data. Polymer databases are often incomplete or biased towards certain types of polymers, which can skew model predictions. Moreover, incorporating periodicity in polymer representations, while beneficial, adds complexity to model training and interpretation (Antoniuk et al., 2022). Therefore, developing more efficient algorithms that can handle these complexities without excessive computational overhead is critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Future Research Opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the existing limitations and leverage emerging technologies, several pathways for future research are evident. Firstly, enhancing the synergy between experimental and computational research can significantly propel the field forward. By validating computational predictions with experimental data, researchers can refine models and improve their predictive accuracy. Initiatives like creating comprehensive, high-quality databases of polymer degradation properties will be invaluable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another promising area is the exploration of biodegradable polymers designed with tunable degradation rates. By optimizing the chemical structure and incorporating bio-derived monomers, researchers can develop polymers that degrade more efficiently in specific environments. Integrating ML with chemical intuition to design such polymers can bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and practical applications (Zheng et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Collaborative efforts between academia, industry, and government bodies can accelerate the commercialization of sustainable polymers. By fostering interdisciplinary research and establishing regulatory frameworks, the translation of lab-scale innovations to market-ready products can be facilitated.\n",

      "One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials. Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, as well as how to automatically develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Specifically, our pipeline for polymer property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations with a sizable 20% average reduction in prediction error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding periodicity into our polymer graph representation is responsible for a considerable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while achieving better predictive performance than human-derived features. Whereas previous polymer informatics have typically utilized hand-designed descriptors that have been optimized for representing molecules, this work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.\n",

      "The complex chemical structure of polymers provides chemists with an unprecedented level of chemical design opportunities. As a result, efforts focused on the rational design of polymers has led to their use in a remarkably wide range of applications.1,2 By varying a polymer's monomer structure, its propagation site, or the polymer chain length, the properties of the polymer can be tuned to suit the application of interest.3 6 Formulations of polymers with chemical additives adds an even richer potential design and functional space. However, efficiently navigating this vast chemical design space to identify promising polymer materials for a given application is incredibly challenging. Recently, the field of polymer informatics has shown much promise in tackling this challenge by utilizing machine learning (ML) models to learn the complex structure-property relationships of polymers.7,8 Through the development of increasingly accurate ML models, one can envision the future possibility of fully computational polymer design workflows whereby polymers can be rapidly designed in silico to satisfy multiple property criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate machine learning models require that the input to the model - be it an image, text, or chemical structure - is transformed into a machine-readable format that captures and represents all relevant features of the input. The development of suitable polymer representations to use as inputs for machine learning algorithms has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in the field of polymer informatics.9,10 Unlike molecules that consist of a fixed number of atoms and typically only contain dozens of atoms, a given polymer can consist of a periodic chain of between 100-106 repeating chemical sub-units.11\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents a considerable challenge for creating machine-readable polymer representations since they must encode the periodic nature of the polymer structure and also be compact enough to represent up to millions of atoms. Despite these challenges, previous work on small molecules and crystalline solids has demonstrated that developing physically-inspired representations of atomistic systems is a fruitful direction towards realizing significant improvements in property prediction accuracy.12-15\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we develop a new polymer representation that is the first to explicitly capture the periodic nature of polymeric materials. First, we show that the widely used monomer-based representations cannot sufficiently describe the periodic, extended structure of polymers and can result in unreliable property predictions. To solve this issue, we have developed a novel polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph and that naturally incorporates polymers' periodicity in its construction. Across a diverse spectrum of 10 unique polymer properties, we find that our polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous monomer-based representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction error. Finally, we demonstrate how our polymer graph representations can be combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework to automatically extract chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from a dataset of polymer properties. We find that these MPNN-learned polymer features yield more accurate property predictions than predetermined features that have been hand-crafted by chemists over years.\n",

      "Recently, a wide range of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately predict polymer properties in an a priori manner.16,17 These previous approaches typically represent polymers by their monomer repeat unit which is then converted into either i) molecular descriptors that includes the presence of molecular fragments and/or property descriptors (such as the molecular weight of the molecule)18-20 or ii) a molecular graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds are represented as edges (Figure 1a)).17 It should be noted that these representations were first developed for molecules before being transferred to the field of polymer informatics. Although these monomer-based representations perform well at representing finite molecules, we show in this work that monomer-based representations cannot adequately represent the extended chain structures that define polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using monomer-based representations as inputs for ML algorithms results in at least three notable issues: i) the generation of non-unique representations for polymers that are composed of the similar monomer repeat units (see \"monomer graphs\" of Polymer A and B in Figure 1 c), ii) incorrect bonding environment of the polymer, and iii) a lack of periodicity. Polymers A and B in Figure 1c) are two distinct polymers with notably different chemical structures and properties. Since the monomer of a polymer is defined as the smallest repeat unit of the polymer chain, the monomer of the two polymers in Figure 1 c) is therefore the same C-C-O subunit (or CH3 CH2OH if including hydrogen atoms). Regardless of the specific details of the featurization used, generating a representation of Polymer A and B based only on their monomers will result in two identical representations (see Supplementary Note 1). In turn, an ML algorithm that then uses these representations to learn a structure-property relationship will, at best, only be able to learn the average value of the property across the polymers, which may lead to large prediction errors. The second issue that will arise from the use of monomer-based representations is the incorrect featurization of the polymer. Polymer B consists of a repeating (-C-C-O-) backbone, which is characterized by an ether functional group (R-O-R, where R is any alkane). However, the monomer of Polymer B ( C-C-O) does not contain an ether functional group since this ether group is artificially fragmented when forming the monomer representation. This is particularly problematic since both fingerprinting approaches and property descriptors utilize the presence of functional groups and connectivity in their representations (Supplementary Note 1).21-23 Thirdly, the failure to include periodicity in these monomer-based representations results in representations that are inconsistent due to trivial translations along the polymer backbone. The polymer (-C-C-O-)n can also be written as (-C-O-C-)n by translating all atoms one position along the polymer chain. However, the monomer representations for these two equivalent polymer representations would be C-C-O and C-O-C, respectively. As shown in this example, the failure to explicitly account for periodicity in these monomer-based representations can result in inconsistent featurizations, which can negatively impact the ability of ML algorithms to learn the underlying structure-property relationships. These inconsistent featurizations are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamentally, all three of the aforementioned problems arise due to a failure to account for the periodic nature of polymers. In other words, a finite molecule (i.e. a monomer) cannot be used to represent a continuous, extended chain of atoms without fragmenting chemical bonds in an unphysical manner. We note that featurizing Polymers A and B by generating dimers (or any larger oligomer chain) instead of monomers results in unique representations. Using a dimer representation, however, still results in incorrect featurizations due to the incomplete bonding environment of the atoms at the terminal end of the dimer.\n",

      "In this work, we introduce a new polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph that solves all three of these problems. The core idea of the polymer graph is that adding a bond between the two terminal ends of the polymer chain creates a periodic polymer representation (Figure 1b)). The periodic nature of this representation eliminates the need for artificially cleaving chemical bonds, ensuring that the correct bonding environment is maintained for all atoms in the polymer. We note that this approach is strongly reminiscent of the crystal graph representations that has had wide success in representing periodic crystalline materials that extend indefinitely in all three dimensions.12 Crystal graph representations have solved the problem of representing an infinite 3-D crystal by treating it as the smallest repeat unit (referred to as the unit cell) that then transmits chemical information by interacting with periodic copies of itself in all directions. In an analogous fashion, the polymer graph developed in this work is formed from the repeat unit of the polymer that is able to transmit chemical information through the added periodic bond. We emphasize that this periodic bond is used only for representing the polymer, but should not be interpreted to mean that the polymers are always part of a chemical ring system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph-based representations of molecules and crystalline solids have recently been the subject of considerable research efforts and are currently the state-of-the-art representation for predicting the properties of these systems. 13,24,25 Generally these graphs represent each atom in the chemical system, i, by an atom embedding vector (hi) which is updated through messages that are sent through the edges of the graph. These update messages typically operate on all atoms and bonds in the local neighbor- hood of atom i, where the local neighborhood is given by the edges of the graph that are connected to atom i. To generate our polymer graph representation, we first create a standard trimer graph and then add an additional edge to connect the two terminal atoms of the trimer (Figure 1 b)). This added edge in our polymer graph representation not only maintains the correct bonding environment for all atoms, but also serves to ensure that messages (i.e. chemical information) can be sent throughout the polymer graph. For example, the left-most carbon atom in the monomer graph in Figure 1a) will only directly receive messages from the central carbon atom since this is the only atom that it is bonded to. This is not an accurate representation of the true chemical structure of this polymer since this carbon atom is directly bonded to both a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. On the other hand, since our polymer graph representation creates an edge between the terminal carbon and oxygen atoms, messages are directly passed between both of these two atoms, thus allowing the atom embedding vector of the terminal carbon atom to more accurately represent its true chemical environment. We construct the polymer graph from a trimer graph (rather than a dimer or monomer graph) to ensure that the added periodic bond is between atoms that are distinct and not already bonded to each other.\n",

      "\n",
      "To demonstrate the accuracy and generality of our polymer graph representation for predicting polymer properties, we collect a dataset of polymer properties containing 15,219 datapoints across 10 distinct properties (see Methods for dataset details). Notably, this dataset includes a diverse set of property types (thermal, structural, optical, electronic) as well as data collected from both experimental and computational sources, which allows us to assess the capability of our approach to learn meaningful polymer representations for general property prediction tasks. To perform a baseline comparison, we also train ML models on all 10 properties with two commonly used monomer-based representations: i) molecular descriptors and ii) molecular graphs of the monomer (Table 1). All graph-based models are trained with a MPNN model, whereas a random forest (RF) model is used for training with the monomer descriptors (see Methods for model architecture and hyperparameter details).\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing the performance of the RF/Molecular Descriptors and the MPNN/Monomer Graph in Table 1 illustrates the increase in performance that is realized when using graph-based models for polymer property prediction. Across 8 out of 10 properties, the MPNN/Monomer graph model outperforms the RF/Molecular Descriptors model. On average, the MPNN/Monomer Graph model achieves 12 % lower error than the RF/Molecular Descriptors model, with remarkably large reductions in error for predicting atomization energy (43%), band gap bulk (17%), and electron affinity (32%). Both models perform similarly at predicting ionization energy, whereas the RF/Molecular Descriptors model performs slightly better only at predicting the crystallization tendency. The poor performance of the monomer graph model for predicting crystallization tendency may be due to the fact that these values were calculated with the use of an approximate group contribution method.26 The low fidelity of this dataset may therefore be preventing the graph model from learning reasonable atom/bond features for predicting crystallization tendency. Based on the results across all properties, we conclude that graph-based models can generally be expected to perform, at worst, comparably to RF/Molecular Descriptor models, with the potential to perform significantly better on certain properties. This finding is in agreement with a previous report which showed that monomer graph-based models outperform ECFP molecular descriptors for predicting the glass transition temperature, melting temperature, density, and elastic modulus for a subclass of polymers known as polyamides.17 In the present work, we expand this finding to show that graph-based models can generally be expected to outperform models based on molecular descriptors across a broader range of polymer properties and for datasets that contain all subclasses of polymers.\n",

      "Now that we have demonstrated the ability of graph-based models to perform well at predicting polymer properties, we now explore how the construction of the graph itself can influence model performance. Table 1 illustrates the performance of monomer graph and polymer graph representations with the same MPNN model. Although we have already demonstrated that the MPNN/Monomer Graph model considerably outperforms the current state-of-the-art RF/Molecular Descriptor models, we find that using our polymer graph representation results in a further 10% average reduction in error compared to the monomer graph model and does not perform significantly worse than the monomer graph model for any of the properties. The polymer graph representation results in a significant reduction in error for predicting atomization error (33%), band gap chain (15%), ionization energy (19%) and glass transition temperature (10%), compared to the monomer graph representation. Since the improvement in property prediction accuracy achieved by the polymer graph is highly property-dependant, we note that the 10% average reduction in error reported here is likely to vary depending on the chosen set of properties of interest. Nevertheless, we do not find any properties where the polymer graph performs significantly worse than the monomer graph representation, leading us to conclude that the polymer graph should be expected to yield more accurate property predictions across a wide range of properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our original hypothesis to motivate the development of our polymer graph representation was that it can improve over monomer graph representations by being able to distinguish between polymers that have the same monomer representation. To test this idea, we construct a test set of 179 glass transition temperature (Tg) datapoints where each polymer in the dataset has at least one other polymer that contains the same monomer representation, as depicted by polymers A-C in Figure 2. We train a MPNN/Monomer Graph model and a MPNN/Polymer Graph model on a Tg training set that does not include these 179 polymers and then evaluate their ability to predict the Tg of the 179 polymers in the test set. This experiment therefore allows us to quantify the impact on prediction accuracy that results from the inability of monomer graphs to distinguish between polymers that have the same monomer representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As illustrated in Figure 2, the inability of the MPNN/Monomer graph model to distinguish between polymers A-C results in the same Tg prediction for all three polymers. Since the experimental Tg value varies largely between these three polymers, this results in an unacceptably large prediction error of over 60℃. Although polymers A-C are chosen as an illustrative example, a more statistically significant comparison can be obtained from the performance on the entire test set of 179 polymers. Consistent with our original hypothesis, we see that the inability of the monomer graph representation to distinguish between the polymers in this test set results in significantly worse performance when compared to Table 1 (49°C vs. 39℃). On the other hand, the polymer graph representation is not only able to distinguish between these polymers, but also quantitatively capture the trends in Tg values for polymers A-C with a RMSE that is nearly 60% less than that of the monomer graph. These results therefore\n",

By being able to distinguish between polymers of the same monomer structure, the polymer graph representation is therefore better able to learn quantitative structure-property relationships for the properties in Table 1. Since the proportion of polymers that have the same monomer structure is relatively small ( 2% of the Tg dataset), we anticipate that this effect is currently small, but will grow in importance as more polymers are discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of the experiment shown in Figure 2 also have important practical implications for the reliability that can be expected when using ML methods to discover new polymers. The Tg of a polymer is the temperature at which the thermal motions of the polymers are large enough to overcome the forces that hold the amorphous polymer together, such that the polymer is able to undergo large-scale molecular motions.27 Accurately predicting the glass transition temperature is therefore of great importance since Tg is often treated as the maximum temperature that the polymer can be used.28 Despite having identical chemical compositions, the three polymers shown in Figure 2 exhibit a remarkably broad range of experimental Tg values due to their unique chemical structures. In particular, the presence of the hydroxyl (OH) group on Polymer A leads to an increase in interchain attractive forces, resulting in a significantly larger Tg value than for Polymers B and C.29 The inability of monomer-based graph representations to distinguish between these polymers therefore severely hurts the trustworthiness of the model. If one were to use the MPNN/Monomer Graph model to discover new polymers, the large errors in this subset of Tg predictions could manifest in the discovery of polymers that are thermodynamically unstable at the desired operating temperature. By comparison, the consistent performance seen by the MPNN/Polymer Graph model helps to instill confidence that the predictions will be robust across a large dataset of polymer materials.\n",

      "Although the results in Table 1 and Figure 2 suggest that the polymer graph representation can more accurately predict polymer properties than both the monomer graph and molecular descriptor representations, they do not fully explain what is causing this improvement in performance. Understanding specifically how polymer representation can impact predictive performance is important for the development of increasingly better polymer representations. To accomplish this goal, we perform several ablation experiments whereby we systematically alter components of the polymer graph representation to allow us to quantify the contribution of each component to overall model performance (Figure 3). We conduct this experiment by training the same MPNN model as before on the same 10 properties listed in Table 1. For clarity, we illustrate the performance of each representation by calculating the average performance across all properties (Figure 3). The property-specific performance of each representation is given in Table S1.\n",

This result is perhaps unsurprising since the trimer graph does not provide any additional chemical information compared to the dimer graph representation. Based on this finding, we anticipate that using even larger graph representations (i.e. tetramer or pentamer) will not improve model performance, but will unnecessarily require more computational resources for model training. Finally, comparing the performance of the dimer graph and the monomer graph representations illustrates that including more than one repeat unit in the graph significantly improves performance. It may seem counter-intuitive that the trimer graph and dimer graph representations perform similarly, whereas dimer graph representations considerably outperform monomer graph representations. However, this result can be explained by noting that the dimer graph representation contains additional chemical bonding information, relative to the monomer graph, since it directly represents the atoms that are bonded together to form the polymer chain. On the other hand, the trimer/dimer graph representations do not differ in the chemical information that they contain, but are simply scaled versions of each other.\n",

      "\n",
      "We note from the ablation experiments illustrated in Figure 3 that the largest reduction in error relative to the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline is due to using graph-based representations with the MPNN model. Using graph-based models results in at least a 13% average reduction in error, relative to the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline, whereas further refinements to the graph representation only affects the average performance by approximately 3-5%. To better understand why using graph-based representations in combination with a MPNN architecture leads to such a significant performance improvement, we analyze the learned feature vectors that are generated from the MPNN model. The MPNN model utilized in this work uses learned bond and atom features that are aggregated into a single fixed-length vector. This aggregated vector is then passed through a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers to generate the final property prediction. As a result, the vector in the final hidden layer of this feed-forward neural network can be considered as a learned encoding of the polymer that has been optimized by the MPNN model to make accurate property predictions. These vector encodings can therefore be analyzed to determine what chemical information the MPNN model is using to generate its predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline used previously (Table 1) utilizes pre-determined molecular descriptors (such as molecular weight), the vector encodings extracted from our MPNN model are vector representations that have been specifically optimized for the particular property that they are trained on. Comparing the performance of the RF/Monomer Descriptors baseline and a RF model trained with these learned encodings therefore allows us to quantitatively understand if the superior performance of the graph-based models are due to these optimized encodings or the MPNN model architecture. To perform this experiment, we train the MPNN model on k-1 folds (k=5) of the Tg dataset. This trained MPNN model is then used to generate vector encodings for the polymers in the same k-1 folds of the dataset. Then, these vector encodings are used as inputs to train the RF model on the same k-1 folds of the dataset that the MPNN model was trained on. Finally, the test performance of the RF model is calculated for the remaining fold of the dataset that was not seen by the MPNN model nor the RF model in training. This procedure is repeated for k iterations to ensure that each fold of the dataset is used as the test set once and the reported performance is averaged across these k iterations. This training procedure prevents data leakage by ensuring that the test set is not seen by the MPNN model or the RF model before determining test performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of this experiment are given in Figure 4a). Remarkably, we find that the RF model with learned descriptors performs comparably to the MPNN/Polymer Graph model at predicting Tg. This result suggests that the excellent performance of the MPNN/Polymer Graph model is not due to MPNNs being a more powerful model architecture. Rather, the learned descriptors that the MPNN model extracts provides a more meaningful representation of polymers, leading to superior predictive capability. This finding is exciting because it suggests that the use of learned polymer representations that better capture the underlying chemical properties of polymers can lead to greatly improved predictive capabilities, even with relatively simple model architectures like random forests. It is important to note that the predetermined molecular descriptors that have been previously used for polymer prediction tasks were first developed as general descriptors for molecules, but with no guarantee that these descriptors will contain properties that are relevant for describing polymer properties.21 On the other hand, these learned MPNN descriptors are specifically trained to capture the relevant components of a polymer's structure that give rise to its properties. In this way, the MPNN model explored in this work provides a recipe for automatically extracting meaningful polymer representations directly from polymer property datasets in a manner that does not require any hand-crafted featurization.\n",

      "layer of the MPNN/Polymer Graph model and the predetermined molecular descriptors for the polymers in the Tg dataset. The 5 molecular descriptors that are most correlated with the MPNN learned features for the MPNN/Polymer Graph model are depicted in Figure 4b). Two of the most important known structural features for predicting Tg in polymers is: i) the presence of polar functional groups such as NH2 and OH that increase intermolecular forces, resulting in a higher Tg value and ii) the stiffness of the polymer chain, which is typically described in terms of the presence of rigid ring structures in the polymer backbone.27 The molecular descriptors shown in Figure 4b) are colored according to which one of these two known structural factors they explicitly capture. Interestingly, we see that the majority of the learned MPNN features are strongly correlated with these known relevant chemical features, which suggests that our MPNN model is autonomously learning the chemical features that are responsible for Tg directly from the dataset of Tg values. In particular, the most heavily weighted MPNN feature is correlated with the presence of polar groups, whereas the other top 5 features provide complex descriptions of the presence of ring structures in the polymer. However, we emphasize that these MPNN polymer encodings also contain new information that is not captured by the predetermined descriptors, as is shown by the superior performance of the RF model when using learned descriptors instead of predetermined descriptors (Figure 4a).\n",

      "Generally, this work has demonstrated how the development of representations that better account for the unique and complex chemical structure of polymers can be a powerful strategy for increasing the accuracy of polymer property predictions. Through a number of illustrative examples, we have demonstrated how a failure to account for periodicity in polymers can lead to property predictions that are inaccurate and unreliable. We have shown that these issues can be mitigated by our novel polymer graph representation that explicitly accounts for the inherent periodicity of polymeric materials. The results presented here therefore demonstrate that utilizing chemical intuition to construct physically-informed polymer representations is a viable strategy for advancing the predictive capabilities of ML models.\n",

      "The polymer informatics community has benefited greatly from the adaptation of machine learning algorithms and representations that were first developed for molecules. This approach is based on the assumption that general molecular descriptors are likely to work well across a broad spectrum of chemical classes, including polymers. In this work, we test this assumption by exploring the improvement in property predictions that can be achieved through the use of learned descriptors that are specifically optimized to capture the unique structural characteristics of polymers. We have shown that utilizing polymer-specific descriptors results in considerable improvements in the accuracy of polymer property predictions, compared to standard molecular descriptors. These results suggest that the structural characteristics that give rise to polymer properties are distinct from general molecular descriptors. This is perhaps unsurprising since it is well known that polymers are affected by structural elements that do not have molecular analogues, such as the branching structure of the polymer or its interchain interactions. We anticipate that the continued development of representations that are customized to capture the unique and complex structure of polymeric systems is therefore a fruitful direction for further pushing the limits of predicting polymer properties with ML.\n",

The size of the bond message vectors is set to 300 and a total of 3 message-passing steps are used. The feed-forward neural network consists of 2 hidden layers, each consisting of 300 hidden neurons. All hyperparameters used are the Chemprop default values. We point interested readers to the Chemprop documentation for an extensive list of all hyperparameters used in this architecture.13 Unless otherwise stated, all models are trained with 5-fold cross-validation (CV) for 50 epochs on each fold.

      "To illustrate the inconsistencies that arise when using preexisting molecular descriptors to represent polymers, Figure S1 provides a visualize of the molecular descriptors generated from RDKit for 4 representative SMILES strings. According to the syntax of the SMILES strings, the '*' character is used to indicate the connection between repeating units of a polymer. The SMILES notation also does not explicitly indicate hydrogen atoms, but instead assumes that all atoms have the number of hydrogen atoms required for full valency. The '*CCO*' SMILES string therefore represents a (-CH2-CH2-O-)n polymer and the '*COC*' SMILES string represents the same polymer, (-CH2-O-CH2-)n, that has been trivially translated along the polymer backbone. Even though '*CCO*' and '*COC*' represent the same polymer, Figure S1 illustrates the different feature vectors that are generated from these SMILES strings. An understanding of why this difference arises can be obtained by looking at the molecular fragment features that are generated for these two SMILES string. The only difference in the molecular fragment features is the 'fr_ether' feature, which is a binary feature that indicates the presence of an ether functional group. As shown in Figure S1, the '*CCO*' has fr_ether=0 (indicating the absence of an ether), whereas '*COC*' has fr_ether=1 (indicating the presence of an ether). Evidently, the inconsistent featurization between these two chemically identical SMILES strings is due to a lack of periodicity. Since the '*CCO*' SMILES string does not treat the terminal oxygen atom as being bonded to two neighboring carbon atoms, using the '*CCO*' SMILES string results in an incorrect featurization of fr_ether=0, when this polymer does in fact contain an ether.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of including the '*' character in the SMILES representation is illustrated with feature vectors of the 'CCO' and 'COC' SMILES strings, which are the monomer subunits of '*CCO*' and '*COC*', respectively. Interestingly, all four of these inputs yield four different feature vectors. Although these inconsistencies could be accounted for by designating a standardized SMILES string to use as an input for a given polymer, it is unlikely that such a standardized system would always capture the correct periodicity of the polymer. Instead, the use of the polymer graph representation as described in the main text ensures that the periodicity of the polymer is maintained and always generates a consistent representation.\n",

      "Welcome to our comprehensive exploration into the cutting-edge field of polymer degradability enhanced by atomistic calculations. The increasing environmental awareness and demand for sustainable materials have thrust the research on polymer degradation into the limelight. Polymers, being versatile and ubiquitous, contribute significantly to our modern lifestyle, but their longevity poses substantial disposal challenges. It is here that degradability becomes a crucial factor, dictating the lifecycle and environmental footprint of polymeric materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymers degrade through various chemical and physical processes, breaking down into simpler substances over time. Factors influencing this include intrinsic material properties, environmental conditions, and the presence of catalysts or microorganisms. Understanding these factors at a molecular level can not only enhance degradability but also lead to the design of novel materials tailored for specific end-of-life scenarios.\n",

      "This is where atomistic calculations, an essential aspect of computational chemistry, play a pivotal role. Atomistic simulations involve computational techniques that model and predict the behavior of materials at the scale of atoms and molecules. They provide an unparalleled level of detail, allowing researchers to visualize and analyze the molecular dynamics and interactions within polymers. By employing atomistic calculations, scientists can predict how polymer structures will react under various conditions, paving the way for the creation of more sustainable and degradable materials.\n",

      "\n",
      "The ability to predict the behavior of polymers on an atomistic level is grounded in robust theoretical principles, primarily quantum mechanics, which offer insightful frameworks for modeling molecular interactions. This section details the essence of these principles, with a focus on Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT), two quintessential techniques in atomistic simulations. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Principles of Quantum Mechanics\n",
      "Quantum mechanics provides the fundamental theoretical underpinnings for understanding the interactions at the atomic scale. At the heart of quantum mechanics are wavefunctions that describe the quantum state of a system. Schrödinger's equation, which governs the behavior of these wavefunctions, is critical for determining the properties of atoms and molecules. For example, the Schrödinger equation allows for the computation of electronic structures and interaction potentials, which are paramount in understanding material properties at the atomic level.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Dynamics (MD)\n",
      "Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a simulation technique used to study the physical movements of atoms and molecules. By solving Newton’s equations of motion for a system of interacting particles, MD provides trajectories of atoms and molecules over time. One can think of MD as a detailed, atom-by-atom animation of molecular interactions. \n",
      "\n",
      "MD is particularly effective in studying the dynamic behavior of polymers, including their folding, crystallization, and degradation processes. The method relies on force fields – mathematical models that describe the potential energy of a system. For instance, studies involving the PolymerModeler tool, available through nanoHUB.org, have demonstrated the use of MD in predicting various properties of polymers, such as transport properties and mechanical responses, by providing users control over parameters like time steps, temperature, and simulation ensembles (Haley et al., 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Density Functional Theory (DFT)\n",
      "DFT is an essential tool for modeling the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and solids. Unlike classical MD, DFT incorporates quantum mechanical principles to determine the probability distributions of electrons in a system. The fundamental concept of DFT lies in approximating the many-body problem of interacting electrons with a system of non-interacting particles subject to an effective potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "DFT has been crucial in studying the chemical reactions and stability of polymers. For instance, the computational studies on the carbonization process of polymers such as PAN (polyacrylonitrile) involve using DFT calculations to understand reaction energies and molecular stability during thermal degradation (Chen et al., 2019). These calculations are pivotal in comparing different polymer configurations and predicting their behavior under various conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Computational Requirements and Challenges\n",
      "Conducting MD and DFT simulations demands substantial computational resources. MD simulations, which may involve thousands to millions of particles, require significant computational power and time, especially for long-duration simulations that ensure realistic modeling of molecular behavior. DFT, on the other hand, although being less computationally intensive compared to full quantum mechanical simulations, still requires significant processing capabilities due to the complexity of electronic interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts to optimize computational efficiency involve parallel processing and the use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources. Moreover, challenges such as the need for precise force fields in MD and the approximations in exchange-correlation functionals in DFT are subjects of ongoing research. Increased accuracy in modeling requires continual refinement of these computational tools and methods, often validated against experimental data.\n",

MD (denoted by blue) tends to be less complex computationally but is versatile across larger scale systems. DFT (denoted by orange) requires higher computational power, excelling at detailed electronic structure calculations at smaller scales.\n",

      "Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is an amorphous polymer widely used in applications ranging from optical devices to prosthetics. A significant study leveraged the capabilities of PolymerModeler on nanoHUB.org to perform atomistic simulations on PMMA. The study used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the structural properties of PMMA, such as the glass transition temperature (Tg) and mechanical response. The sequential addition of monomers using a continuous configurational bias Monte Carlo method enabled the creation of polymer chains with realistic configurations. These simulations showed good structural agreement with experimental data, highlighting the utility of atomistic calculations in validating polymer properties (Haley et al., 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Case Study 2: Vitrimer Polymers\n",
      "Another compelling example involves vitrimers, a class of polymers known for their recyclability due to dynamic covalent networks. A recent study integrated atomistic calculations with machine learning to design novel vitrimer chemistries with targeted Tg. By generating a vitrimer dataset of over one million chemistries and performing high-throughput MD simulations, researchers were able to predict Tg values effectively. Experimental synthesis of a novel vitrimer polymer guided by these predictions confirmed the accuracy of the Tg values, showcasing the power of atomistic calculations in advancing sustainable polymer design (Zheng et al., 2023).\n",

Parameters like time step, number of steps, and temperature can be configured to tailor simulations to specific studies. \n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, in the simulation of PMMA, configurations were generated using Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling, considering van der Waals interactions to produce self-avoiding chains.

In the vitrimer study, high-throughput MD simulations predicted the Tg of various polymer chemistries, which were then synthesized and tested experimentally. The vitrimer with a predicted Tg of 323 K was synthesized and exhibited a Tg of 311-317 K in laboratory conditions, underscoring the reliability of atomistic predictions. The vitrimer's ability to heal and flow as predicted further validated the approach (Zheng et al., 2023).\n",

      "### Future Directions and Challenges in Polymer Degradability Research\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymer degradability research stands at a crucial juncture, with remarkable technological advancements on one hand and daunting challenges on the other. As the 21st century grapples with environmental sustainability issues, understanding and improving polymer degradability becomes essential. This section will explore the emerging trends, computational limitations, and future research opportunities in this field.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Emerging Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most notable trends in polymer degradability research is the integration of machine learning (ML) and atomistic calculations. Machine learning approaches, such as those employing message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), have shown improved prediction accuracy for polymer properties by utilizing graph-based representations (Antoniuk et al., 2022). Recent advancements suggest a substantial reduction in prediction errors through the use of periodic polymer graphs, which accurately capture the unique structural characteristics of polymers (Antoniuk, Li, Kailkhura, Hiszpanski, 2022). Combined with high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these tools enable rapid screening and optimization of polymer materials with favorable degradation profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another trend is the development of sustainable and recyclable polymers, such as vitrimers. These materials, characterized by dynamic covalent networks, exhibit self-healing properties and can be recycled through simple chemical processes (Zheng et al., 2024). By employing AI-guided inverse design, researchers have successfully synthesized novel vitrimers, expanding the paradigms of sustainable polymer chemistry.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Computational Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these advancements, computational methodologies in polymer degradability research face significant limitations. One primary challenge is the high computational cost associated with MD simulations. While tools like PolymerModeler facilitate MD simulations in the cloud, the computational power required remains substantial, especially for large-scale systems (Haley et al., 2015). Additionally, there are challenges related to accurately modeling the long-term degradation behavior of polymers due to the complex interplay between chemical, physical, and environmental factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the accuracy of ML models is highly contingent on the quality and quantity of training data. Polymer databases are often incomplete or biased towards certain types of polymers, which can skew model predictions. Moreover, incorporating periodicity in polymer representations, while beneficial, adds complexity to model training and interpretation (Antoniuk et al., 2022). Therefore, developing more efficient algorithms that can handle these complexities without excessive computational overhead is critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Future Research Opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the existing limitations and leverage emerging technologies, several pathways for future research are evident. Firstly, enhancing the synergy between experimental and computational research can significantly propel the field forward. By validating computational predictions with experimental data, researchers can refine models and improve their predictive accuracy. Initiatives like creating comprehensive, high-quality databases of polymer degradation properties will be invaluable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another promising area is the exploration of biodegradable polymers designed with tunable degradation rates. By optimizing the chemical structure and incorporating bio-derived monomers, researchers can develop polymers that degrade more efficiently in specific environments. Integrating ML with chemical intuition to design such polymers can bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and practical applications (Zheng et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Collaborative efforts between academia, industry, and government bodies can accelerate the commercialization of sustainable polymers. By fostering interdisciplinary research and establishing regulatory frameworks, the translation of lab-scale innovations to market-ready products can be facilitated.\n",
