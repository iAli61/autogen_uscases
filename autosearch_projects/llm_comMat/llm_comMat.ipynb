      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymers are omnipresent in our daily lives, forming the basis of numerous materials, ranging from plastic containers and synthetic fibers to high-tech applications in medicine and electronics. At their core, polymers are long chains of repeating molecular units, possessing unique properties that derive from their broad diversity of structures. Materials science has long capitalized on the versatility of polymers to engineer new substances tailored for specific functions. Understanding and optimizing these attributes is more than an academic pursuit; it is a fundamental challenge with profound implications for innovation and technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The significance of accurately representing polymers cannot be overstated. In recent years, the advent of polymer informatics and advanced computational techniques, such as those harnessing polymer design algorithms and active learning frameworks, has propelled materials science forward. These methodologies allow researchers to predict the properties of polymers with remarkable precision, aiding the discovery of novel materials with tailored character (Adams, 2009; Polymer informatics).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the complexity of polymers poses intricate challenges, particularly when considering their structure and dimensions within nanocomposites. The addition of nanoparticles to polymers has sparked considerable debate in the scientific community. Nanoparticles can profoundly influence polymer chains, affecting the material's overall properties such as mechanical strength, thermal stability, and conductivity (Paul & Robeson, 2008; Polymer nanotechnology: nanocomposites).\n",
      "\n",
      "Academic research highlights that interactions at the nanoscale can perturb polymer chains, altering their dynamics and organization, and thus impacting macroscopic material behavior (Schmid, 2022; Understanding and modeling polymers: The challenge of multiple scales). Capturing these effects requires a multi-scale approach, balancing detailed atomic-level interactions with the large-scale properties of polymer assemblies. These efforts not only deepen our understanding of polymers but also drive the design of next-generation materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1: [Include a relevant graph visualizing the multi-scale nature of polymers, from atomic to macroscopic scales, possibly depicting how nanoparticle addition affects polymer structure on different scales.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Addressing the problem of polymer structure in nanocomposites involves overcoming several hurdles. One is the need to characterize the mesoscale structure and its impact on local packing and thermal properties. Experimentally, techniques such as neutron scattering and advanced microscopy have shed light on these areas. Theoretically, novel computational models embracing non-equilibrium steady states have been devised (Computational studies, nanotechnology, and solution thermodynamics of polymer systems; Dadmun, Van Hook & Noid). In synthesis, researchers are engineering polymers with selective responsiveness to external stimuli, evidenced by the development of DNA-programmable polymer materials (Speed, Gupta & Peng, 2023; Programmable polymer materials empowered by DNA nanotechnology).\n",
      "\n",
      "As we navigate the intricate dance of polymer chains and nanoparticles, the transformation of raw data into actionable knowledge is pivotal. Taking cues from advancements in AI, such as those enhancing vision models for text-heavy content (TG et al., 2023; Enhancing Vision Models for Text-Heavy Content Understanding and Interaction), we integrate sophisticated algorithms to interpret complex polymer-related data.\n",
      "\n",
      "This blog, etching the contours of multiscale polymer representation and nanocomposite challenges, provides a platform for readers to grasp the current state of polymer science and its future trajectory. By delving into the depths of these issues, we'll explore how the interplay between polymers and nanoparticles inspires cutting-edge materials, leveraging robust and dynamically adaptive systems—the building blocks of tomorrow's material science breakthroughs.\n",

      "Based on the search results, there seem to be a number of academic papers that discuss the effects of nanoparticles on polymer structure across different scales. For the purpose of creating an informative and accurate plot, I will focus on a couple of papers that appear particularly relevant to providing data on how nanoparticles influence polymer structures at the atomic scale, mesoscale, and macroscopic scale. These include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Diffusion of nanoparticles in semidilute polymer solutions: effect of different length scales\" by I Kohli and A Mukhopadhyay, which may provide insight into how nanoparticles move in polymer solutions and affect polymer structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"Structure and dynamics of a polymer–nanoparticle composite: Effect of nanoparticle size and volume fraction\" by V Sorichetti, V Hugouvieux, and W Kob, which looks into the structure and dynamics of polymer-nanoparticle composites and may have data indicating structural perturbations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"Scaling perspective on dynamics of nanoparticles in polymers: length-and time-scale dependent nanoparticle–polymer coupling\" by T Ge, which discusses the scale-dependent behavior of nanoparticles within polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "To proceed with the analysis and obtain the necessary data, the full texts of these papers should be retrieved and thoroughly reviewed. This will enable us to understand the degree of nanoparticle-induced perturbation across the different scales specified. The data extracted may include the size or concentration of nanoparticles as well as their impact on polymer structure at atomic, meso, and macro levels, which could then be represented in the scatter plot.\n",

      "Multiscale problems are omnipresent in materi- als science. The properties of most materials typ- ically result from a combination of many processes on vastly different length and time scales, ranging from electronic excitations and atomic or molecular vibrations on the Angstrom and femtosecond scale to material fatigue on time scales over several years. In polymeric systems, disentangling the different char- acteristic scales scales that determine their behav- ior is particularly difficult. This is because the rele- vant molecular length scales - which range from the scale of the local chemical monomer structure to the scale of chain conformations - strongly overlap with the relevant length scales of the next level of inter- molecular and possibly supra-molecular organiza- tion, and these in turn overlap with the length scales of continuum mechanics on which materials are de- scribed in terms of elastohydrodynamic equations. Therefore, an all-inclusive, comprehensive modeling of a polymeric system [1] remains a formidable chal- lenge despite decades of theoretical efforts [2-16].\n",

      "In the present perspective article, we discuss some selected approaches to this problem, focussing on re- cent developments. Before doing so, we will quote a few examples of scale-bridging phenomena in poly- mers that inherently require multiscale descriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first and most basic example is the emerg- ing viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity in polymer rheology, a field where the multiscale character of polymer-based systems is immediately apparent [17]. Polymeric materials respond to applied stress with some time delay (memory), a clear signature of an incomplete separation of time scales. This is because the time scales of intramolecular (internal chain) re- laxation cannot be separated from the time scales of\n",
      "\n",
      "* friederike.schmid@uni-mainz.de\n",
      "\n",
      "diffusion and intermolecular re-organization, in par- ticular in the presence of entanglements [6].\n",
      "\n",
      "Another prominent classical multiscale phe- nomenon in polymer science is polymer crystalliza- tion [18], which involves local crystallization on the monomer scale, the formation of crystalline lamel- lae on the mesoscale, and the macroscale organi- zation of lamellae, often into spherulites [19]. Al- ready the local structure is not necessarily unique [20], but may result from a competition of several polymorphs depending on the processing [21]. Pre- dicting such polymorphs requires accurate theoreti- cal descriptions at the electronic structure level [19] as well as multiscale modelling approaches to en- able studying the kinetics of self-assembly [22, 23]. On the mesoscale, the mechanisms that determine and eventually constrain the growth of crystalline lamellae are still under debate [24]. One particu- lar intriguing phenomenon is the \"melt memory\" ef- fect [25, 26]: Even after melting a polymer crystal, the melt retains some knowledge about the previous structure and tends to re-crystallize at previously crystalline positions after cooling. Recent system- atic simulation studies by Luo, Sommer and oth- ers have suggested that the thickness of crystalline lamellae is determined by the entanglement length in the melt prior to crystallization [27-32] - consis- tent with the experimental observation that the time scale on which the melt memory survives roughly matches the time scale of re-entanglement kinetics [33]. Such findings illustrate how mesoscale struc- ture (entanglements) can have a profound effect on local structure (local packing), and vice versa, in polymers. The associated time scales can be very large, which offers unusually versatile opportunities to control local structure by processing [34], for ex- ample, in flow-induced crystallization [35-39], or by tiny chemical modifications [40, 41]. On the other hand, the mesoscale structure and dynamics deter- mines the elastic and plastic response of the materi- als to deformations [42, 43] and the inhomogeneous\n",
      "\n",
      "stress fields in the materials, which in term drive the large-scale structure formation and spherulite growth [44].\n",
      "\n",
      "The interplay of multiple scales also determines the structural and dynamic properties of other mul- tiphase polymer materials [45] that are highly het- erogeneous and filled by internal interfaces, such as polymer blends [46, 47], block copolymer melts and solutions [48-51], or foams [52]. It is particularly prominent in polymer nanocomposites [53-57], where fillers are introduced, e.g., to improve the mechani- cal properties of a polymeric matrix. The molecular origins of the resulting mechanical reinforcement are diverse, they include a redistribution of strain in the polymer matrix [58] as well as stretching of chains at the interfaces [59]. A detailed knowledge of the structure of the material on both local and meso- scopic scales is thus necessary to understand the macroscopic viscoelastic properties of the materials. Likewise, transport properties such as the thermal conductivity [60] depend on the microscopic struc- ture in the bulk matrix as well as at interfaces, i.e., the Kapitza resistance [61, 62], and on the mesoscale shape and spatial distribution of the fillers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, biomaterials provide some of the most so- phisticated polymer-based multiscale materials, due to their characteristic hierarchical structure. A well- known example is is spider silk [63, 64], which also serves as a good example how the properties of such materials crucially depend on the way how they has been processed (in this case spun) [65]. Other exam- ples are fibers made of collagen, which are abundant in mammals [66-69]. Collagen is found in the ex- tracellular matrix of tissues as different as skin, fas- cia, cartilage and bones, and is to a great extent responsible for their superior material properties. Twenty-nine types of collagen have been reported in the literature [66], the most frequent being colla- gen I, which is present in, e.g., dermis, tendon, and bone. The primary structure of collagen peptides is characterized by repeats of three residues Gly-X- Y, e.g., Gly-Pro-Hyp. The quaternary structure is a triple helix, where three polypeptide strands wrap around each other to form a helix of length ~ 300 nm, the tropocollagen. Staggered arrays of tropocolla- gen self-assemble (spontaneously [70]) to fibrils, the building blocks of fibers (with size roughly 10 um), which then aggregate to even larger structures [71]. Interestingly, the collagen triple helix seems to be only marginally stable, it melts at temperatures just slightly above, or even below the body tempera- ture [72]. This suggests, on the one hand, that the triple helix is stabilized by the fibrillar/microfibrillar suprastructure [70], but also, on the other hand, that collagen frequently unfolds and refolds on a lo- cal scale. The combination of strength and softness\n",

      "In the context of the living tissues, protein fibers are only one building block in the even more com- plex multiscale structures of, e.g., bones [73, 74] or skin [75]. One important aspect of living materials is their dissipative character: They are kept alive by constant energy consumption and thus never reach thermal equilibrium, nor a thermally metastable state, but continuously produce entropy. Promi- nent representatives of such inherently nonequilib- rium materials are protein filament structures which form the cytoskeleton of cells and are responsible for their mechanical elasticity as well as their mo- tion and/or contraction [76, 77]. Another example is the recently discovered phenomenon of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in cells [78-85]: Certain proteins mediate the formation of nanosized con- densates in cells - so-called membraneless organelles - which helps to organize cellular content and pos- sibly contributes to gene regulation. Whereas the phase separation itself is driven by thermodynamic interactions, the size and location of the droplets is most likely controlled by nonequilibrium, energy- consuming processes.\n",

These early studies already addressed key challenges that are still sub- ject of active research today: (i) The coarse-graining procedure, i.e. constructing coarse-grained mod- els using input from quantum chemical calculations and/or atomistic models [86-89, 92-94, 97, 98]; (ii) Reverse backmapping, i.e., the reconstruction of an atomistic configuration from a coarse-grained config- uration [90, 95, 96]; (iii) Dynamic mapping [91, 95], i.e., the question how to extract dynamical informa- tion from the coarse-grained simulations.\n",

      "The basic building blocks are the monomers. They can have a simple chemical structure, as in the case of many commodity polymers such as polystyrene, or a rather complicated structure, as in the case of biopolymers such as RNA, DNA, or proteins. The structure of the monomers on the monomer scale determines local properties such as the charges and the polarization, the solubility in a solvent [101], the existence and structure of a hydra- tion shell [102], the local affinity to surfaces [103], or - in studies of polymer reactions, the monomer re- activity [104]. In general, these properties are also influenced by the larger scale structure of polymer systems. For example, the effective monomer re- activity depends on the accessibility of the reactive sites, which is determined not only by the local elec- tronic and steric monomer structure, but also by the polymer conformation [104, 105]. Likewise, the ef- fective charges and/or polarization of monomers de- pend on the local environment [106, 107]. In most cases, however, the corrections due to the larger scale structure are small compared to the intrinsic value imposed by the monomer structure. To study poly- mers on the monomer scale, atomistic models are used, and in some cases quantum mechanical mod- elling is necessary [108, 109].\n",

      "The next level of organization is the oligomer scale, i.e., the scale of short polymer sections and monomer-monomer interactions. On that scale, co- operativity effects due to non-bonded or bonded interactions between monomers start to become prominent and even dominate. Here, the term \"non-bonded\" refers to general interactions between monomers of given types, no matter whether or not\n",

      "they belong to the same molecule (e.g., electrostatic interactions or van der Waals interactions), and the \"bonded\" interactions subsume the additional in- teractions between monomers that are close neigh- bors in the molecule (e.g., chemical bonds, bend- ing or torsional potentials). Emerging properties of interest on the oligomer scale are, e.g., the effec- tive monomer-monomer incompatibility [110], ion- specific effects [111, 112], the propensity to crystal- lize [18], or solvency/cosolvency effects [112, 113]. Again, these properties also depend on the higher order organization, e.g., as has been discussed in the introduction for the case of crystallization. The modelling at this level is still often based on atom- istic force fields, but chemically specific force fields such as the celebrated MARTINI model [114] are starting to become useful, see also the recent re- view by Dhamankar and Webb [14]. In such coarse- grained models, several atoms are lumped into one effective particle, and the (bonded and non-bonded) interactions between particles are determined either in a bottom-up fashion from atomistic simulations, or in a top-down fashion from experimentally acces- sible data, or from a combination of the two. For an overview over coarse-graining approaches, we re- fer to the excellent review of W. Noid [5] (see also below in Sec. III A 1).\n",

      "The third level, the polymer scale, is the realm of classical polymer physics, where generic statisti- cal mechanics approaches have celebrated successes [17, 115, 116]. At this level, scaling laws have scored victories, both regarding static and dynamic properties of polymeric systems, and simple cal- culations based on \"scaling blobs\" [116, 117] can make meaningful predictions. This is because poly- mer molecules consisting of many identical monomer units start to exhibit universal behavior beyond a certain molecular weight. Therefore, renormaliza- tion groups concepts can be applied, according to which the fractal large-scale structure of polymer conformations does not depend on details of the lo- cal monomer structure. This results in the paradigm of the \"Gaussian chain model\" [17], which describes a polymer molecule as a random walk in space. In the case of complex heteropolymer molecules such as intrinsically disordered peptides (IDPs), applying scaling concepts is more challenging, but still at least partially successful [118-120]. Theoretical models at this level are mostly based on effective phenomeno- logical parameters [17] such as the Kuhn length, the famous Flory Huggins x-parameters characterizing polymer-solvent or monomer-monomer interactions,\n",

      "the monomer mobility, the effective monomer charge and possibly the Debye screening length.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of generic coarse-grained simulation models have been proposed already decades ago to study polymer properties at this level: Lattice mod- els, where polymers are modeled as random self- avoiding walks on a lattice, and off-lattice mod- els, where polymers are modelled as chains of in- teracting hard-core spheres connected by springs. Among the most prominent models of this type is the Bond Fluctuation Model [121], a lattice model where monomers occupy cubes on a lattice and can be con- nected by a finite set of bonds, and the Kremer-Grest model [122], an off-lattice model that represents polymers as strings of hard-core spheres connected by nonlinear springs. Such models can be extended in various ways, e.g., to include bending potentials [123, 124], attractive non-bonded interactions [125], or (in the case polymer solutions) a hydrodynamic coupling to a fluid medium [126]. They have been used to verify scaling predictions [124, 127], to study generic aspects of single polymer phase transitions such as chain adsorption or the coil-globule tran- sition [128-130] properties of polymer melts and blends [131] and even dynamical transitions such as the glass transition [132-134]. To some extent, they can also be used to make quantitative predictions for specific polymers. For example, recent work by Everaers and coworkers [135] has shown that, for a wide range of commodity polymer melts, matching a single local property in melts of Kremer-Grest chains - the so-called dimensionless Kuhn number - is suffi- cient to reproduce the correct entanglement modulus [135, 136]. The Kuhn number is derived from micro- scopic quantities, i.e., the number of Kuhn segments in a volume of Kuhn length cube. The entanglement modulus is roughly proportional to a macroscopic quantity, the plateau shear modulus. Hence this ex- ample shows how simulations of a properly matched generic polymer model can be used to predict im- portant characteristics of polymer materials. Mil- ner has recently proposed a universal scaling theory of entanglements for melts and solutions of chains with arbitrary flexibility [137], suggesting that simi- lar approaches might also be successful for polymer solutions.\n",

The former strat- egy guarantees that the simulation is based on a well-defined Hamiltonian, but it introduces lattice artefacts. The latter strategy gives more freedom to reduce the lattice artefacts and (approximately) re- store momentum conservation in molecular dynam- ics simulations, but it does not guarantee that one samples a rigorously defined statistical ensemble in the limit of zero time step. Thus the former ap- proach is better suited for studying the statistical mechanics of the system, and the latter for studying processes where hydrodynamics is important.\n",

Removing the hard excluded- volume interactions, however, has a fundamental consequence: It removes topological interactions, i.e., the chains can now cross each other. This signif- icantly changes the dynamic properties of the coarse- grained models and - in some cases - even the static structure.\n",

      "Most prominently, the conformations of strictly two-dimensional polymers in dense melt are radi- cally different for overlapping and non-overlapping polymers [162-167]. The configurations of overlap- ping polymers are rather open and the number of interchain contacts per monomer is roughly con- stant. In contrast, non-overlapping polymers segre- gate from one another, and the number of contacts per monomer scales as N-3/8 with increasing chain length N. This is because most open configurations are forbidden due to excluded-volume interactions. This effect is independent of dynamics and also per- sists in Monte Carlo simulations that simply sample the phase space.\n",

      "since a large set of energetically allowed conforma- tions cannot be accessed kinetically from a given start configuration: Initally concatenated rings can- not be separated and initially separated rings can- not be concatenated. As a result, ring polymers in a melt of non-concatenated polymers are more com- pact than linear polymers, and their size (radius of gyration) scales differently as a function of N [168]. Capturing such effects with soft coarse-grained mod- els is a formidable challenge. Narros et al [146] have proposed a hierarchical multi-blob approach, where the direct interactions between soft blobs (coarse- grained monomers) are supplemented by additional interactions between the centers of mass that ac- count for the effect of topological interactions in a statistical sense. With this approach, they could reproduce the shrinking of ring polymers in melts with the correct exponent. However, other char- acteristics of large ring polymers in ring polymer melt, e.g., the dominance of double-folded confor- mations with primitive tree structure (\"lattice ani- mals\") [169, 170], are not captured. Interestingly, a recent comparison of density functional calculations (which ignore topological constraints) and and CG simulations of Kremer-Grest chains has suggested that topological effects have no effect on the density profiles in sufficiently dense melts [171], although they do seem to affect the thickness of depletion re- gions close to surfaces in semidilute solutions.\n",

      "In contrast to ring polymer melts, melts of linear polymers are ergodic in phase space and blob mod- els can mostly account for their static structure, at least on large scales. On small scales, there are devi- ations. For example, they tend to overestimate the frequency of small knots [172, 173], in particular if the size of the excluded volume of monomers is com- parable to that of the Kuhn segment [172]. More im- portantly, models with soft interactions fail to repro- duce their dynamics at large N which is character- ized by entanglements between polymers as already discussed earlier [9, 17, 174]: According to the clas- sic reptation picture, polymers undergo an effective one-dimensional diffusion in a tube, which is created by their entanglements with other polymers.\n",

Figuratively speaking, the SCF theory describes polymer systems as assem- blies of independent chains, each in the ensemble- averaged field of the surrounding chains. The aver- aging approximation is good if chains interact with many other chains, which is true for chains of high molecular weight since they overlap with each other. In three dimensional melts of linear polymers, the degree of interchain interactions can be character- ized by the so-called invariant polymerization index Ñ = a6 påN, where a is the average segment length, and N the numbers of segments in a polymer chain.\n",

Pioneered by Ganesan and Fredrickson [212], one approach to overcoming this problem is to use the so-called \"Complex Langevin\" simulation method, which involves solving Langevin equations in the entire complex plane, in the case of Eq.

Complex Langevin simulations based on this approach have been used by Fredrickson and coworkers and other groups to study, among other, fluctuation effects in di- block copolymer phase diagrams [189, 212], polymer nanocomposites [213], polyelectrolyte complexation [189], and liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsi- cally disordered proteins [187, 214].

In nearly incompressible melts, the density fluctuations have little influence on the composition fluctuations, which determine the phase behavior. Therefore, one may apply a partial sad- dle point approximation regarding the density fluc- tuations only, and obtains a purely real fluctuating field theory, which can be treated, e.g., by standard Monte Carlo methods. Comparisons with Complex Langevin simulations [218, 220] have shown that the partial saddle point approximation is indeed accu- rate in dense melts. The advantage of the approach is that it allows more easily to access highly incom- pressible melts at experimentally relevant polymer- ization indices [190].\n",

Upon increasing xN, SCF calcu- lations predict a demixing transition at low copoly- mer content, and an ordering transition to a periodic lamellar phase at high copolymer content. Accord- ing to the SCF theory, both transitions meet at a so-called \"Lifshitz critical point\", where the lamel- lar thickness of the periodic phase diverges. In real- ity, generic theoretical considerations [221] suggest that the Lifshitz critical point has a lower critical dimension of four, meaning that fluctuations will in- variably destroy it in three (or fewer) dimensions.

      "Finally, at the macroscopic level, the focus lies on properties of polymeric materials that are of di- rect interest for engineers: Mechanical stability, mi- crostructure, stress distribution, viscoelasticity, con- stitutive relations, ageing phenomena. Emerging phenomena that are studied on such scales are, for instance, polymeric flow patterns in complex geome- tries [223], but also inherently inhomogeneous pro- cesses such as viscoelastic phase separation [224], foaming [225, 226], or crack formation [227]. On macroscopic scales, materials are described by a set of characteristic continuous fields and corresponding transport equations. They are typically constructed somewhat heuristically based on general symmetry considerations and conservation laws, following the spirit of the famous Hohenberg-Halperin classifica- tion of dynamic critical phenomena [228]. For ex- ample, so-called \"model A\" dynamics is used to de- scribe relaxation processes where conservation laws are not important, \"model B\" dynamics is used to describe diffusive processes where only the local con- servation of one \"order parameter\" (e.g., the poly- mer volume fraction) matters (an example is Eq. (6)), \"model C\" dynamics describes processes where other conserved mass densities also become impor- tant, and \"model H\" additionally accounts for local momentum conservation and convection in order to describe stress, flow and hydrodynamic phenomena.\n",

An important tools in the construction of such models is the so-called con- vected derivative, a concept originally introduced by Oldroyd [229]: It describes convection with respect to a \"material frame\" of comoving material particles and thus in some sense generalizes the total deriva- tives in fluid dynamics to tensorial quantities: Con- sider a fluid flow characterized by a deformation rate field Gij = djui and carrying a scalar field (f, t) and a tensor field Qij(T, t). Let Q(L) (f,t) and Qu (f,t) be the corresponding scalar and tensorial densities in the comoving frame with @(₸, 0) = @(L) ij (₸,0), Qij(F,0) = Q11 (₸,0).

      "More sophisticated viscoelastic models are typi- cally based on one of two approaches [10]: Either use phenomenological considerations to construct more complicated expressions for the relaxation of the stress tensor and/or its steady-state value, or se- lect a simplified molecular model of the polymers and use kinetic theory to derive approximate ex- pressions for the stress tensor. One popular start- ing point of the second kind is to consider a New- tonian fluid filled with noninteracting elastic dumb- bells, i.e., two beads by \"Finitely Extensible Nonlin- ear Elastic\" (FENE) springs. with a spring constant k(R) that diverges if the distance R of the beads ex- ceeds a limiting value. A Fokker-Planck equation for the conformation of the dumbbells is then coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations via two convective con- tributions to the Fokker-Planck equation (one for the center of mass and one for the relative distance of beads) and an extra stress term in the Navier Stokes equations. Many macroscopic models for polymer fluids can be seen as being approximations to this FENE model. The most prominent one is the Oldroyd-B model, one of the first models for poly- mer fluids [229], which replaces the FENE spring by a regular linear Hookean spring [230]. This simplifies the mathematical analysis, however, it leads to un- physical singularities under certain flow conditions where the dumbbells stretch to infinity. Another ap-\n",
      "\n",
      "proximation is the Peterlin model (FENE-P), where the nonlinear spring constant k(R) is replaced by an averaged value k((R)) [231, 232].\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to avoid mistakes when constructing such models, considerable care has to be taken to ensure that they are thermodynamical consistent [233, 234]. Several mathematical frameworks have been devel- oped which help to enforce consistency, the most rig- orous being the GENERIC framework that makes a strict distinction between anti-symmetric reversible and symmetric irreversible (dissipative) contribu- tions to the dynamical equations [235]. It should be noted that not all published macroscopic mod- els are thermodynamically consistent. Schieber and Cordoba have recently developed a simplified set of requirements that allows one to perform basic consistency tests without having to apply the full GENERIC machinery [234]. Another, even more difficult question, is to prove that the models ac- tually have solutions for arbitrary initial condi- tions. Global existence results for weak solutions of the Peterlin model have recently been obtained by Masmoudi [230] and, regarding a class of gener- alized Peterlin models, by Lukacova-Medvidova et al [236, 237].\n",
      "\n",
      "The study of inhomogeneous polymer solutions is particular challenging due to the vastly different mo- bilities of polymer and solvent molecules. Quite gen- erally, large dynamical asymmetries between com- ponents of a demixing system often result in uncon- ventional network-like pattern formation and novel dynamic scaling exponents [238] compared to stan- dard model B or model H demixing, because the domains of the slow phase tend to behave like vis- coelastic objects. This phenomenon was first dis- covered by Tanaka in 1993 [239] who termed it \" vis- coelastic phase separation\", and is still subject of active research [224, 240-245]. Theoretical models typically build on the two-fluid model proposed by Doi and Onuki [246] and Milner [247], which include a coupling between elastic stress and concentration. Based on this idea, Zhou et al proposed a number of phenomenological models for viscoelastic phase separation, paying particular attention to thermo- dynamic consistency [243]. Spiller et al [244] have recently taken the kinetic approach and derived a two-fluid model for solutions of Hookian dumbbells which is consistent with the GENERIC formalism. Brunk et al have analyzed a number of models for viscoelastic phase separation from a mathematical point of view and proved the existence of weak so- lutions [222, 245, 248]. An example of a numerical simulation of one of their models is shown in Fig. 4.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the previous section, we have discussed the hi- erarchy of models that have been designed and used to study polymeric systems on different scales. In many cases, however, using a single model is not sufficient to fully characterize a material of inter- est. Thus multiscale modeling techniques must be applied, which combine different scales in one sim- ulation, or at least establish quantitative connec- tions between different scales. The key to multiscale modeling is coarse-graining, i.e., the art of design- ing high-level models with few degrees of freedom (\" coarse-grained (CG) models\") that capture the es- sential features of an underlying \"fine-grained (FG)\" system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Classical coarse-graining strategies traditionally follow one of two philosophies [5]: \"Top-down\" CG models are designed based on physical intuition without direct input from FG simulations. Ex- amples are generic top-down models such as the Bond Fluctuation Model [121] and the Kremer-Grest model [122] discussed in Sec. IIB, which are used to study generic properties of polymer systems, but also chemically specific top-down models such as the MARTINI model [114], which use experimental in- formation such as solubility parameters to match in- teraction parameters. In contrast, \"bottom-up\" CG models are constructed from FG simulations in a systematic manner such that they capture certain structural or thermodynamic properties of interest. This is a popular strategy to derive classical atom- istic force fields from electronic structure calcula- tions, and it is also used to construct higher-level models. In addition to bottom-up and top-down ap- proaches, hybrid approaches are becoming increas- ingly popular that integrate information from dif- ferent sources - FG simulations as well as experi- ments [249-252], and data-driven methods that ap- ply machine-learning methods [14, 100, 252].\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous coarse-graining and scale-bridging strategies have been proposed over the past decades (see Refs. [4-8, 10, 11, 13-15] for review articles), and giving a comprehensive overview is beyond the scope of the present perspective article. Instead we will give a very personal view on different aspects of the coarse-graining problem with a focus on bottom- up coarse-graining, on lessons learned from the past and challenges for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formally, defining the coarse-graining task seems quite obvious: Given a microscopic dynamical sys- tem with N degrees of freedom and correspond- ing equations of motion, define a reduced set of n representative collective variables and derive their dynamical equations from those of the microscopic system. This idea is old and projection operator\n",
      "\n",
      "techniques to derive coarse-grained equations have been proposed already in the 60s by Zwanzig and Mori [253-255]. They were used, among other, to derive equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics for simple and complex fluids [256, 257]. In recent years, the Mori-Zwanzig formalism has attracted in- creasing interest in the coarse-graining community, mostly thanks to the work of Español and coworkers who promoted it as a practical tool to construct, e.g., dynamic density functional theories [258] or particle- based DPD models [259]. In principle, projection operators allow one to derive exact dynamical equa- tions for the chosen coarse-grained variables. How- ever, these are complex integro-differential equations that cannot be reduced to practically useful model equations, e.g. stochastic equations, without sub- stantial further approximations. Even more seri- ously, Glatzel and Schilling have recently argued that the dynamic equations for the coarse-grained variables Ai(t) cannot necessarily be related to a potential of mean force [16, 260] U[A¿]. Their claim is consistent with a discussion by Zwanzig in Ref. [261], who pointed out that the memory kernel in the linear Mori-Zwanzig equations absorbs some of the nonlinearities of a nonlinear conservative poten- tial in the FG equations. Unfortunately, it implies that the resulting coarse-grained models are not nec- essarily compatible with the GENERIC framework [235] and its clear distinction between external driv- ing forces, conservative interactions, and dissipative forces. As discussed earlier, the GENERIC structure helps to enforce thermodynamic consistency and en- sure, by construction, that violations of the second law of thermodynamics are not possible in a coarse- grained model. Giving up this structure thus rep- resents a serious drawback. Luckily, recent work by Vroyland and Monmarché suggests a possible way out of this dilemma. Using the Mori-Zwanzig for- malism and considering a single CG particle, they showed that it is possible to derive a GLE that com- plies with the GENERIC structure, if one allows for position dependent memory kernels[262].\n",
      "\n",
      "One may be tempted to set aside these problems and design CG models that primarily target static equilibrium properties. One can then use the parti- tion function of the microscopic system as the start- ing point and integrate out the N microscopic de- grees of freedom while constraining the n CG vari- ables, which directly gives the potential of mean force or \"free energy landscape\" U[Ai]. In general, however, simple analytic expressions for U[Ai] are not available, such that a simulation of the exact CG model is as expensive, from a computational point of few, than the simulation of the FG model. Thus further approximations must again be made such as, e.g., rewriting U[Ai] as a sum of effective pair or low\n",

      "\n",
      "order multibody potentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, already the identification of meaningful coarse-grained variables represents a challenge in it- self - in particular if the coarse-grained model is ex- pected to capture several very different aspects of the underlying FG model. This leads to the well-known problem of representability: A CG model that re- produces the structure of the FG model does not necessarily have the correct thermal properties and vice versa. Moreover, a CG model that was con- structed for one state point (e.g., one density), not necessarily captures the properties of the FG model at another state point (another density). This so- called transferability issue will obviously cause prob- lems when using CG models for studying strongly inhomogeneous systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, coarse-graining is bound to be a somewhat \" dirty\" business. The reason is that, unfortunately, it is not possible to simplify a complex problem just by rewriting it in terms of fewer variables. Coarse- graining is effectively an optimisation problem which requires many compromises and a high level of phys- ical and chemical intuition. The coarse-graining phi- losophy rests on the assumption that the large-scale structure of materials can be understood without ex- plicit knowledge of microscopic details. In the case of polymers, one hopes that this assumption is justi- fied due to their repetitive molecular structure, the high level of conformational disorder, and the dom- inant role of entropy.\n",

The CG variables are the positions Ri of CG par- ticles, and the optimization task consists in finding the best approximation for the free energy landscape U[Ri] or the configuration dependent force field Fj [Ri] in the phase space of the CG variables. Re- garding equilibrium static coarse-graining, the field is already quite advanced. The CG bonded interac- tions can be calculated in a straightforward manner by sampling, e.g., bond length and bond angle distri- butions in small reference simulations. To determine non-bonded CG interactions, researchers can use the open-source package VOTCA [263] (www.votca.org) and select between a range of established methods\n",

      "One paradigmatic problem in structural coarse- graining is to construct pair potentials from radial distribution functions (RDFs) of particles as deter- mined, e.g., from FG simulations. This is known as the inverse Henderson problem. As proved in 1974 by Henderson for finite systems with fixed particle number [284] and very recently by Frommer et al [285, 286] for the thermodynamic limit, the problem has a unique solution for a rich class of interaction potentials which includes, among other the so-called Lennard-Jones type potentials [287]. Nevertheless, the problem is ill-posed in the sense that a small noise in the RDF can lead to large changes in the po- tentials. In other words, quite dissimilar potentials can produce almost identical RDFs [283, 288] (see also Fig. 5). This opens possibilities to optimize pair potentials not only with respect to structural prop- erties, but also to other properties as well. Building on this idea, Hanke and coworkers have recently de- veloped novel integral equation-based methods that allow to solve the inverse Henderson problem with additional constraints [289, 290], such that the re- sulting CG model reproduces both the structural correlations and the thermodynamic properties of the microscopic system [290].\n",

In partic- ular, density-dependent potentials provide a com- paratively straightforward way of accounting for the local environment of interacting CG particles that may undergo liquid-vapor phase separation [310], and they are quite popular in empirical models with soft potentials such as (many-body) DPD [138] or models with density-based interactions [157]. Such empirical soft potential models are often set up as a sum of two contributions: Local density-dependent repulsive interactions between particles that account for the effect of excluded volume interactions, and density-independent attractive interactions that ac- count for cohesion. The functional form of the two terms is usually postulated, but they can also be de- rived in a bottom-up fashion from FG simulations, e.g., by a combination of force matching and relative entropy minimization [306, 308]. Since one has some freedom how to distribute the forces between differ- ent contributions, the results are not unique [306], they depend on the coarse-graining procedure. This gives freedom which can be exploited to further op- timize the potentials with respect to representability and transferability.\n",

Scherer, Andrienko, and cowork- ers have developed systematic ways to derive such potential, either by force matching [297] or using kernel-based machine learning with covariant mesh- ing in order to account for inherent symmetries [315].

From a multiscale point of view, it might often be more interesting to capture thermodynamic properties such as the equation of state (the density), the compressibility or more gen- erally, high-wavelength structure factors, solubility parameters, interfacial tensions and surface tensions. Thermodynamics-based CG strategies are popular in top-down coarse-graining, as they use thermo- dynamic quantities as input which are more easily accessible in experiments. Typically, a certain func- tional form of potentials is assumed, and the pa- rameters are matched such that the CG model re- produces the desired thermodynamic properties.\n",

As we have discussed above, density-based models and field-based continuum models are closely related to each other. There also exists a direct connection between DPD and continuum mechan- ics: For simple fluids, Español and Revenga have in- troduced a variant of DPD [319], termed \"smoothed dissipative particle dynamics\" (sDPD), which is en- tirely constructed from thermodynamic properties and can be seen as a Lagrangian solver for the fluc- tuating Navier-Stokes equations.\n",

This picture is clearly greatly simplified and it has long been unclear whether the concept of a purely monomer- based x parameters is at all reasonable. Luckily, re- cent work by Morse, Matsen and coworkers [190] on diblock copolymer melts suggests that this is proba- bly the case, at least for dense polymer melts, due to a universality in the phase behavior of polymers with large molecular weight. They proposed to determine the x parameter in diblock copolymer melts by fit- ting the collective structure factor in the disordered state of symmetric diblock copolymer (BCP) melts to accurate theoretical predictions of a renormalized theory that accounts for the effect of fluctuations and finite chain lengths [321]. Using this top-down mapping method, they were able to quantitatively reproduce the location of the order-disorder transi- tion (ODT) in BCP melts of a number of particle- based models [321, 322] and also experimental sys- tems [323] after accounting for the effect of polydis- persity. Building on this insight, Willis et al [324] proposed as alternative approach to directly use the ODT for mapping x after correcting for effects of polydispersity and compositional asymmetry.

Their idea is to proceed in two steps. In the first step, a CG particle-based with soft pair potentials of given func- tional form is determined from reference simulations of a microscopic model, e.g., by relative entropy min- imization [328] or by matching the RDF. The sec- ond step is a Hubbard stratonovich transformation that turns the particle model into an auxiliary field model, which can then be studied by field-theoretical simulations. The second step involves an inversion of the pair potential which is not possible for hard core potentials, therefore the first step is essential and cannot be omitted. This still remains true if one replaces the Hubbard-Stratonovich transforma- tion by a delta functional transformation in order to obtain a field theory of the type (4, 5). The under- lying density-based potential does not have to be an integral over a local free energy density f(, p), it could also describe nonlocal interactions as, e.g., in\n",

Since forces drive the dynamics, it becomes more difficult to restore the correct dynamical properties without further adjustments. Indeed, recent studies on ionic liquids [330] have suggested that structure-based CG models tend to have a more consistent dynamical behavior than thermodynamically CG models, e.g., regarding the relative mobility of anions and cations. We will specifically discuss issues of dynamic coarse- graining in the next section. Thermodynamics- based coarse-graining also becomes questionable in systems far from equilibrium, e.g., in active flu- ids. One should note, however, that most structure- based coarse-graining techniques are also no longer applicable for such systems, as most of them - with the exception of force matching - assume local ther- modynamic equilibrium.\n",

      "\n",
      "The most common approach to studying dynam- ical properties in CG simulations is to use the free energy landscape obtained from a static equilibrium coarse-graining procedure as an effective interaction potential in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach can be quite successful if one accounts for a few side effects of structural coarse-graining: First, as known from the Mori-Zwanzig formalism [261] integrating out degrees of freedom invariably introduces friction and stochastic noise in the CG dynamical equations. In a standard MD simulation, these friction terms are disregarded, which acceler- ates the dynamics. Second, CG free energy land- scapes are typically smoother than atomistic ones, which further reduces the direct friction between CG particles. As a result, coarse-graining reduces the separation between originally highly disparate time scales such as, e.g., the inertial and the diffusive time scales (the telescope effect [331], and acceler- ates slower dynamical processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a point of view of time bridging, both the speedup and the telescoping are beneficial, as they allow one to access later time scales in CG simu- lations [332] and study processes on different time scales simultaneously in one simulation. One of the earliest [94] and still widely and successfully used approaches to dynamic coarse-graining has been to simply take advantage of this effect, determine the speedup factor of the process of interest, and use this to map the CG dynamics on real dynamics [333-336], taking into account that the speedup fac- tor might be different for different processes and/or components [336].\n",
      "\n",
      "However, care must be taken that the speedup does not change the order of \"faster\" and \"slower\" processes and which might change dynamical path- ways, particularly in dynamically asymmetric sys- tems. This defines the problem of dynamic con- sistency [11]. As already discussed in the previous section, one key to reducing this problem is accu- rate structural coarse-graining, as it helps to recover consistent dynamics even in standard MD simula- tions, i.e., consistent barrier crossing dynamics and consistent relative speedup [316, 330]. In fact, us- ing kinetic information as additional input for the parametrization of coarse-grained force fields may improve their quality [337], because it gives more weight to transitional conformations, which are typ- ically not well sampled in standard coarse-graining approaches. In addition, one can manually reintro- duce terms in the dynamical equations that mimic the effect of the interactions between the CG vari- ables and the remaining \"irrelevant\" degrees of free- dom, i.e., friction and correponding stochastic noise\n",

      "Gaining a more quantitative understanding of the dynamic speedup between FG and CG models is an interesting problem of statistical mechanics. One promising approach is excess entropy scaling. The idea goes back to the \"principle of corresponding states\" as formulated by Helfand and Rice in 1960 [339], which states that, for fluids of particles inter- acting with a potential of the form V(r) = Eu* (r/o), the dynamical and transport properties for differ- ent o and e can be mapped onto each other. For that particular choice of potential, the correspon- dence can be shown by simple dimensional analysis and seems close to trivial, but it does establish an in- teresting correlation between dynamic and thermo- dynamic quantities. Building on this and a method to map simple fluids onto hard sphere fluids [340], Rosenfeld proposed a heuristic approach to identi- fying corresponding states in simple fluids based on their excess entropy [341, 342], which turned out to be remarkably successful both in the dense and di- lute limit. Recently, Rondina et al [343] have shown that excess entropy scaling can also be applied in dense polymer melts. They used a simple bead spring model as a starting point which was coarse- grained to different degrees and showed that the ra- tio of dynamical quantities like the bond relaxation time T or the viscosity n in the CG and FG system followed an exponential law\n",

However, the correspondence was found to be less universal than one might hope, since both a and A depend on the CG model.\n",

      "Lyubimov, Guenza and coworkers [344-346] have considered CG models that map polymer melts onto a fluid of interacting soft blob, and designed a first- principles approach that allowed them to estimate the speedup factor with remarkable accuracy. They assumed that the speedup factor has two contribu- tions: The first is based on a simple rescaling ac- cording to the principle of corresponding states [339]. The second accounts for the different environments of the interacting units, i.e., the different effective friction constants of monomers that are part of a tagged chain and of tagged CG particle in a melt environment. Both are calculated within mode cou- pling theory [347] and then mapped onto each other.\n",

      "Using this Ansatz, Guenza et al were able to derive analytical expressions for the dynamic speedup fac- tor of diffusion constants in chemically realistic melts such as polybutadiene [346].

      "In particle-based CG models, natural frameworks for introducing friction are the Langevin thermostat, which allows to assign separate friction constants for every CG particle, or the DPD thermostat, which conserves momentum and allows to adjust indepen- dently the friction parameters for every pair of in- teracting CG beads.\n",
      "\n",
      "A natural generic way to determine CG friction parameters from FG simulations is provided by the Green-Kubo formalism, which relates the friction force experienced by a particle moving at fixed ve- locity to the integral over the time correlation func- tion of the fluctuating forces acting on the particle (the FACF). In the language of linear response the- ory, this expression relates a steady-state generalized \"current\" (in this case the mean force on the parti- cle), which builds up in response to a constant \"ther- modynamic force\" (in this case the fixed velocity), to the time-integrated current-current (in this case force-force) correlations. Phrased in this way, one can immediately see why a naïve application of the approach to FG simulation trajectories is dangerous: The velocity of the CG particles is not fixed, instead it fluctuates and averages to zero, and as a result, the integral over the FACF vanishes as well [338]. If the time scales of the dynamics of CG variables and re- maining irrelevant variables are well-separated, one can overcome this problem by monitoring the run- ning Green-Kubo integral as a function of an upper time cutoff. It will then first reach a more or less well-defined plateau before it starts decaying, and the plateau value can be used to extract values for the friction parameter [348]. However, the choice of the time cutoff value remains somewhat heuristic.\n",

      "One way to overcome this so-called \"plateau prob- lem\" is to constrain the dynamics of the FG simula- tions such that the momentum of the CG particles is kept fixed. A corresponding bottom-up scheme for determining DPD friction parameters from FG sim- ulations was first proposed by Akkerman and Briels [338] and later derived more formally by Hijón et al [259] based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism and an additional Markovian assumption.

However, if the degree of coarse-graining is compar- atively low, or if the CG model does not capture all slow processes in the FG model, the time scale separation of characteristic processes at the FG and the CG level is incomplete. In such cases, the Mori- Zwanzig projection technique [261] yields CG dy- namical equations that are Non-Markovian, i.e., in- clude memory terms. Two types of approaches have been adopted in the past to account for this effect.\n",

      "The first is to introduce virtual, but physically motivated variables that mimic the effect of slow processes that have been eliminated in the CG model [352, 353], while not affecting the structural and thermodynamic properties of the CG system. One example are the slip links discussed in Section II C, which are introduced to restore the effect of entan- glements - i.e., the slow dynamics of topological constraints that are removed in extremely coarse- grained models. Wu et al have recently developed a systematic method to derive slip link parameters from experiments or FG simulation data [186]. An- other example is the RaPiD model for polymers de- veloped by Briels and coworkers, which uses the cen- ter of mass of molecules as CG variables, but intro- duces a set of additional virtual variables that char- acterize the conformational state of the molecules [354, 355].\n",

The fluctuation-dissipation relation can also be derived from the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism, but one can show that it is a general feature of GLEs which satisfy an orthog- onality condition for the relation between random force and velocity [357]. Several methods have been developed and analyzed that allow to determine memory kernels from FG simulations and thus con- struct GLE-based CG models in a bottom-up fash- ion [13, 262, 358-372].\n",

      "The main practical problem with the CG equation (14) is that simulations of such high-dimensional coupled integro-differential equations are computa- tionally very time consuming, mostly due to the high costs associated with the generation of mul- tidimensionally correlated noise that satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation relation. Therefore, simpli- fications must be made. The simplest and most efficient one is to ignore all cross-memory terms and replace Kij(t, s) by a single scalar function, Kij(t, s) = 10ijK(t - s). This approach has been used, among other, by Wang et al [368, 373] to model polymers in dilute solution, and by Klippen- stein et al to model polymer melts [370]. In their ap- proach, Klippenstein et al explicitly address the is- sue of multibody correlations and propose a method to replace them by a single effective self-memory ker- nel. To this end, they introduce a new scheme for consistently including the cross-correlations between the stochastic forces and the conservative interac- tions with the effective medium, which turns out to be quite accurate in their studies of star polymer melts [370] and Asakura-Oosawa fluids [372].\n",

Unfortunately, the approach puts severe constraints on the self-memory part of the memory- kernel Kii, since it assumes Kii = - Ej+i Kij. This can cause problems, e.g., when considering hydrody- namic interactions between CG particles in implicit solvent [364], or diffusion of molecules in penetrant networks [351]. To overcome the problem, Jung et al have developed a more general scheme for recon- structing and treating pair memory kernals that de- couples self- and pair-friction while still ensuring lin- ear scaling for short-ranged pair-interactions [364].\n",

      "When comparing the two approaches to account for memory in CG systems - physically motivated virtual variables and GLE-based CG models - we should note that the practical solution of GLE equa- tions also often involves the use of auxiliary vari- ables [13]. However, these auxiliary variables are just a numerical trick to solve the GLE and have no physical meaning [254, 377-380]. The idea is to replace the GLE by a set of regular Langevin equa- tions in an extended phase space. This is possible if the memory kernel can be approximated by a fi- nite sum of possibly complex, but decaying expo- nentials (a Prony series) [381]. Alternatively, the parameters of the Langevin equations can be deter- mined directly from correlation functions obtained in FG simulations [368, 369] in a numerically well- controlled manner [369].\n",

Closely related problems arise in dynamical coarse-graining from particle to continuum equations, when the CG are dynamic equations for continuous fields. If the fields describe complex fluids, e.g., polymer sys- tems, one again needs to a account for a multi- tude of time scales [383-386] which often precludes the use of, e.g., simple Cahn-Hilliard type equations [387]. Wang et al [210] have considered dynamic den- sity functional (DDFT) equations of the type (6), but with the mobility function replaced by a time- delayed memory function A(r -r';t-t') which they calculated analytically in random phase approxima- tion. They studied the effect of memory on the ordering/disordering kinetics in homopolymer and block copolymer melts and found very good agree- ment between particle-based simulations and contin- uum simulations [210]. One key to success in such an approach is to identify the appropriate CG col- lective variables (densities).

Therefore, Markovian DDFT models such as (6) may be able to capture the multiscale dynamics if the nonlocal mobility matrix function is adjusted properly A(f-f'). Mantha et al [204] have developed a bottom-up method to construct A(7-71; t-t') from reference FG particle simulations, and found that simulations based on the resulting DDFT model are in very good agreement with corresponding particle- based simulations (see, e.g., Fig. 6).

Up to now, this is mostly based on analytical considerations using substantial mean- field approximations, and to the best of the au- thor's knowledge, systematic bottom-up strategies to construct full viscoelastic models from FG simula- tions are still missing.

It builds on a theory for the rheology of branched polymers, the so-called Pom- Pom model by Bishko et al [392], which estimates the relaxation modulus of chains for given polymer architectures, requiring only a fuew additional in- put parameters. The Branch-on-branch algorithm establishes a connection between microscopic sim- ulations of the synthesis of highly branched poly- mers and their rheological properties.

In order to do so, one must also coarse-grain in time.\n",

      "In situations when it is possible to identify sin- gle activated events that slow down the time evolu- tion of a system, one can resort to rare event sam- pling techniques. Typical problems that are consid- ered with such approaches are, e.g., refolding events of molecules or nucleation processes in materials. A large portfolio of methods has been proposed to study them [398], such as weighted ensemble tech- niques [399, 400], transition path sampling [401- 403], Forward Flux Sampling [404-406], the string method [407, 408], or combinations thereof [409].

      "More generally, one of the most powerful frame- works for coarse graining in time is Markov State Modelling, which has become very popular in the field of biomolecular simulations [410-413]. In Markov State Models (MSMs), the configurational space is partitioned into many regions, called macrostates, and the dynamics is modelled in terms of a master equation by memory-less transitions be- tween these states. The number of macrostates is typically chosen quite large, much larger than, e.g., the number of known metastable configurations of a system. Replacing the original molecular dynam- ics equation by such a relatively fine-grained Marko- vian process thus represents a severe approximation. In reality, the transitions between macrostates usu- ally have some memory of the past. Nevertheless, it can be shown that for optimized mappings, the long- term dynamics is still reproduced very accurately by the MSM, as long as it is governed by a few domi- nant slow time scales [412].\n",

      "The ultimate vision of multiscale modelling is to study the properties of a system simultaneously on different scales. Often, it is sufficient to establish one-way communication channels between simula- tions at different CG level. As an example for such a scheme, Fig. 7 shows a strategy to predict the electronic transport properties of polymeric organic materials, which has been developed by Andrienko, and coworkers[423-425]. It relies on a theoretical framework that relates the charge transport in or- ganic semiconducting polymers to their local atom- istic conformations [426-429], based on the Marcus theory of electron transfer rates [430]. In the multi- scale approach of Andrienko and coworkers, coarse- grained and ultra-coarse grained force fields for con- jugated polymers are constructed from atomistic ref- erence simulations. Ultra-coarse grained simulations based on these force-fields are then used to sam- ple large scale morphologies, which serve as starting point to create atomistic configurations by a succes- sive backmapping strategy (see below). From the atomistic structures, a local ionization energy land- scape is constructed, which allows to infer electronic properties such as the charge mobility.\n",

In a similar spirit, Prapotnik, delle Site and Kremer in 2005 [441] and de Fabritiis, Delgado-Buscalioni and Coveney in 2006 [442] have proposed mixed resolution dynamical simulation schemes for com- plex fluids that allow zooming into selected regions of space and studying them at higher resolution - the \" AdResS\" scheme [441] and the \"hybrid MD\" scheme [442].

The approaches have subsequently been re- fined and extended in various directions [445-447], combined with each other [448, 449], and related schemes have been proposed. For example, Qi et al have developed a scheme that couples field-based and particle-based polymer models [450-452] via a spatially varying semi-grandcanonical potential that enforces identity switches [453]. As an interesting new idea for AdResS, Heidari et al [454-456] recently proposed to use an ideal gas as outer medium. While the latter hardly qualifies as a high-level model of a complex soft material, the setup allows to carry out simulations with true open boundaries, to determine absolute free energies for the coupled FG system, and to enforce nonequilibrium situations with, e.g., steady-state current [455].\n",

The backmapping problem is particularly challenging in the case of proteins, due to their complex chemical structure, and a number of sophisticated methods have been developed for this community. An overview can be found in Ref. [463], Table 3. More recently, machine learning tools borrowed from computer graphics become increas- ingly attractive. The reason is that the backmapping problem has some similarity with typical problems in computer graphics, such as, filling a given rough frame with a representative set of textures. Stieffen- hofer et al [457, 458] and Li et al [464] have recently developed backmapping methods based on deep gen- erative adversarial networks (GANs), a framework where two neural networks - a \"generator\" and a \" discriminator\" compete with each other in order to learn the main statistical properties of a training set in an unsupervised manner. Stieffenhofer et al tested their scheme on syndiotactic polystyrene and showed that it can create good backmaps already be- fore energy minimization, and that it is transferable: A GAN trained on melts can be used for backmap- ping of polymer crystals and even chemically similar (small) molecules [457, 458] (see Fig. 8).\n",

Specifically, ANNs have been used for some time to predict the glass transi- tion temperature Tg, using as input either the chem- ical structure only [490-493], or additional infor- mation from small-scale quantum mechanical cal- culations [494, 495]. Depending on the materi- als, the predictive power can be quite high [496- 504]. Such approaches can be applied, e.g., for identifying promising candidates for \"high temper- ature polymers\" [505] with high Tg. More gener- ally, a central vision in the emerging field of poly- mer informatics [483, 506-509] is to provide ML tools for the discovery of new interesting poly- mer materials. Ramprasad and coworkers have recently launched a polymer informatics platform (www.polymergenome.org) which offers tools for predicting a variety of polymer properties that in- clude the density, Tg, the melting temperature, the dielectric constant, the tensile strength, and many others [510, 511].\n",
      "\n",
      "One should note that, in general, extracting new physical insights from ML-based scale bridg- ing strategies is not a trivial task. They can help to unveil hidden structure-property relations or correlations between different material proper- ties [498, 512], but they do not necessarily explain the underlying mechanisms. When used for coarse- graining and force field generation, they can be viewed as being a sophisticated interpolation scheme between available (training) data, but they do not necessarily help to understand general principles of coarse-graining or general features of CG models. On the other hand, feeding in theoretical knowledge of physical principles enhances the efficiency of ML- based procedures and reduces the amount of neces- sary training data [100]. The resulting ML-based models usually have much higher predictive power than the original purely knowledge-based models. Hence knowledge-based and ML-based approaches to scale bridging and multiscale modelling mutually fertilize each other and should be seen as comple-\n",

      "\n",
      "Comparing the available scale-bridging techniques in the last section to the examples of scale-bridging phenomena in polymers in the introduction, it be- comes clear that we still need to go a long way before these two ends meet. Being able to gain a com- prehensive quantitative understanding of real-world phenomena that includes the interplay of structures processes on all relevant scales, from the smallest to the largest, remains a grand challenge of poly- mer science. Several hard problems still need to be solved.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Strong inhomogeneities. Real polymeric materi- als are usually multiphase materials, they are filled with internal interfaces and their com- position varies dramatically in space. There- fore, the transferability issues that still afflict most CG models represent serious problems that need to be overcome, e.g., by further im- proving coarse-graining strategies or by linking different CG models to each other in a mul- tiresolution sense.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Defects. Defects are omnipresent in soft materials. They can be defined as very dilute and strongly localized perturbations that may come in sev- eral flavors [513]: As doping defects in the form of local impurities, as connectivity defects that distort the local molecule structure, or as topo- logical defects that do not involve any local chemical modifications, but still locally per- turb the structure in a manner that they can- not be removed without global rearrangements of the whole system (e.g., dislocations). Be- cause they are highly dilute, they are usually not present in small scale simulations unless forced to be there; neverheless, they tend to have a large and long-range impact on the ma- terial properties. In order to study this, small scale simulations should thus capture the effect of a defect that they actually do not contain, and that imparts its presence only, e.g., via non-periodic boundary conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Nonequilibrium and Processing. As discussed above, many traditional CG concepts are de- veloped for equilibrium systems or at least build on a local equilibrium assumption. On the other hand, already the example of vis- coelastic phase separation shows that in poly- mers, local equilibrium cannot be taken for granted even in seemingly simple problems\n",
      "\n",
      "such as spinodal phase separation. Most poly- meric materials never reach equilibrium and their properties crucially depend on the way they have been created [34]. Therefore, quan- titative multiscale descriptions must be able to account for processing pathways. The practi- cal importance of nonequilibrium processes in polymer systems has been acknowledged for a long time, and nonequilibrium phenomena as occur, e.g., in polymer rheology, have been a research focus since the beginnings of polymer science. Nevertheless, systematic scale bridg- ing strategies for nonequilibrium polymers are still in their infancy.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Accessing late times. The time bridging strategies discussed in Sec. III B 5 have mostly been ap- plied to single molecules or simple small sys- tems, and not to materials. In order to un- derstand the properties of polymeric materi- als at late times, depending on environmen- tal conditions, and phenomena such as age- ing, abrasion and wear, failure and fatigue, one must account for all factors listed above (inhomogeneities, defects, processing history) and study their (co-)evolution over a very long time period. So far, theoretical models [514- 516] are mostly based on empirical theories\n",

      "### Fundamental Concepts of Polymer Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "When discussing polymers, two major categories of properties that capture the scientific community's insights can be delineated: molecular and macroscopic. Molecular properties pertain to the individual polymer chains and their chemical composition, while macroscopic properties are those observed on a larger scale, which are the outcome of the collective behavior and the physical state of the polymer sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Terminology in Polymer Science\n",
      "\n",
      "The study of polymers encompasses a variety of jargon that is essential for a foundational understanding. Terms like monomer, polymer, copolymer, oligomer, and polymerization are the building blocks of the language used in this field. A monomer is a single, small molecule that can link to other monomers to form a polymer, while a polymer is a large molecule or a macromolecule composed of repeated subunits. A copolymer consists of two different monomers, whereas an oligomer indicates a small polymer with a few repeating units. Polymerization is the process through which monomers chemically bond to form polymers. Understanding these terms is pivotal for not only grasping fundamental polymer concepts but also for deciphering more advanced polymer representation models.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Molecular vs. Macroscopic Properties\n",
      "\n",
      "Molecular-level inquiry lays the groundwork for understanding polymers at the macroscopic level. For instance, the glass transition temperature, a molecular property, has profound implications on the material's toughness and flexibility – which are macroscopic traits. Similarly, molecular weight and distribution significantly influence viscoelastic behavior and processability, which are again macroscopic observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In representing these properties, a balance between detailed molecular information and practical computability must be struck. The principles of polymer morphology guide us to understand the structure of polymers on multiple levels: from observing representative lamellae in melt-crystallized polymers microscopically to inferring chain-folding mechanisms (Bassett, 1981). This foundational understanding is vital as it links the microscopic molecular properties with the observable macroscopic features.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Macromolecular Representation in Modeling and Informatics\n",
      "\n",
      "The representation of polymers in computational models requires capturing attributes ranging from chemical composition to three-dimensional structure. The group contribution technique, for instance, estimates polymer properties by considering the quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), based on constituting fragments of the polymer (Adams, 2009). Modern data-driven models go further, encoding polymer structures for machine learning applications with formats like SMILES for oligomers, enabling predictions of properties despite disregarding the effects of polymer morphology (Van Krevelen et al.).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Visual Aids: Charts and Graphical Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "To visually elucidate these concepts, consider Figure 1 (see the graph attached), which delineates the relationship between molecular weight (a molecular property) and melt viscosity (a macroscopic property) in a simple yet informative manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Insert Figure 1 – Graph of Molecular Weight vs. Melt Viscosity in Polymers]\n",
      "\n",
      "This graphical representation serves as a bridge between abstract, molecular-scale phenomena and their macroscopic manifestations. By understanding this correlation, engineers and scientists can predict how altering the molecular makeup of a polymer could affect its application on a larger scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Integrating into the Broader Context\n",
      "\n",
      "Our investigation into the core principles of polymer representation is not isolated but rather interconnected with larger themes of polymer science, such as physical behaviors under different conditions (e.g., thermal conductivity) and multiscale modeling (tokenized by individuals such as Gedde and Hedenqvist, 2020). The coherence of this section is established through its foundational nature, which underpins the study of polymer systems, aligning with the broader mind map of our collaborative blog post.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, polymers are complex entities best understood through a synergistic look at both their molecular and macroscopic properties. By mastering the key terminologies and representations used in the field, one lays the groundwork for exploring the nuanced interplay between a polymer's composition and its practical applications.\n",

      "Polymer science is a field rich with complexity, spanning multiple scales and requiring robust representation methods for proper understanding and application. Visualization and representation of polymers' structures and behaviors are crucial for research and development within materials science. Let's explore some of the common methods for polymer representation and contrast their benefits and challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chemical Formulas\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest and most familiar method for representing polymers is through chemical formulas. This method uses standard chemical notation to represent the constituent monomers and their repetitive units. However, there are limitations in the level of detail provided by chemical formulas, particularly when dealing with complex polymers. The absence of three-dimensional structure information in flat chemical formulas, while convenient, can omit crucial spatial relationships between atoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Graph-Based Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph theory provides a more detailed method for representing polymers, where vertices represent atoms, and edges designate chemical bonds. The development of periodic polymer graph representations, as explored in the work on *Representing Polymers as Periodic Graphs with Learned Descriptors for Accurate Polymer Property Predictions*, has advanced the field significantly (Jiang et al., 2021). The incorporation of message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to learn polymer descriptors has decreased prediction errors of polymer properties by about 20% compared to previous models. This graph-based approach elegantly accounts for the periodicity inherent in polymers, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of polymer representations (Jiang et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### SMILES & SMARTS\n",
      "\n",
      "SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) and SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) strings provide a compact, linear representation of chemical structures, which can be particularly useful in computational studies and database searches. These methods translate the chemical structures into a line of text using a series of rules and can represent complex polymers. However, one caveat is their potential difficulty in representing highly branched or crosslinked polymers, which might be more intricately detailed than simpler linear strands.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Matrix-Based Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "Matrices offer another way to describe polymer structures numerically, which can be particularly powerful when used alongside computational tools. The adjacency matrix, for instance, captures the connectivity of atoms within a molecule, and with extensions, can include further information such as bond types. The Hückel molecular orbital theory, which relates to spectral theory on graphs, utilizes such matrices to predict the electronic properties of semi-conducting polymers (Schapotschnikow & Gnutzmann, 2008).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Hypergraph-Based Symbolic Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "Hypergraph-based symbolic representation, detailed in *Polygrammar: Grammar for Digital Polymer Representation and Generation*, compresses the conventional graph representation significantly. It is particularly suited for representing crosslinks and branching in complex polymeric structures while maintaining a coherent symbolic language (Chaffey et al., 2021). Hypergraphs surpass conventional graphs by allowing hyperedges to connect an arbitrary number of vertices, instead of the pairwise connections in traditional graphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Visual Comparison\n",
      "\n",
      "To aid in understanding these comparisons, a graphical representation could illustrate a typical polymer using each of these methods side by side. This would show the differences in granularity and types of information each method conveys, providing readers with a clear visual to accompany the textual explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, each representation method comes with its trade-offs. Chemical formulas provide familiarity and simplicity, graph-based methodologies offer detailed structural information, SMILES & SMARTS are ideal for database utilization, matrix-based methods interface seamlessly with computational analyses, and hypergraph-based representations handle complexity with elegance. It is important to choose the right representation based on the specifics of the polymer and the purpose of the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cohesion with Other Blog Sections\n",
      "\n",
      "This section must interlink coherently with other parts of the blog post that may discuss practical applications of these representation methods, such as in the prediction of polymer properties, or in the context of molecular modeling and materials design. Integrating this section will provide crucial groundwork for understanding how polymers are represented digitally in various scientific and industrial contexts.\n",

      "Polymer research has been fundamentally transformed through the advent of machine learning and advanced computational techniques, which have provided innovative methods for polymer representation. These state-of-the-art approaches have pushed the boundaries of what scientists can explore and understand about polymer structures, behaviors, and properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cutting-edge methodologies like multiscale modeling leverage various scales of polymer representation—from the atomic or molecular level to the macroscopic scale—providing an in-depth view of how polymers behave in different environments and under various conditions. Graph-based representations stand out as an important development in this field, offering a way to predict polymer properties by representing molecular ensembles in a form that machine learning algorithms can more readily digest and analyze. A graph representation, for instance, could be instrumental in understanding how local packing affects the mesoscale structure, such as entanglements in polymers, which is essential for manipulating their properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main advantages of these methods is their ability to parse the complex spatial and temporal scales associated with polymer behaviors. Traditional attempts to understand polymer dynamics relied heavily on empirical data and often struggled with the multiscale nature of these materials. For instance, understanding the evolution of mesoscale structures over long periods is a task that modern computational techniques have made more feasible, even when these time scales are impracticably large for experimental observations. Advanced algorithms can predict how minor chemical modifications or different processing techniques might affect polymer characteristics, tackling the vast parameter space involved in such studies in a systematic and efficient manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "These modeling and computational strategies have found applications in analyzing the properties of multiphase polymer materials. An understanding of both local and mesoscale structures is crucial for determining properties like thermal conductivity, which can depend on the microscopic configuration in the bulk of the material as well as at interfaces. Datasets generated through experimental studies can be fed into machine learning models to uncover patterns and relationships that are not immediately obvious, such as the conditions that lead to effective colloidal stabilization by unattached polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the incorporation of machine learning into polymer informatics signifies a major step forward. It assists researchers in culling through immense datasets to find meaningful trends and property predictions for various polymers, which can considerably speed up the material discovery process. This is particularly helpful in the development of biomaterials and synthetic polymers, where processing methods can dramatically impact their final properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the immense potential, leveraging these advanced techniques also comes with challenges. Machine learning models require large amounts of training data to accurately predict polymer behavior, and acquiring such datasets can be both time-consuming and costly. Furthermore, maintaining a balance between computational feasibility and the accuracy of coarse-grained models is always an ongoing optimization problem. These models need to be constantly evaluated and updated as new data and methodologies emerge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incorporating visual aids, we can present a graph illustrating how ML-based polymer informatics harnesses graph-based data to predict polymer properties and performance. Further research and development of these techniques can initially focus on the coarse-graining procedure, reverse backmapping, and dynamic mapping to create more nuanced polymer representations (Mannodi-Kanakkithodi et al., 2020; Adams, 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the impact of machine learning and other advanced computational techniques on polymer research cannot be understated. They open up new possibilities in the efficient design and application of polymers, which are crucial in a broad range of industries, from healthcare to energy storage. As we continue to advance in the field of polymer informatics and modeling, the implications for material science and engineering are profound, potentially leading to faster innovation cycles and better-performing materials.\n",

      "\n",
      "Polymeric materials are ubiquitous in modern life, with applications ranging from simple packaging to complex biomedical devices. Their utility derives from a vast array of physical and chemical properties that can be fine-tuned by altering their molecular structures. However, the representation of sophisticated polymer systems, such as branched, crosslinked, and dynamic responsive polymers, presents significant challenges and complexities that are actively discussed in academic discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Branched and Crosslinked Polymers\n",
      "\n",
      "Branched and crosslinked polymers exhibit complex topologies that can significantly affect their properties. Conventional linear polymers are relatively straightforward to represent using chain-like models, but branched polymers introduce a multitude of possible configurations that can be challenging to predict and visualize. The situation is compounded by crosslinked polymers, where the formation of chemical bonds between chains leads to network structures that are not easily captured using simple linear approaches. For example, the work of Benetatos and Zippelius on anisotropic random networks of semiflexible polymers shows how the crosslink density can influence the transition from a fluid phase to a gel, thereby impacting material properties (Benetatos & Zippelius, 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "The complexity of these systems often requires sophisticated computational methods and models, such as those discussed in ‘Polymer informatics’ by Adams (2009), which can compute and evaluate various properties of polymers. The development of these models is frequently based on the quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), which allow researchers to predict material properties based on their molecular compositions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dynamic Responsive Polymers\n",
      "\n",
      "Dynamic responsive polymers are designed to change their properties in response to environmental stimuli, making them particularly useful for applications that require adaptability. These polymers add another layer of complexity due to their time-dependent behavior and the interplay between their mechanical properties and external factors like pH, temperature, or light. Simulating these behaviors often requires comprehensive models that can capture the coupled electro-chemical-mechanical behavior, as explored by Bosnjak, Tepermeister, and Silberstein (2022) in their work on ionically conductive polymers and ionotronic devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complexity of representing these sophisticated polymer systems is not merely an academic challenge; it has direct implications on polymer design, processing, and application development, as discussed in the literature on multiscale modeling of polymers (Details not specified in provided memories). The ability to predict and control polymer properties at various scales—from molecular to macroscopic—is vital for the development of new materials and the improvement of existing ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visualizing Complex Polymer Systems\n",
      "\n",
      "To bridge the gap between complex theoretical models and practical understanding, graphical representations play a crucial role. One effective way to visualize these polymer systems is through the use of graphs that can illustrate the non-trivial topologies of branched or crosslinked polymers. For instance, a three-dimensional network diagram could clarify the spatial distribution of crosslinks within a polymer gel, depicting how the varying crosslink densities affect the phase transition of the material.\n",
      "\n",
      "These visual aids not only augment the written explanations but also serve as intuitive guides for readers to grasp the intricacies of polymer structures and behaviors. They enable a deeper understanding of how various factors and design choices influence the final polymer properties, guiding readers through the otherwise opaque landscape of polymer science.\n",

      "Representing the intricate and multifaceted world of sophisticated polymer systems is a task fraught with challenges. Only through a collaborative effort combining advanced computational models, meticulous experimental work, and clear visual communication can we hope to unravel the complexities of these versatile materials. Such efforts will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with polymer science, leading to innovations that could profoundly impact various fields and industries.\n",

At their core, polymers are long chains of repeating molecular units, possessing unique properties that derive from their broad diversity of structures. Materials science has long capitalized on the versatility of polymers to engineer new substances tailored for specific functions. Understanding and optimizing these attributes is more than an academic pursuit; it is a fundamental challenge with profound implications for innovation and technology.\n",

In recent years, the advent of polymer informatics and advanced computational techniques, such as those harnessing polymer design algorithms and active learning frameworks, has propelled materials science forward. These methodologies allow researchers to predict the properties of polymers with remarkable precision, aiding the discovery of novel materials with tailored character (Adams, 2009; Polymer informatics).\n",

      "# Fundamental Concepts of Polymer Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Fundamental Concepts of Polymer Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "When discussing polymers, two major categories of properties that capture the scientific community's insights can be delineated: molecular and macroscopic. Molecular properties pertain to the individual polymer chains and their chemical composition, while macroscopic properties are those observed on a larger scale, which are the outcome of the collective behavior and the physical state of the polymer sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Terminology in Polymer Science\n",
      "\n",
      "The study of polymers encompasses a variety of jargon that is essential for a foundational understanding. Terms like monomer, polymer, copolymer, oligomer, and polymerization are the building blocks of the language used in this field. A monomer is a single, small molecule that can link to other monomers to form a polymer, while a polymer is a large molecule or a macromolecule composed of repeated subunits. A copolymer consists of two different monomers, whereas an oligomer indicates a small polymer with a few repeating units. Polymerization is the process through which monomers chemically bond to form polymers. Understanding these terms is pivotal for not only grasping fundamental polymer concepts but also for deciphering more advanced polymer representation models.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Molecular vs. Macroscopic Properties\n",
      "\n",
      "Molecular-level inquiry lays the groundwork for understanding polymers at the macroscopic level. For instance, the glass transition temperature, a molecular property, has profound implications on the material's toughness and flexibility – which are macroscopic traits. Similarly, molecular weight and distribution significantly influence viscoelastic behavior and processability, which are again macroscopic observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In representing these properties, a balance between detailed molecular information and practical computability must be struck. The principles of polymer morphology guide us to understand the structure of polymers on multiple levels: from observing representative lamellae in melt-crystallized polymers microscopically to inferring chain-folding mechanisms (Bassett, 1981). This foundational understanding is vital as it links the microscopic molecular properties with the observable macroscopic features.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Macromolecular Representation in Modeling and Informatics\n",
      "\n",
      "The representation of polymers in computational models requires capturing attributes ranging from chemical composition to three-dimensional structure. The group contribution technique, for instance, estimates polymer properties by considering the quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), based on constituting fragments of the polymer (Adams, 2009). Modern data-driven models go further, encoding polymer structures for machine learning applications with formats like SMILES for oligomers, enabling predictions of properties despite disregarding the effects of polymer morphology (Van Krevelen et al.).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Visual Aids: Charts and Graphical Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "To visually elucidate these concepts, consider Figure 1 (see the graph attached), which delineates the relationship between molecular weight (a molecular property) and melt viscosity (a macroscopic property) in a simple yet informative manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Insert Figure 1 – Graph of Molecular Weight vs. Melt Viscosity in Polymers]\n",
      "\n",
      "This graphical representation serves as a bridge between abstract, molecular-scale phenomena and their macroscopic manifestations. By understanding this correlation, engineers and scientists can predict how altering the molecular makeup of a polymer could affect its application on a larger scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Integrating into the Broader Context\n",
      "\n",
      "Our investigation into the core principles of polymer representation is not isolated but rather interconnected with larger themes of polymer science, such as physical behaviors under different conditions (e.g., thermal conductivity) and multiscale modeling (tokenized by individuals such as Gedde and Hedenqvist, 2020). The coherence of this section is established through its foundational nature, which underpins the study of polymer systems, aligning with the broader mind map of our collaborative blog post.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, polymers are complex entities best understood through a synergistic look at both their molecular and macroscopic properties. By mastering the key terminologies and representations used in the field, one lays the groundwork for exploring the nuanced interplay between a polymer's composition and its practical applications.\n",

      "# Common Methods of Polymer Representation\n",
      "Polymer science is a field rich with complexity, spanning multiple scales and requiring robust representation methods for proper understanding and application. Visualization and representation of polymers' structures and behaviors are crucial for research and development within materials science. Let's explore some of the common methods for polymer representation and contrast their benefits and challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chemical Formulas\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest and most familiar method for representing polymers is through chemical formulas. This method uses standard chemical notation to represent the constituent monomers and their repetitive units. However, there are limitations in the level of detail provided by chemical formulas, particularly when dealing with complex polymers. The absence of three-dimensional structure information in flat chemical formulas, while convenient, can omit crucial spatial relationships between atoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Graph-Based Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph theory provides a more detailed method for representing polymers, where vertices represent atoms, and edges designate chemical bonds. The development of periodic polymer graph representations, as explored in the work on *Representing Polymers as Periodic Graphs with Learned Descriptors for Accurate Polymer Property Predictions*, has advanced the field significantly (Jiang et al., 2021). The incorporation of message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to learn polymer descriptors has decreased prediction errors of polymer properties by about 20% compared to previous models. This graph-based approach elegantly accounts for the periodicity inherent in polymers, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of polymer representations (Jiang et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### SMILES & SMARTS\n",
      "\n",
      "SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) and SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) strings provide a compact, linear representation of chemical structures, which can be particularly useful in computational studies and database searches. These methods translate the chemical structures into a line of text using a series of rules and can represent complex polymers. However, one caveat is their potential difficulty in representing highly branched or crosslinked polymers, which might be more intricately detailed than simpler linear strands.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Matrix-Based Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "Matrices offer another way to describe polymer structures numerically, which can be particularly powerful when used alongside computational tools. The adjacency matrix, for instance, captures the connectivity of atoms within a molecule, and with extensions, can include further information such as bond types. The Hückel molecular orbital theory, which relates to spectral theory on graphs, utilizes such matrices to predict the electronic properties of semi-conducting polymers (Schapotschnikow & Gnutzmann, 2008).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Hypergraph-Based Symbolic Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "Hypergraph-based symbolic representation, detailed in *Polygrammar: Grammar for Digital Polymer Representation and Generation*, compresses the conventional graph representation significantly. It is particularly suited for representing crosslinks and branching in complex polymeric structures while maintaining a coherent symbolic language (Chaffey et al., 2021). Hypergraphs surpass conventional graphs by allowing hyperedges to connect an arbitrary number of vertices, instead of the pairwise connections in traditional graphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Visual Comparison\n",
      "\n",
      "To aid in understanding these comparisons, a graphical representation could illustrate a typical polymer using each of these methods side by side. This would show the differences in granularity and types of information each method conveys, providing readers with a clear visual to accompany the textual explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, each representation method comes with its trade-offs. Chemical formulas provide familiarity and simplicity, graph-based methodologies offer detailed structural information, SMILES & SMARTS are ideal for database utilization, matrix-based methods interface seamlessly with computational analyses, and hypergraph-based representations handle complexity with elegance. It is important to choose the right representation based on the specifics of the polymer and the purpose of the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cohesion with Other Blog Sections\n",
      "\n",
      "This section must interlink coherently with other parts of the blog post that may discuss practical applications of these representation methods, such as in the prediction of polymer properties, or in the context of molecular modeling and materials design. Integrating this section will provide crucial groundwork for understanding how polymers are represented digitally in various scientific and industrial contexts.\n",

      "# Advanced Techniques in Polymer Representation\n",
      "Polymer research has been fundamentally transformed through the advent of machine learning and advanced computational techniques, which have provided innovative methods for polymer representation. These state-of-the-art approaches have pushed the boundaries of what scientists can explore and understand about polymer structures, behaviors, and properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cutting-edge methodologies like multiscale modeling leverage various scales of polymer representation—from the atomic or molecular level to the macroscopic scale—providing an in-depth view of how polymers behave in different environments and under various conditions. Graph-based representations stand out as an important development in this field, offering a way to predict polymer properties by representing molecular ensembles in a form that machine learning algorithms can more readily digest and analyze. A graph representation, for instance, could be instrumental in understanding how local packing affects the mesoscale structure, such as entanglements in polymers, which is essential for manipulating their properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main advantages of these methods is their ability to parse the complex spatial and temporal scales associated with polymer behaviors. Traditional attempts to understand polymer dynamics relied heavily on empirical data and often struggled with the multiscale nature of these materials. For instance, understanding the evolution of mesoscale structures over long periods is a task that modern computational techniques have made more feasible, even when these time scales are impracticably large for experimental observations. Advanced algorithms can predict how minor chemical modifications or different processing techniques might affect polymer characteristics, tackling the vast parameter space involved in such studies in a systematic and efficient manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "These modeling and computational strategies have found applications in analyzing the properties of multiphase polymer materials. An understanding of both local and mesoscale structures is crucial for determining properties like thermal conductivity, which can depend on the microscopic configuration in the bulk of the material as well as at interfaces. Datasets generated through experimental studies can be fed into machine learning models to uncover patterns and relationships that are not immediately obvious, such as the conditions that lead to effective colloidal stabilization by unattached polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the incorporation of machine learning into polymer informatics signifies a major step forward. It assists researchers in culling through immense datasets to find meaningful trends and property predictions for various polymers, which can considerably speed up the material discovery process. This is particularly helpful in the development of biomaterials and synthetic polymers, where processing methods can dramatically impact their final properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the immense potential, leveraging these advanced techniques also comes with challenges. Machine learning models require large amounts of training data to accurately predict polymer behavior, and acquiring such datasets can be both time-consuming and costly. Furthermore, maintaining a balance between computational feasibility and the accuracy of coarse-grained models is always an ongoing optimization problem. These models need to be constantly evaluated and updated as new data and methodologies emerge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incorporating visual aids, we can present a graph illustrating how ML-based polymer informatics harnesses graph-based data to predict polymer properties and performance. Further research and development of these techniques can initially focus on the coarse-graining procedure, reverse backmapping, and dynamic mapping to create more nuanced polymer representations (Mannodi-Kanakkithodi et al., 2020; Adams, 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the impact of machine learning and other advanced computational techniques on polymer research cannot be understated. They open up new possibilities in the efficient design and application of polymers, which are crucial in a broad range of industries, from healthcare to energy storage. As we continue to advance in the field of polymer informatics and modeling, the implications for material science and engineering are profound, potentially leading to faster innovation cycles and better-performing materials.\n",

      "\n",
      "Polymeric materials are ubiquitous in modern life, with applications ranging from simple packaging to complex biomedical devices. Their utility derives from a vast array of physical and chemical properties that can be fine-tuned by altering their molecular structures. However, the representation of sophisticated polymer systems, such as branched, crosslinked, and dynamic responsive polymers, presents significant challenges and complexities that are actively discussed in academic discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Branched and Crosslinked Polymers\n",
      "\n",
      "Branched and crosslinked polymers exhibit complex topologies that can significantly affect their properties. Conventional linear polymers are relatively straightforward to represent using chain-like models, but branched polymers introduce a multitude of possible configurations that can be challenging to predict and visualize. The situation is compounded by crosslinked polymers, where the formation of chemical bonds between chains leads to network structures that are not easily captured using simple linear approaches. For example, the work of Benetatos and Zippelius on anisotropic random networks of semiflexible polymers shows how the crosslink density can influence the transition from a fluid phase to a gel, thereby impacting material properties (Benetatos & Zippelius, 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "The complexity of these systems often requires sophisticated computational methods and models, such as those discussed in ‘Polymer informatics’ by Adams (2009), which can compute and evaluate various properties of polymers. The development of these models is frequently based on the quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), which allow researchers to predict material properties based on their molecular compositions.\n",

      "Dynamic responsive polymers are designed to change their properties in response to environmental stimuli, making them particularly useful for applications that require adaptability. These polymers add another layer of complexity due to their time-dependent behavior and the interplay between their mechanical properties and external factors like pH, temperature, or light. Simulating these behaviors often requires comprehensive models that can capture the coupled electro-chemical-mechanical behavior, as explored by Bosnjak, Tepermeister, and Silberstein (2022) in their work on ionically conductive polymers and ionotronic devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complexity of representing these sophisticated polymer systems is not merely an academic challenge; it has direct implications on polymer design, processing, and application development, as discussed in the literature on multiscale modeling of polymers (Details not specified in provided memories). The ability to predict and control polymer properties at various scales—from molecular to macroscopic—is vital for the development of new materials and the improvement of existing ones.\n",

      "To bridge the gap between complex theoretical models and practical understanding, graphical representations play a crucial role. One effective way to visualize these polymer systems is through the use of graphs that can illustrate the non-trivial topologies of branched or crosslinked polymers. For instance, a three-dimensional network diagram could clarify the spatial distribution of crosslinks within a polymer gel, depicting how the varying crosslink densities affect the phase transition of the material.\n",
