erties [2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Being of great industrial importance and playing a central role in biology and biophysics [8,9], they represent one relatively well-understood fundamental example of the vast realm of so-called "soft matter" sys- tems [10] comprising also, e.g., colloids [11], liquid crys- tals [1] and self-assembled surfactant systems [10].1 The notion "polymer" is not limited to the hydrocarbon macro- molecules of organic polymer chemistry à la H. Staudinger or W.H. Carothers [15,16] but refers also to biopolymers such as DNA or corn starch [10,8] and various self-assembled essentially linear chain-like supramolecular structures such as, e.g., actin filaments [9] or wormlike giant micelles formed by some surfactants [10, 17].

Obviously, dense polymeric systems are quite compli- cated, but since their large scale properties are dominated by the interactions of many polymers, each of these interac- tions should only have a small (both static and dynamical) effect. A sound theoretical starting point is thus to add up these small effects independently and to correct then self- consistently for the deviations due to correlations between the interactions [4].2 Obviously, the number of chains a ref- erence chain interacts with, and thus the success of such a mean-field approach, depends an the spatial dimension d of the problem considered. Let N be the number of monomeric repeat units per polymer chain (with N >> 100), RN ~ NV their typical size, px ~ N/Ry their self-density (also called

1 A soft matter system may be defined as a fluid in which large groups of the elementary molecules have been permanently or tran- siently connected together, e.g. by reversibly bridging oil droplets in water by telechelic polymers or similar systems of autoassociating polymers [12,13, 14], so that the permutation freedom of the liquid state is lost for the time window probed experimentally [10]. The thermal fluctuations which dominate the liquid state must thus coex- ist with constraints reminiscent of the solid state. Reflecting this solid state characteristics the dynamic shear-modulus u(t) thus often re- mains finite up to macroscopic times t and the associated shear viscos- ity n ~ fo dtu(t) may become huge. Most soft matter systems behave as liquids for very long times, i.e. u(t) -> 0 fort -> o and n remains finite.

2 As seen in Sec. 2, it is, e.g., necessary to "renormalize" [3] the local bond length l to the "effective bond length" b [4] or the second virial coefficient v2 of the monomers to the "effective bulk modulus" v [18] to take into account the coupling of a reference chain to the bath.

As notations we use r; for the position of a monomer i, L = ''i+1 -L, for its bond vector, I for the root-mean-squared bond vec- tor, Enm = Lm - Ln for the end-to-end vector of the subchain between the monomers n and m = n +s and r = Lnml for its length. Taking advantage of the translational invariance along long chain contours, subchain properties, such as the 2p-th moment of Enm, are generally sampled here by averaging over all possible pairs of monomers (n,m). The bond vectors between monomers are taken from a set of allowed lattice vectors.

For to leading order Gaussian chains (v = 1/2) this implies that typically p/ px ~ Nd/2-1 = \N >> 1 chains interact in d = 3. Hence, dense three-dimensional (3D) polymeric liq- uids should be much easier to understand than normal liq- uids, say benzene and let alone water, where each molecule has only a few, say ten, directly interacting neighbors [20].

## 1.2 Coarse-grained lattice models for polymer melts



Focusing on the generic statistical properties of flexible and neutral homopolymer melts in d = 3,3 one of the simplest idealizations consists, as illustrated in Fig. 1, in replacing the intricate chemical chain structure by self-avoiding walks on a periodic lattice [2,3,21]. Let us assume canonical ensem- ble statistics [22,23, 24,25,26,27] where the total monomer

3 Although we focus on 3D bulks the general d-dependence is often indicated since this may help to clarify the intrinsic structure of the re- lations. The reader is invited to replace d by d = 3. For similar reasons we often make explicit the inverse fractal dimension v. It should be replaced by its value v = 1/2.

number nmon = Vp, the volume V = La of the d-dimensional simulation box and the temperature T are imposed. (Boltz- mann's constant kg is set to unity throughout the paper.) A bond vector L = "i+1 - rj connecting the monomers i and i + 1 is not necessarily restricted to a step of length l = o (with o being the lattice constant) to the next-nearest lattice site. As in the well-known bond-fluctuation model (BFM) [28,29,30] presented in detail in Sec. 3, one may in gen- eral take bonds from a suitably chosen set of allowed lattice vectors to achieve a better representation of the continuum space symmetries of real polymers [1,31]. We focus on sys- tems of high monomer number density p ~ o-d. In princi- ple, although not in practice as seen below, one could sample the configuration space of such a lattice polymer melt using a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm [26,27] with local hopping move attempts to the 2d next-nearest neighbor sites on the lattice, as shown for the monomer k in panel (a). The specific local MC move illustrated is an example for the more gen- eral local and global rearrangements of the monomers [27, 29,32,33,34,35, 36,37] (respecting the set of allowed bond vectors) one may implement as discussed in Sec. 3.3. Due to their simplicity and computational efficiency, such coarse- grained lattice models have become valuable tools for the numerical verification of theoretical concepts and predic- tions [2,21,30], especially focusing on scaling properties in terms of the chain length N or the arc-length s = m - n ≤ N - 1 of subchains [3].

## 1.3 Flory's ideality hypothesis for polymer melts



One of the most central concepts of polymer physics is that in a polymer melt all long-range static and dynamical cor- relations are generally assumed to be negligible beyond the screening length § (defined properly in Sec. 2.3 and tested numerically in Sec. 4.4) characterizing the decay of the den- sity fluctuations [4]. The polymer chains are thus expected to adopt random-walk statistics as already stated by Flory in the 1940th [2,38,39] and worked out more systematically in terms of a perturbation theory by Edwards two decades later [4,40,41,42,43]. The (normalized) probability distribution G(r,s) of the end-to-end distance r of a subchain of a suffi- ciently large arc-length s should thus be a Gaussian,

(2)

G(r,s) = (27625) exp ( d 2

for ls > r > § and N > s >> g with b being the "effective bond length" and g the arc-length spanning the correlation length §. Note that in general the effective bond length b differs for various reasons from the root-mean-squared bond length / between monomers and ultimately must be fitted as will be shown in Sec. 5.3. One immediate consequence of Eq. (2) is of course that the second moment of G(r, s) must increase linearly,

R2={(Lm=n+s - Ln)2) = b2s for s >> g, (3)

and the same holds for the mean-squared total chain end- to-end distance Ry = ((EN -L'1)2) with s = N - 1 ~ N, i.e.

V = 1/2 for the inverse fractal dimension. Since the bond- bond correlation function P1(s) measures the curvature of the mean-squared subchain size R3,

P1(s) =

12 In . Lm=n+s) 212 ds2 ≈ 1 d2 TZR?

it follows from Eq. (3) that P1(s) = 0 for s >> g.4 This sug- gests to test for possible deviations from R2 ~ s by comput- ing directly the bond-bond correlation function PI (s) as we shall do in Sec. 5.4. That Eq. (4) holds follows from the gen- eral relation for displacement correlations Eq. (173) demon- strated in Appendix A.5

## 1.4 Rouse model hypothesis for polymer melts



Based on Flory's ideality hypothesis for the chain conforma- tions, the celebrated reptation model suggested by Edwards and de Gennes [3,4] provides a widely accepted theoretical description for the dynamical properties of entangled poly- mer melts explaining qualitatively the observed increase of the melt viscosity n with respect to the chain length and other related observables [45]. The central idea is that chains cannot cross each other and must due to this topological constraint "reptate" along an effective "primative path" set by their own contour.6 Using local topology conserving MC moves various authors have thus attempted in the past to ver- ify the reptation predictions by lattice MC models as the one sketched in Fig. 1 [50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57]. Similar tests have also been performed by means of molecular dynamics (MD) [24], Brownian dynamics (BD) [22] and MC simu- lations of various off-lattice bead-spring models [58,59,60, 61,62,63,64,65].7

4 This lack of memory of the bond orientations may be taken as the defining statement of Flory's ideality hypothesis. Using the central limit theorem [11] one immediately gets back to Eq. (2).

5 It is also common to define the bond-bond (or angular) correlation function as the first Legendre polynomial ₱ (s) = (ên · êm) using the normalized tangent vector ên = L/L,|. The difference between PI (s) and ₱ (s) is irrelevant from the scaling point of view and negligible quantitatively for all computational models we have studied. Higher or- der angular correlations may be described in terms of general Legendre polynomials ₱; [44] sampled as a function of the arc-length s between the bond pair or their spatial distance r. The polynomials ₱2i(r) may be used to characterize the interchain angular correlations, a question out of the scope of the present study.

6 In its original formulation the reptation model is a single chain mean-field theory, the constraints due to other chains being accounted for by the effective topological tube [4]. Due to density fluctuations generated by the motion of the chains and the finite compressibility of the elastic mesh, different chains must be coupled, however. As suggested by A.N. Semenov et al. [46,47], the relaxational dynamics of long reptating chains (N >> N3 in d = 3) is ultimately "activated", i.e. the longest relaxation time and the viscosity increase exponentially with chain length N and not as simple power laws [48,49].

7 The computational activities have focused recently on the latter off-lattice models, one essential advantage being that the experimen- tally relevant shear-stress correlation function u(t) can be computed directly without using additional input from theory.

We remind that reptational motion along the primative path is assumed to be the dominant relaxational process only for chains much longer than the (postulated) entanglement length Ne and for times t larger than the entanglement time Te ~ N2 [3]. In the opposite limit the dynamics is thought to be described by the Rouse model proposed in the 1950th, i.e. by a simple (position) Langevin equation for a single chain with all interactions from the bath being dumped into a friction term and random uncorrelated forces [3]. Thus the reptation model "sits on top" of the Rouse model and should the latter model prove not to be sufficient this must be rele- vant for long chains in the entangled regime.8

Interestingly, it is relatively easy to construct for the lat- tice models sketched in Fig. 1 local monomer moves switch- ing off the topological constraints without changing the ex- cluded volume and other interactions and conserving thus all static properties. This has allowed to demonstrate that topological constraints are paramount for the relaxation pro- cess [54,55]. Since the local MC hopping attempts corre- spond to the random white forces of the Rouse model and since all other long-range correlations of the bath are sup- posed to be negligible beyond §, one generally assumes that such a topology non-conserving lattice model should be de- scribed by the Rouse model for chain lengths N >> g. Since the forces acting on the chain center-of-mass (CM) IN(t) are uncorrelated, the probability distribution of the CM dis- placements must be a Gaussian just as Eq. (2) with the CM displacement [N(t) - LN(0) replacing r, the time t replacing the arc-length s and 2dDN replacing b2. The self-diffusion coefficient DN and the longest Rouse relaxation time IN of chains of length N should scale as [4]

DN~ b2W/N, TN ~ RN/DN ~ N2V+1 /W

(5)

with W being a convenient local monomer mobility defined properly in Sec. 6.3 [51]. In analogy to Eq. (3), DN may be obtained by fitting the mean-square displacement (MSD) of the chain CM

hN(t)=((IN(t)-[N(0))2)~2dDNt.

(6) The chain relaxation time IN corresponds to the motion of the CM over the typical chain size and may be defined by setting hN (t = TN) = R2 [51]. Note that Eq. (6) should hold for all times t (taken apart very short times corresponding to displacements of order of § or the lattice constant o) and not only for t >> TN as for reptating chains. In analogy to Eq. (4) one may characterize the CM displacements by a four-point correlation function in time, the "velocity correlation func- tion" (VCF)

8 As a consequence of the "hydrodynamic screening hypothesis" for dense polymer solutions [4], all Zimm-like long-range correlations are generally regarded to be negligible beyond the static screening length § [66,67,68]. The monomer momentum is not lost, of course, but trans- mitted to the bath and for large times and distances the melt is still described by the Navier-Stokes equation [1]. Although these hydrody- namic effects are beyond the scope of this paper focusing on lattice MC simulations, a short hint on scale-free corrections to the hydrodynamic screening hypothesis is given at the end of Sec. 7.2.

which measures directly the curvature of hN(t) with respect to time with u(t) = [N(t+ 8t) - LN(t) being the CM dis- placement for a time window St. Since in a MC algorithm there is no velocity in the sense of an Euler-Lagrange equa- tion, "velocity" refers to the displacement per time incre- ment St. As shown in Appendix A, Eq. (7) states that CN(t) becomes independent of St fort >> St. Since Eq. (6) implies that CN (t) must vanish for all times, this begs for a direct nu- merical test as will be discussed in Sec. 6. Interestingly, the above statements do not only hold for the displacement field of the total chain CM IN(t) but also for the displacements of the CM rs (t) of arbitrary subchains of arc-length s for times t << Ts ~ $2v+1 /W with Ts being the Rouse relaxation time of the subchain.9 We can thus state more generally that according to the Rouse model one expects Cs (t) = 0 fort << Ts and g Ks ≤N-1 (8) with Cs(t) being the VCF associated to the subchain CM displacements u(t) = rs(t+8t) - rs(t).

## 1.5 Aim of this study and key results



Summarizing recent theoretical and numerical work made by the Strasbourg polymer theory group but also by other authors [7,69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79], we address and question in this review the validity of the general screen- ing assumption for dense polymer solutions and melts both 1.6 Outline concerning Flory's ideality hypothesis for the chain confor- We begin this review by summarizing in Sec. 2 a few well- mations [80,81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89] and the Rouse modelnown theoretical concepts from polymer theory and outline

for g « s « N with p being the d-dimensional monomer density.10

At variance to Eq. (8) the displacement correlation func- tions CN(t) and Cs(t) of chains and subchains are observed not to vanish. Instead an algebraic long-time power-law tail

is found in d = 3 for all s ≤ N and t << Ts [90]. Due to Eq. (7) this finding implies for s = N - 1 that the CM MSD of chains hN(t) takes an additional algebraic contribution which dom- inates for short times such that

assumption for the dynamics of systems with irrelevant or switched off topology [90,91,92,93]. We argue that due to the overall incompressibility of the polymer melt both the static and the dynamical fluctuations of chains and subchains are coupled on scales beyond the screening length §. In d = 3 dimensions this leads to weak but measurable scale-free deviations which do not depend explicitly on the (low but finite) isothermal compressibility KT of the solution.

The static correlations are made manifest by the find- ing [80,84, 85, 86] that the intrachain bond-bond correlation does not vanish as implied by Flory's hypothesis, but rather decays analytically in d = 3 dimensions as

PI (s) = 3/2 Cp with cp = CooCs/8 for g << s << N (9)

the amplitude cp being given by the dimensionless stiffness coefficient Co. = (b/l)2 [4] and the so-called "swelling coef- ficient" Cs = \24/13 /pb3 [84]. Due to Eq. (4) this is con- sistent with a typical subchain size

R2 = b2s (1 -Cs/ Vs) for g < < < N, (10)

i.e. R2 /s approaches the asymptotic limit b2 monotonously from below and the chain conformations are thus weakly swollen as shown in Sec. 5.3.2. Note that generalizing Eq. (9) as demonstrated in Appendix B.4 the bond-bond correlation

the perturbation calculations which lead, e.g., to Eq. (9).

Since the predicted deviations Eq. (9) and Eq. (12) are rather small in d = 3 dimensions, the key challenge from the computational side is to obtain high precision data for well-equilibrated polymer melts containing sufficiently long chains to avoid chain end effects. This review focuses on numerical results obtained by means of the BFM algorithm with finite excluded volume interactions [86] and topology violating local and global Monte Carlo moves [84] as de- scribed in Sec. 3.12 Our numerical data for monodisperse melts are crosschecked [81,83, 87, 88] using systems of an- nealed size-distribution, so-called "equilibrium polymers" (EP) [17,102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111], where chains break and recombine constantly and for this reason the sampling becomes much faster than for monodisperse quenched chains (Sec. 3.5).

Static properties are discussed in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5. In the first section we investigate some thermodynamic properties

10 For d ≤ 2 the range of validity of Eq. (11) is further restricted as discussed in Sec. 7.2.1.

11 We emphasize that Eq. (11) and Eq. (12) are both scale-free and do not depend explicitly on the compressibility KT of the solution. Inter- estingly, both key findings depend on the subchain length s considered and not on the total chain size N as long as s # N.

12 To check for caveats due to our lattice model we have verified our results by MD simulation of a standard bead-spring model with and without topological constraints [80, 82, 84, 85,91,92, 93]. In order not to overburden the present summary, this story must be told elsewhere.

of dense BFM solutions such as the chemical potential UN in EP systems in Sec. 4.6 [88]. We verify in Sec. 4.4 the range of validity of the (static) "Random Phase Approximation" (RPA) [4] describing the coupling of the total density fluctu- ations, encoded by the total structure factor S(q) at wavevec- tor q, with the degrees of freedom of tagged chains, encoded by the intrachain coherent single chain form factor F (q) [5]. Section 5 contains the central part of our work related to conformational intrachain properties where we demonstrate Eq. (9). The deviations from Flory's ideality hypothesis are also of experimental relevance, as shown in Sec. 5.7, since the measured form factor F (q) should differ from the corre- sponding Gaussian chain form factor F0(q) as [82,83]

Our work on dynamical correlations in Rouse-like sys- tems without topological constraints [90,91] is summarized in Sec. 6. A simple perturbation theory argument leading to Eq. (12) will be given in Sec. 6.6. This argument uses the "dynamical Random Phase Approximation" (dRPA) [112, 113,91] describing the coupling of the degrees of freedom of the bath (encoded by the dynamical structure factor S(q,t)) to the degrees of freedom of a tagged test chain (encoded by the dynamical form factor F(q,t)). We shall verify explicitly this important relation.

We conclude the paper in Sec. 7 where we comment on related computational work focusing on dimensionality ef- fects (Sec. 7.2.1) [94,95,114,96], collective interchain cor- relations (Sec. 7.2.2) [18, 115] and long-range viscoelastic hydrodynamic interactions (Sec. 7.2.3) [92,93]. Several the- oretical issues are relegated to the Appendix.

## 2 Some theoretical considerations



## 2.1 Introduction



Let us go back to the simple generic lattice model sketched in Fig. 1. Simplifying further, we begin in Sec. 2.2 by switch- ing off all short- and long-range interactions between chains and monomers, the only remaining interaction being the con- nectivity of the monomers along the chain contours. Transla- tional invariance along these contours is assumed. No partic- ular meaning is attached to the orientation of the monomer index i.13 To make this toy model more interesting let us on the other side introduce two additional features: local chain rigidity (Sec. 2.2.1) and polydispersity (Sec. 2.2.2). Remind- ing some standard properties [3,4,5, 7,8] we will then intro- duce for later reference the intrachain single chain form fac- tor F(q) (Sec. 2.2.4) and the total monomer structure factor S(q) (Sec. 2.2.4). Since the chains do not interact we can

13 This implies i <> -i symmetry with respect to the monomer in- dex i which can be read as a time variable t as seen in Appendix A. Due to this reversibility the bond-bond correlation function can be ex- pressed in terms of the non-Gaussian "colored forces" [116] acting on the monomers, Eq. (176).

5

consider each chain independently. The interaction between chains and monomers will be switched on again in Sec. 2.3 by means of a Lagrange multiplier & limiting the density fluctuations (Sec. 2.3.2). Note that assuming Flory's ideality hypothesis most intrachain properties discussed in Sec. 2.2 should also hold rigorously in incompressible melts with the effective bond length b being the only fit parameter. The ef- fective entropic correlation hole forces for chains and sub- chains arising due to the incompressibility constraint are in- troduced in Sec. 2.3.4. The generic scaling of the deviations from Flory's ideality hypothesis is motivated in Sec. 2.3.6 before we turn to the systematic perturbation calculation in Sec. 2.4. Following Muthukumar and Edwards [43] we ar- gue that the reference length b0 of the Gaussian reference chain of the calculation (Sec. B.2) should be renormalized (Sec. 2.4.5). The bond-bond correlation function P1(s) for asymptotically long chains is presented in Sec. 2.4.6 before we turn finally in Sec. 2.4.7 to finite chain size effects.

## 2.2 Connectivity constraint



## 2.2.1 Local rigidity



Keeping only the chain connectivity we switch off all other monomer and chain interactions. Let us apply a local stiff- ness energy proportional to the cosine of the bond angle 0, cos(0)= ên · ên+1, with en = Ln/L| being the unit tangent vector. The stiffness energy is assumed to be not too large to avoid lattice artifacts [52]. Due to the multiplicative loss of any information transferred recursively along the chain con- tour the bond-bond correlation function P1 (s) must decay exponentially with arc-length s [2],

## Pı(s) ~ exp(-s/sp)



(15) with sp = lp/l being the curvilinear persistence length, i.e. Pı(s) ~ 0 for s >> Sp. Using Eq. (4) it follows of course that R2 ~ b2s for subchains of arc-length s >> Sp. Assum- ing Eq. (15) this implies b2 = 12(2sp - 1) for the effective bond length b since more generally it is known that [29]

00 s=0

b2 = 12 | 2 X P1 (s) - 1 ) = 211 -12. (16)

The latter relation is consistent with the more common defi- nition [4]14

b2 = 2da2 = Cool2 = lim (17) R N 2 N-> N using the total chain mean-squared end-to-end distance [4]. We have introduced here a convenient monomeric length a allowing to simplify prefactors depending in a spurious man- ner on the spatial dimension d and have reminded the dimen- sionless stiffness parameter Co. = (b/l)2.

14 Definitions based on such "Einstein relations" [117] are generally more robust numerically.

6

We note that a good approximation for a "freely rotating chain" with local stiffness potential is given by [4]

Coo = 1-(cos(0)) 1 + (cos(e)> ≥1,

(18)

which has been shown to be useful even for lattice models with discrete bond angles [52]. In summary, a local stiffness energy does not change the scaling of the chain and sub- chain size with, respectively, N or s, but merely increases its amplitude. Note that a weak local chain stiffness with Sp ~ 1 would be generated by disallowing chains to return after, say, two steps to the same lattice site (so-called "non- reversal random walks" [25]) and similar local constraints. Since these are the only local stiffness contributions which may occur in the presented numerical work these small rigid- ity effects can be safely disregarded below.15

## 2.2.2 Polydispersity



Let us relax the monodispersity constraint made above and assume a general (normalized) probability distribution PN for chains of length N. We suppose that the mean chain length (N) is arbitrarily large and that all moments (NP) = Jo dN NP PN of the distribution exist. For subchain proper- ties everything remains as before. Let us call R2 the typical mean-squared chain size of chains of length N. Since one averages experimentally over chains of different length this total average depends now on the moment p of the distribu- tion which is probed,

R (NP) (RUNPY 62 (NP+1) 2

(19) with Np being the p-averaged chain length. Since for exper- imentally reasonable distributions (NP) ~ (N)P ~ NPP, we have normally R2 ~ b2 (N) with numerical coefficients due to the moment taken. For the properties considered by us, it is the so-called "z-average" for p = 2 which matters most. The z-average is for instance probed by sedimentation in an analytical ultracentrifuge or in neutron scattering measure- ments of the intramolecular form factor F (q) as further dis- cussed in Sec. 2.2.4 [5]. Note that all standard definitions and formulas [3,4] are recovered for a monodisperse length distribution PN = 8(N' - N).

(NP)

For the important case of Flory-distributed polymers with PN = u exp(-uN) with (N) = u-1 (20) we have (NP) = p! (N)P and thus R? = (p+1)b2 (N). Such a Flory distribution is expected for systems of EP with an annealed length distribution where a constant finite scission energy E ≥ 0 has to be paid for the scission of each bond as described in Sec. 3.5. This can be seen by minimizing the Flory-Huggins free energy functional [9, 17, 107]

F[pN] = V ΣΏΝ (Tlog(pN) + μΝ +E+δμΝ)

(21)

All contributions to the chemical potential of the chain UN which are linear in N can be absorbed within this Lagrange multiplier. The scission energy E characterizes the imposed enthalpic free energy cost for breaking a chain bond. The last term 8 UN encodes the remaining non-linear contribution to the chemical potential UN which has to be paid for creating two new chain ends.16 For non-interacting random walks on the lattice this contribution is just a (model depending) con- stant entropic factor which renormalizes the imposed scis- sion energy to an N-independent effective scission free en- ergy E + δμη [109]. The minimization of Eq. (21) under the density constraint, Eq. (22), yields Eq. (20) with a mean chain length

u-1 = (N) = ((NP) / p!) 1/P~ pexp(E/T) as the reader will readily verify.

2.2.3 Segmental size-distribution G(r,s)

Due to the translational invariance in space and along the chain contours most perturbation calculations outlined be- low [83,84,87,88] are more readily performed in recipro- cal space. The Fourier transform of a function f(r) is de- noted f(q) = F[f(r)] = J drf (r)e-19- and we write f(t) = L[f(s)] = Jo f(s)e-st for the Laplace transform of a func- tion f(s) with t being the Laplace variable conjugated to the arc-length s. We have introduced in Sec. 1.3 the prob- ability distribution G(r,s) of the end-to-end distance r of a subchain of arc-length s between the monomers n and m = n +s of a chain. The Fourier transform of this two-point in- tramolecular correlation function is thus in general G(q,s) = (exp(-iq · r)> with the average being taken over all possible subchain vectors r = rm - Ln. For (infinite) Gaussian chains this becomes [4]

G(q,s) =Go(q,s) = exp(-(aq)2s). (24) The index 0 has been introduced for the general case where G(q,s) may differ from the Gaussian propagator G0(q,s) used in our perturbation calculations. Moments of the distri- bution G(r,s) are readily obtained from derivatives of G(q,s) taken at q = 0 as recalled in Appendix B.1 [116]. It follows for instance for the 2p-th moment of the distribution that

(2) = (-1)"A"Go(q,s) |q=0 p! (2p+1)! (2d)₽ 6₽ spa2P (25)

for Gaussian chains. We have thus

Kp(s) =1- p!6₽ <12p> =0. (26)

(2p+1)! (b2s)p

16 As shown in Sec. 4.6 and Sec. B.6, the free energy contribution δμη may depend in general on the chain length N [6, 7, 106].

A very closely related characterization of G(r,s) is given by the standard non-Gaussianity parameter

Cp(s)=1- p!6P < P2p)

(27)

(2p +1)! (+2)P

which for Gaussian chains is identical to Kp(s). As further discussed in Sec. 5.5, &p(s) has computationally the advan- tage that the effective bond length b must not be known a priori. Obviously, the general distribution G(r,s) is fully determined by either the dimensionless moments Kp(s) or ap(s) [116].

In Fourier-Laplace space the Gaussian propagator reads

1 (aq)2+t

Go(q,t) =

.

(28)

If one needs to average over all bond pairs at a given dis- tance r irrespective of their curvilinear distance s, and one has thus to sum over all possible s as in Sec. B.5, this cor- responds (for arbitrarily large chains) to setting t = 0 for the corresponding Laplace variable. The summed up Gaussian propagator for infinite chains is thus Go(q,t = 0) = (aq)-2. For Flory-distributed Gaussian chains of finite mean chain length (N) = 1/u we have more generally a summed up Gaussian propagator

(31)

for infinite objects of inverse fractal dimension v [3, 10].17 This power-law dependence of the local density means that our random-walk polymer is a fractal set in the sense of Mandelbrot [19], i.e. the average mass (number of mono- mers) within a distance r of an arbitrary point of the set varies as a power of r. The r-dependence of the local den- sity reflects a type of spatial order that is not connected to translation or rotation symmetries but to the "dilation trans- formation" to a magnified system [3]. A structureless, uni- form material looks the same when magnified, provided the magnification is too weak to see the molecular constituents ("lower cutoff"). The scaling exponent d - 1/v characterizes the dilation symmetry in the same way that linear momen- tum characterizes translational symmetry and angular mo- mentum characterizes rotational symmetry [10].

17 The reader may verify the indicated scaling by direct integration of Eq. (2) with respect to s for monodisperse chains with N -> 00.

## 2.2.4 Intramolecular coherent form factor F (q)



The two-point correlation function G(q,s) may be probed experimentally through the intramolecular form factor F (q) which for monodisperse chains is defined by [4]

F(q) = 1 N

(32)

n,m=1

=

(33)

with C = EN= cos(q. rn) and S = En=1 sin(q . rn). The sec- ond representation being an operation linear in N has ob- vious computational advantages for large chain lengths. In principle, the characteristic polymer size may be obtained experimentally from F(q) in the Guinier regime for small q [5]. Expanding Eq. (32) yields F(q) = N(1-(Rg(N)q)2/d) with Rg (N) being the gyration radius defined as

N E (In-rm)2).

R2(N) = 2N2 n,m=1

(34)

For chains following Gaussian statistics (as our lattice chains with switched off interactions) where R2 = ((En - Lm)2) = b2s, it follows by integration of Eq. (34) that R2 (N) = R2/6 = da2N/3. For large wavevectors where the internal fractal chain structure is probed, the form factor decays as

F(q) = 2 ~ Nº for qRg >> 1

(35)

as sketched by the thin line in Fig. 2.18 More generally, the form factor of monodisperse Gaussian chains is given by F(q) = NfD(x) with x = (qRg(N))2 and the Debye function

f (x) = (exp(-x)- 1+x).

(36) S(q) = 1

For convenience of calculation, the Debye function is often replaced by the Padé approximation

F(q)~ N 1+(qRg)2/2 ~(aq)2+2/N 2

(37) with q being a wavevector commensurate with the simula- tion box19 and the thermal average ( ... ) being performed over all configurations of the ensemble and all possible wave- vectors of length q = |q|. Since we have switched off all monomer interactions, monomers on different chains are un- correlated and, hence,

where the last step holds for d = 3.

For a general mass distribution pN the form factor is de- fined as [5,6,83]

F( ) = IN E PN N=0 n,m=1 2 (exp (-iq. (Ln -L'm))) .

00 N

(38) 1

In practice, Eq. (38) corresponds to the computation of the averaged sum over contributions (C2 + S2) for each chain which one divides finally by the total number nmon of labeled monomers [83]. In the small-q regime one obtains again a Guinier relation

F(g) ~ [N] (1 (Rg,za)2)

for Rg,z q << 1 (39)

where Rg,z stands now for the z-averaged gyration radius [6] where the moment p = 2 is taken over the standard radius of gyration R2(N), Eq. (34). Note that for Flory-distributed Gaussian chains we have Roz = da2 / u and the form factor becomes [83]

2

F(q)=

. (aq)2 + u

(40)

Eq. (40) reduces to Eq. (35) for large wavevectors, as one expects, since in this limit F (q) must become independent of the length distribution pN. Note that Eq. (40) has the same form as the Padé approximation for monodisperse chains, Eq. (37).

## 2.2.5 Total monomer structure factor S(q)



For non-interacting chains the local monomer density can freely fluctuate being restricted only by the chain connec- tivity. The isothermal compressibility KT [1] is thus given by the osmotic contribution due to the density of chains, i.e. TKT= 1/(p/(N)) diverges linearly with the typical chain

18 The power-law scaling is obtained directly by Fourier transforma- tion of Eq. (31) which yields F(q) ~ 1/q1/v. This scaling only holds if the fractal object is "open", i.e. d > 1/v, and the scattering intensity is not dominated by the Porod scattering at the (possibly fractal) "sur- face" of a compact object [5, 118]. The latter Porod scattering becomes relevant, e.g., for self-avoiding polymers in strictly d = 2 dimensions [119, 120] and for non-olympic and un-knotted rings in d = 3 or thin films of finite width (d = 2+) [121, 122, 118]. In both cases the poly- mers adopt compact configurations, 1/v = d, with a fractal surface of well-defined fractal surface exponent ds ≤ d. The form factor thus de- cays as F(q)/N~ 1/(RNq)2d-ds [118].

as indicated for monodisperse chains by the thin line in Fig. 2. Due to the chain connectivity the fluctuations of chains (mea- sured by KT) and the fluctuations of monomers (measured by S(q)) may differ for polydisperse non-interacting systems: While S(q) -> <N2) / (N) in the small-q limit as seen from Eq. (39), we have T KTp = (N) for the compressibility.20

## 2.3 Incompressibility constraint



## 2.3.1 Dimensionless compressibility g



Obviously, dense polymer solutions and melts are essentially incompressible, i.e. KT -> 0, and the above assumption that the total density can freely fluctuate is not very realistic. It is useful to introduce here a central dimensionless thermo- dynamic property characterizing the degree of density fluc- tuations on large scales, the so-called "dimensionless com- pressibility" [83,84,86]

1

g = lim (TKTp) = lim

vp

(N) ->00 (N) >>> >0 lim S(q) ) . (43)

At standard experimental polymer melt conditions g remains of course finite, say g ~ 0.1, but typically well below unity as indicated by the bold dashed line in Fig. 2 [8]. Note that we have defined g in the limit of asymptotically long chains to take off the trivial compressibility contribution due to the translational invariance of the chains mentioned above. For later reference we have also introduced in Eq. (43) the effec- tive "bulk modulus" v [115]. As indicated, the dimensionless compressibility can be determined directly in experiments or in a computer simulation from the low-q limit of the total monomer structure factor S(q). This point is further elabo- rated in Sec. 4.4.

19 If we use a cubic simulation box of linear dimension L the smallest possible wavevector is 21/L.

20 The dimensionless compressibility g defined in Eq. (43) for asymptotically long chains does not depend on this ideal chain contri- bution. Care is needed, however, if g is determined numerically from S(q) for polydisperse systems of finite (N2) / (N) by extrapolation in analogy to the monodisperse case discussed in Sec. 4.4.

## 2.3.2 Lagrange multiplier ¿



Physically, the incompressibility of dense polymer systems arises of course due to the short-range repulsion of the mono- mers, i.e. it depends on non-universal physical and chemi- cal properties. From the theoretical and computational point of view it is, however, inessential how the incompressibil- ity at low wavevectors is imposed.21 This constraint could be achieved, at least in principle, by "simple sampling" [26] of only those configurations respecting the chosen g. In this sense it is thus the "throwing away" of configurations from the extended configuration ensemble containing all possible linear chain paths on the lattice which creates the repulsive forces between chains, subchains and monomers.22 Alterna- tively, one may design intricate local and global MC moves forcing the system through configuration space along a hy- perplane of constant g [27,29].

A more general and computationally more natural route is to use an extended ensemble [26] and to impose the in- compressibility constraint through an external field with a Lagrange multiplier & conjugated to the local monomer den- sity fluctuations. As may be seen in more detail in Sec. 3.4 for a specific lattice model, this implies in practice that one has to pay an energy of order & for the overlap of two mono- mers. While in the low-E limit with g(¿) >> (N) the chains do not interact, i.e. S(q) = F (q) for all q, the incompressibil- ity constraint S(q) ~ g(¿ = 0) << 1 holds for all wavevectors q up to the monomeric scale (q ~1/0) in the opposite limit ¿ - > o. This is shown by the bold dashed line in Fig. 2.

## 2.3.3 Thermal blobs of size §



The situation is slightly more complicated for intermediate overlap penalties ¿ with 1 « g(¿) « (N) indicated by the thin dashed line. Since g(E) is now a well-defined character- istic chain length in curvilinear space along the chain con- tour, it corresponds to a characteristic scale in real space, the "screening length" § (¿) of the density fluctuations defined as [4]

1 2 52 = 02g = 2vp

(44)

where we use the effective bulk modulus v = 1/(gp) follow- ing Eq. (43).23 Generalizing Eq. (42) to systems with finite

21 If the goal is to map a computational model onto a real polymer melt aiming to understand macroscopic properties, the starting point should be, in our opinion, to match the mechanical and thermodynamic properties in the low-q limit, e.g. the dimensionless compressibility g, rather than to fiddle with S(q) on the monomer scale.

22 The scale-free correlations described in this paper are thus akin to the effective "anti-Casimir forces" which arise in dense polymer melts due to the throwing away of configurations containing closed loops from an extended configuration ensemble with both linear chains and rings [18, 115].

23 From the scaling point of view a curvilinear length s >> 1 translates quite generally to a spatial distance r » o and a wavevector q << 1/0 according to r ~ 1/q ~ s' with v being the inverse fractal dimension.

using Eq. (35) in the second step. The Ornstein-Zernike cor- relation equation [11] Eq. (46) justifies the above definition of the "screening length" §, i.e. density fluctuations decay in d = 3 exponentially as [4]

(p(r)p(0)) - p2 = 3p - exp(-r/§). (47)

Tb2r

We remind that & sets the size of the "thermal blob" [3] cor- responding to a free energy due to the effective monomer interaction of order kBT. If one considers short subchains of arc-length s < g or small distances r < §, the (sub)chains behave as if they were barely interacting, i.e. S(q) ~ F (q). If on the other side one focuses on the physical properties be- yond the thermal blob scale (s » g, r » §, q<1/§) where the structure factor becomes constant, S(q) ~ g(¿), one may renormalize all spatial distances by § and all curvilinear dis- tances by g and in these terms the system should behave as an incompressible packing of thermal blobs [3].

We emphasize that the perturbation results [4] Eq. (45) and Eq. (46) are supposed to apply only as long as the com- pressibility g is not too small and the screening length § remains a respectable length, in any case much larger than the lattice constant o.24 Formally, this is expressed by the criterion [4, 83, 84]

Gz = p(bg1/2)d

g (vp)d/2-1 d -< 1,

(48)

with the Ginzburg parameter Gz being the small parameter of the standard perturbation theory. Note that Eq. (48) sets a lower bound to the correlation length § >> b/(pbd)1/(d-1).

Please also note that Eq. (44), Eq. (46) and Eq. (48) are consistent with relations given by Edwards [4]. (For in- stance, Eq. (48) corresponds to Eq. (5.46) of Ref. [4].) The only difference is that following [18,84] we have replaced the second virial coefficient v2 of the monomers by the effec- tive bulk modulus v and the bond length of the unperturbed chain by the effective bond length b.

## 2.3.4 Correlation hole effects



Let us for the clarity of the presentation return to monodis- perse chains in the large -¿ limit, i.e. let us assume that g << 1 and that thus the total monomer density p does not fluctu- ate. On the other hand, composition fluctuations of labeled chains or subchains may certainly occur, however, subject

24 We remind that from the thermodynamic point of view the funda- mental property characterizing the solution is the dimensionless com- pressibility g and not the correlation length §.

We argue instead that the incompressibility constraint on all length scales s matters - and not just for s ~ N - leading to a short distance repulsion us of their "subchain correlation holes" which increases with decreasing s.

Data for different s ≤ N are successfully scaled tracing u(r, s)/us as a function of r/Rs with u = s/pR3. The potential is positive and roughly Gaussian (bold line) for small r/Rs where the (sub)chains repel each other. It becomes weakly attractive for distances r/R$ ~ 0.7 (vertical arrow).

to the total density constraint. Composition fluctuations are therefore coupled and chains and subchains must feel an en- tropic penalty when the distance r between their CM be- comes comparable to their typical size [94,82].

As sketched in Fig. 3(a), let us first remind the well- known "correlation hole" effect for two test chains of length N in the bath [4,94]. The scaling of their effective interac- tion under the incompressibility constraint is obtained from the potential of mean force u(r,N) =- ln(p(r,N)/p(co,N)) [117] with p(r,N) being the pair correlation function of the chains, i.e. the probability distribution to find the CM of the second chain at a distance r assuming the CM of the first chain at the origin (r = 0). Since the correlation hole is shal- low for large N, expansion of the logarithm leads to

u(r, N) ~ 1 - P(r; N) ~ 1 _ P - PN (r) _PN (r) p(,N) p p

(49)

with PN(r) being the density distribution of the reference chain around its CM. This distribution scales as

## PN(r) ~ PNf(r/RN)



## (50)



with px ~ N/Ry being the chain self-density, Eq. (1), and f(x) a universal function which becomes constant for x << 1 and decays rapidly for x >> 1.25 The interaction penalty for two chains at r/RN « 1 is thus given by

u(0,N) ~ UN= PN/P=N/PRA ~ N1-d/2 (51) which decreases as ux ~ 1/VN in d = 3 [94,82]. Hence, although the incompressibility constraint couples the chains, the correlations become rapidly negligible with increasing chain length N in agreement with our discussion in Sec. 1.1.

Interestingly, the above scaling argument does not only hold for chains (s = N - 1) but also for the potential of

25 For (to leading order) Gaussian chains f (x) must also be Gaussian [3] as indicated by the bold line in Fig. 4.

mean force u(r,s) =- ln(p(r,s)/p(co,s)) obtained in a sim- ilar manner from the pair correlation function p(r,s) of the center-of masses of subchains of arc-length s ≤ N - 1 [82, 84]. Since

∗ u s =(N/s)d/2-1 = \N/s >> 1 for s «N,

(52)

∗ u

N

the correlation hole effect strongly increases with decreasing s, albeit it remains always perturbative in d = 3. Note that the subchain correlation hole potential us does not depend explicitly on the bulk compression modulus v. It is dimen- sionless and independent of the definition of the monomer unit, i.e. it does not change if À monomers are regrouped to form an effective monomer (p -> p/2, s -> s/2) while keeping Rs fixed.

That the effective correlation hole potential for chains and subchains is more than a heuristic scaling argument can be seen from Fig. 4. We present here the rescaled poten- tial of mean force u(r, s) for chains of length N = 4096 ob- tained using the BFM algorithm described in Sec. 3.3. The correlation hole potential for the total chains is indicated by the squares. The predicted scaling is confirmed by the per- fect data collapse of u(r,s)/us plotted as function of r/Rs. Please note that, strictly speaking, u(r,s) for subchains ac- counts also for the attractive interaction between subchains on the same chain and therefore differs slightly from the ef- fective interaction potential of two independent chains of length N = s+1. This leads to the (very weak) attractive contribution to u(r, s) for subchains (barely) visible in Fig. 4. However, this additional effect does not affect the scaling on short distances, r << Rs, which matters here.

## 2.3.5 Connectivity and swelling



To connect two test chains of length N to form a chain of length 2N an effective free energy ux has to be paid and this repulsion will push the two halves apart from each other [94]. We consider next a subchain of length s in the middle of a very long chain. All interactions between the test subchain and the rest of the chain are first switched off but we keep all other interactions, especially within the subchain and be- tween the subchain monomers and monomers of surround- ing chains. The typical size Rs of the test subchain remains essentially unchanged from the size of an independent chain of the same strand length. If we now switch on the interac- tions between the tagged subchain and monomers on adja- cent subchains of same length s, this corresponds to an effec- tive interaction of order us as before. (The effect of switch- ing on the interaction to all other monomers of the chain is inessential at scaling level, since these other monomers are more distant.) Since this repels the respective subchains from each other, the corresponding subchain is swollen com- pared to a Gaussian chain of non-interacting subchains. It is this effect we want to characterize.

## 2.3.6 Perturbation approach in three dimensions



Let us return to systems of finite dimensionless compress- ibility g but let us focus on subchains of length s which are larger than the number of monomers g contained in the ther- mal blob, i.e. we focus on scales where the incompressibil- ity constraint matters. Interestingly, when taken at s = g the subchain correlation hole potential becomes

∗

u

g = Gz

22 p(bg1/2)d

(53)

with Gz being the standard Ginzburg parameter already de- fined in Eq. (48). Hence, it follows for the subchain correla- tion hole potential that

us ~ Gz(g/s)d/2-1 « Gz for d > 2 and s >> g.

(54) Although for real polymer melts as for computational sys- tems large values of Gz ~ 1 may sometimes be found, us ~ 1/Vs decreases rapidly with s in three dimensions, as il- lustrated in Fig. 3(b), and standard perturbation calculations can be successfully performed.

As sketched in Sec. 2.4 these calculations consider di- mensionless quantities [u*] which are defined such that they vanish (% [u* = 0] = 0) if the perturbation potential us is switched off and are then shown to scale, to leading order, linearly with u *. For instance, for the quantity Kp(s), defined in Eq. (26), characterizing the deviation of the subchain size from Flory's hypothesis one thus expects the scaling

Kplus] = +us ~+d (55) .

s

The +-sign indicated marks the fact that the prefactor has to be positive to be consistent with the expected swelling of the chains. Consequently, the rescaled mean-squared subchain

size, R3/b2s ~ 1 - us, must approach the asymptotic limit for large s from below. For 3D melts Eq. (55) implies that Kp(s) should vanish rapidly as 1/(pb3 /s).26 Taking apart the prefactors - which require a full calculation - this corresponds exactly to Eq. (10) with a swelling coefficient Cs ~ 1/pb3. Note also that the predicted deviations are in- versely proportional to b3, i.e. the more flexible the chains, the more pronounced the effect. Similar relations ( [u]] ~ u's may also be formulated for other quantities and will be tested numerically in Sec. 5.

## 2.4 Perturbation calculation



## 2.4.1 General approach



We remind that the first-order perturbation calculation of an observable & under a dimensionless perturbation potential U « 1 (defined in units of T) generally reads [4]

A (1-U)0 (0(1-0) =(A)+(U)o (A) - (VA ) (56)

where averages performed over an unperturbed reference sys- tem of Gaussian chains are denoted ( ... ),. Obviously, (4) = (0) for U = 0. For the reduced quantity B ==- 10 Eq. (56) simplifies to

(B) ~- {U B)o .

(57)

For (@), # 0 one may introduce the dimensionless observ- able 6 = - B | (s), which, of course, also obeys Eq. (57). If (CU), ~ (U),, as is the case if self-energies and ultra- violet divergencies can be dumped into the reference of U, this is consistent with Eq. (55). The observable o stands, for instance, for the 2p-th moment d = I'm of the vector Inm = Lm - In between two monomers n and m = n +s on the tagged chain as shown in Fig. 1 [80,84] or for the scalar product / = Ln . Lm/12 of two bond vectors [87,89]. If, as in the latter case, we have () = 0 for linear chains by con- struction, one only has to compute (of) = (B) ~ - (UB)o.

In this subsection we use bo = v2dao for the bond length of the unperturbed Gaussian reference chain which may a priori be different from the effective bond length b = v2da defined and measured according to Eq. (17). The reference bond length b0 is a parameter which may be suitably cho- sen or adjusted in a Hartree-Fock iteration scheme [23] (as shown in Sec. 5.3.3) for the specific problem and observable considered. If one is, for instance, interested in predicting the effective bond length b for a weakly interacting system, a good trial value for b0 should be the bond length l of non- interacting chains on the lattice [4]. To be consistent the per- turbation potential U must in this case vanish if the interac- tions are switched off (v = 0). If on the other side the aim is to characterize the deviations from Flory's ideality hypoth- esis in incompressible melts (g << 1) one may naturally set

26 This is different in thin films where u' ~ Gz decays only logarith- mically [94].

b0 = b, i.e. one uses as reference the Gaussian chain which fits the chain on large scales (Sec. 2.4.5). Obviously, in this case the perturbation potential U must vanish in this low- wavevector limit such that (6) ~- (CU> > 0. The last choice for b0 turns out to be the best one in all cases where one does not need to predict the effective bond length b but where it can be determined independently by fitting some large scale intrachain property such as the typical chain end- to-end distance RN.

The perturbation energy for a tagged test chain of length Nt is given by the potential

(58) U ={"dk f"dl v(k).

As further discussed in Sec. 2.4.2, the effective interaction ~(r) between two monomers of the test chain arises due to the presence of the bath of surrounding chains which screens the direct excluded volume interaction vô(r). The calcula- tions are most readily performed in Fourier-Laplace space using definitions given in Sec. 2.2.3. See for instance the calculation presented in Appendix B.2 for the non-Gaussian contribution 8G(r,s) = G(r,s) - Go(r,s) to the subchain size distribution or Appendix B.4 for the bond-bond correlation function P1(s).

## 2.4.2 Effective interaction potential



We have still to specify the effective monomer interaction (q) = [~(r)] in reciprocal space with q being the wavevec- tor conjugated to the distance between two monomers n and m of the tagged chain. Note that in general the test chain length Nt and the mean chain length (N) of the bath may differ. Within linear response the effective pair interaction reads [4, 83]

## 1 1 +F0(q).



(59)

~(q)p vp

The first term stands here for the bare excluded volume in- teraction v between monomers. As we have already stressed above, Eq. (43), thermodynamic consistency requires that v is set by the excess contribution to the isothermal compress- ibility of the solution: v= 1/gp [18,83,86, 125].27 Fo(q) stands for the ideal chain intramolecular form factor of the bath of chains surrounding the reference chain. According to Eq. (38) the effective interaction v(q) depends thus in gen- eral on the length distribution PN of the bath. We remind that for Flory-distributed melts the form factor is given by Eq. (40). Replacing u by 2/N this corresponds to the Padé approximation, Eq. (37), of the awkward Debye function for monodisperse chains.

Let us first assume that Fo(q) >> S(q) ~ g, i.e. we assume q << 1/o in incompressible solutions (g << 1) and q < 1/§ for systems with a well-defined thermal blob (g >> 1). The effective interaction is then given by

~(q)p ~ Fo(a) 1 for q < 1/§ and q < 1/0, (60)

27 The bulk modulus v only dominates (q) for all q in extremely compressible systems where g > Fo(0) = {N2} / {N).

i.e. the effective interaction is given alone by the inverse structure factor of the bath and does not depend explicitly on the compressibility g of the solution.28 According to Eq. (39) the effective potential becomes in the low-wavevector limit

Ño =~ (q-> 0) = (N2) p (N) for q << 1/Rg,z, (61)

i.e. o = 2u/p for Flory-distributed melts and Ño = 1/pN for monodisperse melts. Long test chains are ruled by vo which acts as a weak repulsive pseudo-potential with asso- ciated Fixman parameter z ~ ~ ovNt [4].29 It follows that

z > 1 for N( > (N)2 / (N)2 ~ (N)2 (62)

and the chains thus must swell and obey excluded volume statistics [3,7].30 We note that for a Flory-distributed bath Eq. (60) becomes

~(q)p ~~ ((aoq)2 + u) for q < 1/8 and q < 1/0 (63)

which can also be used within the Padé approximation (u = 2/N) for the calculation of monodisperse systems [80,84]. More importantly, the effective potential becomes for inter- mediate wavevectors

v(a)p~ (a09)2 N for 1/Rg,z << q << 1/§ (64)

and this irrespective of the length distribution pN of the bath. Eq. (64) lies at the heart of the announced power-law swell- ing of (sub)chains, Eq. (9) or Eq. (55) [80,83,84, 87].

For later reference in Sec. B.4 we note that for a Flory- distributed bath of finite compressibility the pair potential reads

~(q) = v (aoq)2+ (ao/§)2 (aoq)2 + u for q << 1/0 and ug <1 (65)

where §2 = agg/2 = a3/2vp following Eq. (44). Allowing to characterize wavevectors below and above 1/§, Eq. (65) reduces to Eq. (61) for very low wavevectors and to Eq. (64) in the intermediate wavevector range. In the limit of asymp- totically long chains (u -> 0) Eq. (65) becomes [4]

~(q) = v q2 + §-2 q2 for 1/Rg,z << q << 1/ (66)

which corresponds in real space to [4]

v(r) =v (8(r)-

, 4πξ2r exp(-r/§) - (67)

28 Since we shall set b0 = b at the end of calculation and since the effective bond length b depends on g, the effective potential v(q) de- pends implicitly on g.

29 Characterizing the excluded volume interaction free energy of a chain with itself the Fixman parameter of a chain of length N of ex- cluded volume v may be defined more generally as

z(N) = v(N/RN)2RN ~ (v/bd) N2-d/2.

Note that for a monodisperse melt of chain length N = g and di- mensionless compressibility g = 1/vp the Fixman parameter and the Ginzburg parameter become identical, z(N = g) = Gz.

30 For this reason an upper bound is indicated, e.g., in Eq. (106).

13

i.e. the effective potential consists of a strongly repulsive part vô (r) of very short range (r ~ 0), and an attractive part of range § stemming from the compression of the reference chain by the bath chains.31 Using Eq. (66) it follows that

/ dr v(x) = v(9) =0

(68)

q=0

which is commonly taken as a proof that "there is no ex- cluded volume interaction among the segments whose mean separation is larger than §" [4]. Unfortunately, Eq. (68) does not imply mathematically that all other moments, say the in- tegral over v(r)_2P, should also rigorously vanish. It is thus incorrect to state that all possible correlation functions must be short-ranged. However, it remains relevant that v(q) ~ q2 vanishes with decreasing wavevector and the same applies for the total perturbation U (q) to the Gaussian reference.32

## 2.4.3 Free energy for high compressibilities



For later use in Sec. 4 we reformulate here a perturbation calculation result obtained long ago by Edwards [4] using Eq. (66) which allows to predict thermodynamic properties of melts with sufficiently large compressibilities g. Integrat- ing twice with respect to the density p the osmotic pres- sure given by Eq. (5.45) or Eq. (5.II.5) of [4] one obtains for monodisperse melts the free energy per monomer

1 Bf(β) = Beself + -log(po3/N)+-v2p 1

1 1 with §2 12 12v2P

− 12π ξ3ρ

(69)

and B = 1/T being the inverse temperature, bo = I the bond length of the Gaussian reference chains and v2(B) the sec- ond virial coefficient of a solution of unconnected mono- mers. The first term Beself is due to the (essentially constant) intrachain self-energy which shall be discussed in Sec. 4.2. It is due to the reference energy chosen in our numerical model Hamiltonian and it is normally not accessible experimen- tally. A similar intrachain energy contribution to the free en- ergy arises also from Eq. (5.43) of [4] if an upper cutoff qmax is introduced for the wavevectors q to avoid the ultra-violet divergence. Such an upper cutoff is justified by the discrete- ness of the monomers of real polymers. This leads necessar- ily to a non-universal free energy contribution which can be seen as an integration constant with respect to the integration of a measurable property such as the osmotic pressure or the compressibility. The second term in Eq. (69) represents the translational invariance of monodisperse chains of length N (van't Hoff's law). Due to this contribution the compressibil- ities depend in general on N as will be discussed in Sec. 4.4.33 i == 12 νξ bos + to The (bare) excluded volume interaction between the mono- mers is accounted for by the third term. The underlined term I+ = I_ 9 V 24 TC3 boP bổ s

32 Hence, (%) -> 0 in the large-scale limit for an observable & which suggests bo = b for the Gaussian chain reference bond length.

33 For general polydisperse melts of given partial densities PN = PPN/ (N) the ideal gas contribution becomes EN PN log(pN)/p.

in the second line represents the leading correction to the previous term due to the fact that the monomers are con- nected by bonds summing over the density fluctuations to quadratic order. As one expects [3], the corresponding cor- relations of the density fluctuations reduce the free energy by about one kBT per thermal blob of volume §3. Interest- ingly, according to Edwards [4] the chain connectivity, i.e. the presence of attractive forces between bonded monomers, does not change the excluded volume v2 - as one would expect naively - but rather gives rise to an additional term scaling differently with density.34 Various thermodynamic properties are readily obtained from the quoted free energy and will be compared with our numerical results in Sec. 4. The underlined density fluctuation contribution to the free energy will be demonstrated numerically from the scaling of the specific heat cv (Sec. 4.3).

As the reader might have noticed we have written the free energy in Eq. (69) following Edwards assuming v = V2 for the bare monomer interaction and bo = l for the bond length of the Gaussian reference chain. As already alluded to above (Sec. 2.4.1), one would nowadays rather set v = 1/gp and bo = b using the imposed or measured dimensionless compressibility g and the measured effective bond length b. However, the choice of Edwards has a clear advantage: g and b may not be known with sufficient precision while the second virial coefficient v2 and the bond length l can always be calculated from the given model Hamiltonian. Accord- ing to Eq. (5.46) of Ref. [4] the stated free energy is sup- posed to hold in the limit where Gz « 1 with Gz ~ 1/ /g being the Ginzburg parameter. As we shall see in Sec. 4, this restricts the validity of the related predictions to rather weak values of the (reduced) Lagrange multiplier ¿/T ap- plied to control the compressibility. In the range of validity of Eq. (69) it turns out that v2 ~ 1/gp and l ~ b, i.e. the difference between both parameter choices correspond to ir- relevant higher order corrections.

## 2.4.4 Subchain size distribution and its moments



We turn now to the perturbation calculation predictions of intrachain conformational properties which will be compar- ed with our numerical data in Sec. 5. We focus first on the scale-free wavevector regime for arbitrarily long chains de- scribed by the effective interaction potential Eq. (66), i.e. effects related to the chain length distribution py are irrele- vant. For the observable & = Lnm with 1 << n<m =n+s << Nt we indicate in Fig. 5(a) the different interaction graphs one may compute in real space [80]

24 Tt3 bOP -45 boys

34 A free energy contribution ~ 1/Ryp ~ 1/N3/2 may be added to Eq. (69) if one insists on taking as reference for the connectivity con- tribution to the free energy the limit g -> N, i.e. § -> RN, where the chain connectivity becomes irrelevant.

The dashed lines indicate the effective monomer interaction v(r) between two monomers k and / on the chain whose distance is weighted using the Gaussian propaga- tor Go(r, |k - 1]). (a) The calculation of the subchain size R2 requires the computation of four graphs, the dominant contribution stemming from the interactions of monomers within the subchain. The numerical factors indicate the relative weights contributing to the 1/vs predicted by Eq. (10) [80,84]. (b) The direct calculation of the bond-bond cor- relation function P1 (s) is simplified by choosing two bonds 41 and Z2 outside the s-segment.

The diagram I¡ corresponds to the standard graph computed by Edwards for the total chain (s = Nt - 1) [4]. Consistent with Edwards its leading Gaussian contribution describes how the effective bond length is increased from b0 to b under the influence of a small excluded volume interaction inside the subchain between n and m. Note that all other contri- butions proportional to Vs correspond to the leading non- Gaussian corrections predicted in Eq. (10). They only de- pend on bo and p but, more importantly, not on v in agree- ment with the scaling discussed in Sec. 2.3.6. The relative weights of these four contributions are indicated in Fig. 5(a) in units of -boys/(v24m3 bop). The dominant correction stems from the interaction I; within the subchain. The di- agrams 14 and I_ are obviously identical in the scale-free limit.35 Summing over all contributions this yields

35 Using Eq. (4) it follows that the interactions described by the strongest graph I; align the bonds L, and L, while the others tend to re- duce the effect [80]. As shown in Fig. 5(b), it is better to place the bond pair outside the subchain if one computes PI (s) directly (Sec. 2.4.6 and Sec. B.4). For symmetry reasons only the interaction graph Io between the dangling ends matters for the alignment of the bond pair. Both pic- tures are consistent and lead to the same result.

For higher moments of the distribution G(r, s) it is con- venient to calculate first the perturbation deviations of the Fourier-Laplace transformation 8G(q,t) = L\][&G(r,s)] with 8G(r,s) = G(r,s) - Go(r,s) and to obtain the moments from the coefficients of the expansion of this "generating function" in terms of the squared wavevector q2.

## 2.4.5 Adjusting the bond length of the reference chain



The above perturbation result Eq. (72) is of relevance to de- scribe the effect of a weak excluded volume v on a refer- ence system of ideal polymer melts with bond length b0 = l where all interactions have been switched off (v = 0). It is expected to give a good estimation for the effective bond length b only for a small Ginzburg parameter Gz ~ Gzo << 1. For the dense incompressible melts we want to describe the latter condition does not hold and one cannot hope to find a good quantitative agreement with Eq. (72). Note also that large wavevectors contribute strongly to the leading Gaus- sian term. The effective bond length b is, hence, strongly influenced by local and non-universal effects and is very dif- ficult to predict in general (Sec. 5.3).

Our more modest goal is to predict the coefficient of the 1/Vs-perturbation and to express it in terms of a suitable variational reference Hamiltonian characterized by a conve- niently chosen b0 and the measured effective bond length b (instead of Eq. (72)). Following Refs. [43,84] we argue that for dense melts b0 should be renormalized to b to take into account higher order graphs.36 Restating thus Eq. (73) with bo = b the subchain size distribution may be rewritten

36 The general scaling argument discussed in Sec. 2.3.6 states that we have only one relevant length scale in this problem, the typical subchain size Rs ~ by/s itself. The incompressibility constraint cannot generate an additional scale. It is this size Rs which sets the strength of the effective interaction which then in turn feeds back to the deviations of Rs from Gaussianity. Having a bond length b0 in addition to the ef- fective bond length b associated with Rs would imply a second length scale bo v/s.

which reduces for p = 1 to Eq. (10) as stated in the Intro- duction. As a consequence the non-Gaussianity parameters Kp(s) and ap(s) defined in Sec. 2.2.3 become

Eq. (78) can be obtained from Eq. (77) by expanding the second moment (p = 1) in the denominator of the definition Eq. (27).

## 2.4.6 Bond-bond correlation function



The bond-bond correlation function P1(s) is a central prop- erty since it allows to probe directly the colored forces act- ing on the reference chain due to the incompressibility con- straint, Eq. (176). Using Eq. (4) P1(s) may be obtained by differentiating the second moment R2 of the subchain size distribution G(r,s) with respect to the arc-length s. For ar- bitrarily large chains and s >> g this yields PI(s) = cp/s3/2 with cp = CooCs/8 as announced in the Introduction.

It is also possible to obtain PI(s) directly by averag- ing the observable & = Ln · Lm/12. Since for linear chains () = 0 by construction, the task is to compute Eq. (57).37 Changing slightly the notations as indicated in Fig. 5(b), we consider two bonds L1 and 22 outside the s-segment. The lengths of the two tails of the chains are denoted S1 and S2. One of the tails, say S2 = Nt - s - S1 - 1, may be fixed by the total length of the test chain. Placing the head of the first bond 41 at the origin we consider the correlation function C1(r) = (L1(0) . 12(r)) /12 between two bonds separated by the distance r = [r]. Interestingly, it can be seen by sym- metry considerations that C1(r) does only depend on the ef- fective interaction of the monomers in the first tail with the monomers in the second tail and not on the monomers in the intermediate strand of length s. Hence, we need only to cal- culate one interaction graph as opposed to the four graphs required by the calculation of PI (s) throught R2. It is for this reason we have chosen the indicated positions of heads and tails of the bond vectors. With B(L) denoting the normalized distribution of the bond vector [ of the polymer model con- sidered, the interaction graph in real space may be written

Ci (r) = - | dl1 dl2 B(41) B(12) A (11,12)

S1 S2 x Σ Σ / dridr2Go(LI+LI,$1)Go(12-12,$2)

where L'1 points from the head of the bond Z1 to the monomer $1 in the first tail and r2 from the tail of the bond 42 to

37 We remind that for closed cycles the ring closure implies long- range angular correlations even for Gaussian chains, hence for rings (0) = 100 to leading order [8].

the monomer $2 in the second dangling chain end. As the s-segment is not implied in the perturbation of C1(r), the constraint which consists in putting the two points on the same chain and putting a s-strand between them introduces, to lowest order, the Gaussian propagator G0(r,s). Using Par- seval's theorem the bond-bond correlation function reads

dq (27t)d ¡C1(q)G(q,s) (80)

P(s) = [dr. C(r) Go(r,s) =

with C1 (q) being the Fourier transform of C1(r).38 To sim- plify the notations we set from the start b0 = b, i.e. we take the effective bond length as the bond length of the Gaussian reference chain. Although this is not strictly necessary, the calculation in reciprocal space may be strongly simplified by assuming the bond vector distribution to be a Gaussian B(L) = Go(L,s = 1) with b2 = 2da2 = 12 = (12). This implies that the chain is perfectly flexible, i.e. Co. = (b/1)2 = 1.39 Under these premises a bond vector / may be represented in reciprocal space as

F \LB(1)] = idqB(q) ~ ia2 2q = - b2 q

(81)

with B(q) = ] [B(L)] = exp(-(aq)2) being the Fourier trans- formed bond vector distribution.40 Let us denote the wave- vectors conjugated to the bonds L1 and 42 by q and q2, re- spectively. The Fourier transform of the observable A (L1, L2) thus reads

₫ (91,92)= b2 -Jo91.92. (82)

Using Eq. (82) for the observable and Eq. (66) for the inter- action potential for Flory-distributed systems of given com- pressibility g one may integrate Eq. (80) in reciprocal space as shown in Appendix B.4. In the limit of very long chains (ul -> co) one obtains in d = 3 dimensions [86]

4 √

as a function of the reduced arc-length u = s/g with erfc(x) being the complementary error function [44]. As one ex- pects, Eq. (83) reduces to Eq. (9) for large u >> 1, i.e. irre- spective of the compressibility g the bond-bond correlation

38 It can be shown that for infinite chains C1 (q) = 4v(q)/(bq)2 and, hence,

C1(r) =: V Tb2, exp(-r/§) ind = 3,

i.e. C1(r) -> 0 for § -> 0 at fixed distance r. Note that C1(r) is a mere technical intermediate quantity which should not be confused with the bond-bond correlation function P1 (r) discussed in Sec. 5.4.2 and Sec. B.5.

39 The complete formula for systems of general rigidity can be recov- ered by multiplying the final perturbation calculation result with C .. as may be seen by scaling considerations [87, 89] or by simply comparing the result with the bond-bond correlations obtained using R2.

## 2.4.7 Finite chain size effects



To describe properly finite chain size corrections, Eq. (64) must be replaced by the general formula Eq. (59). For mono- disperse chains (N = (N) = Nt) the form factor Fo(q) is given by Debye's function Eq. (36). This approximation allows in principle to compute, e.g., the mean-squared total chain end- to-end distance, / = (EN - [1)2. One verifies readily (see [4], Eq. (5.III.9)) that the effect of the perturbation may be expressed as

dq (2 TT ) 3 ~(q) 4(aoq)2ao

× 10 ds 32(N-s) exp (-(aq)2).

(85)

We take now first the integral over s. In the remaining in- tegral over q small q wavevectors contribute to the vN- swelling while large q renormalize the effective bond length of the dominant Gaussian behavior linear in N (as discussed above). Since we wish to determine the non-Gaussian cor- rections, we focus on small wavevectors q << 1/§, i.e. the effective interaction potential is given by Eq. (60). We thus continue the calculation using ~(N,x)p = 1/(NpfD(x)) with fD(x) being Debye's function and x = (Rg(N)q)2 = (aoq)2N. This allows us to express the swelling as

(IN -41) 2) Cs = √ N I(xu).

(86)

b2N

We have set here b0 = b in agreement with the renormal- ization of the reference bond length discussed above. The numerical integral I(xu) = Jo" dx ... over x is slowly conver- gent at infinity. As a consequence the estimate I(co) = 1.59 may be too large for moderate chain lengths. In practice, convergence is not achieved for values xu(N) ~ (b/§)2N corresponding to the screening length §.

We remark finally that for various properties numeri- cal integration can be avoided replacing the Debye function by the Padé approximation, Eq. (63). This has been done for instance for the calculation of finite chain size effects for the bond-bond correlation function P1(s,N) discussed in Sec. 5.4.1.42

41 Omitting all prefactors we remind [4] that to leading order R2 ~ b2s(1+z(s) ... ). Using Eq. (4) it follows that P1(s) ~ 1/g/s.

42 It is interesting to compare the numerical value I(co) ~1.59 ob- tained for the r.h.s. of Eq. (86) with the coefficients one would ob-

Fig. 6 The BFM is an efficient lattice MC algorithm for coarse- grained polymer chains where monomers are represented by cubes on a simple cubic lattice (of lattice constant o) connected by a set of al- lowed bond vectors. (a) The classical BFM assumes that lattice sites are at most occupied once. The panel shows the recently proposed variant with finite excluded volume penalty [86]. An energy ¿ has to be paid if two cubes totally overlap. A corresponding fraction is as- sociated with the partial monomer overlap, as sketched for two cube corners. (b) Using local MC jump attempts to the next (filled circles) and next-nearest (open circles) neighbors we investigate in Sec. 6 the influence of the incompressibility constraint on the dynamics of over- damped polymer melts without topological interactions. (c) Using hard and structureless walls systems of reduced effective dimension d < 3 may be investigated as outlined in Sec. 6.2 and Sec. 7.2.1.

## 3 Bond-fluctuation model



## 3.1 Introduction



The theoretical predictions sketched above should hold in any dense homopolymer solution assuming that the chains are asymptotically long, i.e. at least N/g >> 102 and even better N/g >> 103. The computational challenge is to equili- brate and to sample such configurations using an as simple as possible coarse-grained model for polymer melts [21,29]. In this study we use the BFM, an efficient lattice MC algo- rithm proposed as an alternative to single-site self-avoiding walk models by Carmesin and Kremer in 1988 [28]. As il- lustrated in Fig. 6, the key idea of the model is to increase the size of the monomers which now occupy whole unit cells on a simple cubic lattice connected by a specified set of allowed bond vectors. While the multitude of possible bond lengths and angles allows a better representation of the continuous-space behavior of real polymer solutions and melts, the model remains sufficiently simple retaining thus the computational efficiency of lattice models without being plagued by ergodicity problems [29]. The BFM algorithm has been used for a huge range of problems addressing the generic behavior of long polymer chains of very different molecular architectures and geometries: statics and dynam-

tain by computing Eq. (85) either with the effective potential v(q) for infinite chains given by Eq. (66) or with the Padé approximation, Eq. (63). Within these approximations of the full linear response for- mula, Eq. (59), the coefficients can be obtained directly without nu- merical integration yielding overall similar values. In the first case we obtain 15/8 ~ 1.87 and in the second 11/8 ~ 1.37 [84]. While the first value is clearly not compatible with the measured end-to-end distances, the second yields a reasonable fit, especially for small N < 1000.

Throughout this paper all lengths and densities are given in units of the lattice constant o, time scales are given in units of the Monte Carlo Step (MCS) and Boltzmann's con- stant kg is set to unity. Taking apart some paragraphs in Sec. 4 we assume a temperature T = 1. If not specified oth- erwise the chains are monodisperse of length N.

We define first the classical BFM variant without mono- mer overlap (¿ = 0) and explain then how dense configura- tions may be obtained using a mix of local and global MC moves (Sec. 3.3). The generalization of the BFM Hamilto- nian to finite monomer overlap penalties ¿ is presented in Sec. 3.4. Finally, we turn in Sec. 3.5 to polydisperse equilib- rium polymer systems with annealed size distribution.

Fig. 7 Diffusion time TN = R2/6DN vs. chain length N for different versions of the BFM without monomer overlap. All data are for our standard volume fraction ¢ = 0.5. The BFM version with topology conserving local "L06 moves" is represented by stars. All other data sets use topology violating local "L26 moves" [84]. The L26 dynamics (diamonds) is essentially Rouse-like which allows the determination of DN although the monomers have not yet moved over RN for the largest chains considered. Additional "slithering snake" (SS) moves increase the efficiency of the algorithm by approximately an order of magnitude (squares, bold line). A power-law exponent 1.6+0.1 (dashed line) is found if "double bridging" (DB) moves are included.

## 3.2 Classical BFM without monomer overlap



The classical implementations of the BFM idea do not per- mit monomer overlap, i.e. each monomer occupies exclu- sively a unit cell of 2ª lattice sites on a d-dimensional sim- ple cubic lattice [28,29,30]. The fraction ø of occupied lat- tice sites is thus $ = 2dp with p being the d-dimensional monomer number density. A widely used choice for the al- lowed bond vectors for the 3D variant (d = 3) of the BFM in- troduced by the Mainz condensed matter theory group around K. Binder [50,51,52,53, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130] is given by

where P stands for all the possible permutations and sign combinations of a lattice vector. This corresponds to 108 different bond vectors ¿ of 5 possible bond lengths (2, v5, v6, 3, v10) and 100 angles between consecutive bonds. The smallest 13 angles do not appear for the classical BFM because excluded volume forbids the sharp backfolding of bonds. If only local hopping moves to the 2d = 6 nearest neighbor sites are performed - called "L06 moves" [84] - this set of vectors ensures automatically that polymer chains cannot cross. (The corresponding "L04 moves" for the 2D variant of the BFM are represented in Fig. 6(b) by filled circles.) Topological constraints, e.g. in ring polymers [132, 121, 133] or polymer gels [139], hence are conserved.43

43 Following [50,51] we keep lists of the monomer positions in ab- solute space, their corresponding lattice positions and of the indices 1 ≤ i ≤ 108 of the bond vectors connecting the monomers of the chains. Since the bond vector index can be encoded as a byte, this allows a rather compact storage of the configurations. Predefined tables allow

Consequently, several authors report reptation-type dy- namics for chain lengths N > Ne ~ 102 at a standard "melt" volume fraction ø = 8p = 0.5 [50,51,56,57].44 As may be seen from the stars indicated in Fig. 7, the relaxation time TN obtained using L06 moves [84] becomes similar to the rep- tation theory prediction TN ~ N3 (dash-dotted line). We have used here - as elsewhere if not stated otherwise - periodic simulation boxes of linear dimension L = 256 containing nmon = pL3 = 220 ~ 106 monomers. This large system size allows to eliminate finite-size effects even for the longest chain lengths studied. The relaxation time IN = R2/6DN has been estimated here (for historical reasons) using the self- diffusion coefficient DN obtained either from the monomer MSD h(t) or the chain CM MSD hN(t). Other operational definitions of TN exist [51,56] which lead to similar, verti- cally slightly shifted results. The last data point for N = 1024 has to be taken with care as usual in computational as in ex- perimental studies [157]. Being obtained by extrapolation using the expected shape of hN(t)/t in log-linear coordi-

the rapid verification of the excluded volume condition on the periodic lattice. Following Müller [134,30] we use a Wigner-Seitz representa- tion of the cubic lattice where a cube is not represented by 8 entries on the lattice but just by one variable in the cube center. This variable can be a boolean if we are only interested in homopolymers or an integer if we deal with a mixture of different monomer types. Although the Wigner-Seitz representation of the BFM algorithm is about a factor 3 slower than the original implementation, it has the advantage that the code becomes more compact and can be more readily adapted to the various polymer architectures or interaction potentials of interest.

44 The BFM version by Shaffer [54,55] assumes a different bond vec- tor set which leads to a higher chain stiffness Co. and, hence, to smaller values of the entanglement length Ne. Note that if one applies a local stiffness potential, as discussed Sec. 2.2, one finds quite generally that topological effects become more pronounced [52, 121, 133].

Fig. 8 Two-dimensional sketch of the global MC moves used: (a) Monomers move collectively along the chain if a slithering snake move is performed. Effectively, this amounts to removing a monomer (the striped one on the left), connecting it to the other end of the chain and leaving the middle monomers unchanged. Therefore, density fluctu- ations and constraint release only occurs at the chain end. At higher volume fractions it is thus necessary to add local hopping moves, as shown at the top of the panel to maintain the computational efficiency [49]. (b) Connectivity altering double bridging (DB) moves are very useful at high densities allowing us to extend the accessible molecular mass up to N = 8192 [84]. Since density fluctuations do not couple to DB moves, local moves again must be added.

nates, it corresponds to a lower bound for TN. Note that the relaxation time appears thus to increase even more strongly with N than the standard reptation theory predicts [4]. We do not pursue this issue here (which has also been observed in MD simulations) the important point being merely that local topology conserving moves are too inefficient to equilibrate and sample large-N polymer melts.

Note that the classical BFM without monomer overlap and using L06 moves is strictly speaking not ergodic, since some configurations may be easily constructed which are not accessible starting from an initial configuration of stretched linear chains. Although topology conservation is irrelevant for the present work (taking apart the preliminary results presented in Sec. 6.5) we keep the set of allowed bond vec- tors, Eq. (87), for consistency with previous work.

MSD hN(t) even for our largest chains with N = 8192. As shown in Fig. 7, we find TN ~ 530N2 for L26 dynamics. This is, of course, still prohibitive for the longest chains we aim to characterize.

L26 moves yield configurations not accessible with L06 moves. Concerning the static properties both system classes are practically equivalent. This has been confirmed by count- ing the number of monomers which become "blocked" (in absolute space or with respect to an initial group of neigh- bor monomers) once one returns to the L06 scheme. Typi- cally, we find about 10 blocked monomers for a system of 220 monomers [84]. While the few blocked monomers are irrelevant for static properties they obviously matter if dy- namical properties are probed.45

## 3.3.2 Slithering snake moves



In addition to these local moves one slithering snake move per chain is attempted on average per MCS corresponding to the displacement of N monomers along the chain back- bone, as sketched in Fig. 8(a). Note that in our units two displacement attempts per MCS are performed on average per monomer, one for a local move and one for a snake move.46 Interestingly, a significantly larger slithering snake attempt frequency would not be useful since the relaxation time of snakes without or only few local moves increases exponentially with mass as shown in [48,49] due to the cor- related motion of snakes expected in analogy to the acti- vated reptation limit for real polymer melts mentioned in Sec. 1.4 [46,47]. In order to obtain an efficient free snake diffusion [with an N-independent curvilinear diffusion coef- ficient Dc(N) ~ Nº and TN ~ N2 / Dc(N) ~ N2 [49,33] it is important to relax density fluctuations rapidly by local dy- namical pathways. As shown in Fig. 7 (squares), we find a much reduced relaxation time TN ~ 40N2 which is, how- ever, still inconveniently large for our longest chains. Note that most of the CPU time is used by the local moves and the computational load per MCS remains N-independent.

## 3.3 Local and global topology violating MC moves



## 3.3.3 Double bridging moves



To equilibrate and sample BFM melts such as the ones pre- sented in Fig. 7, we have replaced the realistic but very slow L06 moves by a mix of local topology violating so-called "L26 moves" [84] with global "slithering snake" [32, 33,49] and "double bridging" [36,37,73,29] MC moves as shown in Fig. 8.

## 3.3.1 Local L26 moves



Already the use of local moves to the 3d - 1 = 26 next and next-nearest lattice sites surrounding the current monomer position [Fig. 6(b)] dramatically speeds up the relaxation dy- namics, especially for N > 512, as can be seen from the di- amonds indicated in Fig. 7. Since the dynamics is to leading order of Rouse-type, as further discussed in Sec. 6, the dif- fusion coefficient DN can readily be estimated from the CM

Double bridging (DB) moves are found to be very useful at high densities and help us to extend the accessible molecu- lar masses close to N ~ 104. As for slithering snake moves we use all 108 bond vectors to switch chain segments be- tween two different chains. Only chain segments of equal length are swapped to conserve monodispersity. Topological constraints are again deliberately violated. Since more than one swap partner is possible for a selected first monomer, delicate detailed balance questions arise [29]. This is par- ticularly important for short chains. To avoid the compu- tation of weights [29] one simple solution to this problem

45 The same problems arise if slithering snake or double bridging moves are used to equilibrate the configurations.

46 It is computationally more efficient for large N to take off a monomer at one chain end and to paste it at the other leaving all other monomers unaltered. Before static or dynamical measurements are per- formed the original order of the monomers must then be restored.

Table 1 Various properties for monodisperse BFM melts at volume fraction ø = 0.5: the dimensionless compressibility g, the root-mean- square bond length l, the effective bond length b, the acceptance rate A, the local monomer mobility W and the self-diffusion coefficient DN. The dynamical data refer to local L26 moves to the nearest and next- nearest lattice sites which yields essentially Rouse-like dynamics. The values of the dimensionless compressibility g and the effective bond length b for asymptotically long chains have been obtained using ex- trapolation schemes discussed in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5, respectively.

bond length (|Z|) ~2.604, a root-mean-squared bond length l ~ 2.636 and an effective bond length b ~ 3.24 as will be shown below in Sec. 5.3. This corresponds to a ratio Coo = (b/l)2 ~ 1.52 and, hence, to a persistence length lp = I(C .. + 1)/2 ~ 3.32. The swelling coefficient cs = \24/ 73 /b3 p de- fined in Sec. 1.5 is thus cs ~ 0.41. Especially, we find from the zero wavevector limit of the total structure factor S(q) a dimensionless compressibility g ~ 0.246 [Eq. (43)] which compares well with real experimental melts. From the mea- sured bulk compression modulus v= 1/g(p)p ~66 and the effective bond length b one estimates a Ginzburg parameter Gz=vp/b3p ~ 0.96. Following Ref. [18] the interaction parameter v is supposed here to be given by the full inverse compressibility and not just by the second virial coefficient V2 = 27 of the BFM monomers [127].

## 3.4 BFM with finite excluded volume penalty



## 3.4.1 Definition of Hamiltonian



is to refuse all moves with more than one swap partner.47 The configurations are screened with a frequency fDB for possible DB moves where we scan in random order over the monomers. The frequency should not be too large to avoid (more or less) immediate back swaps and monomers should move at least over a couple of lattice constants be- tween subsequent DB moves. In the example presented in Fig. 7 (spheres) a frequency fDB = 0.1 is used. Empirically it is found that TN ~ 13N1.6 0.1 using the diffusion coefficient DN obtained from the monomer MSD h(t). For N = 8192 this corresponds to 3 × 107 MCS. This allowed us even for the largest chains to observe monomer diffusion over several RN within the 108 MCS which were feasible in 2007 on our XEON-PC processor cluster [84]. The influence of fDB on the performance has yet not been explored systematically, but preliminary results suggest smaller DB frequencies for future studies. The power-law exponent ~ 3/2 remains ro- bust as is also confirmed by MD simulations of a bead-spring model coupled to DB moves [84]. This finding begs for a systematic theoretical investigation.

## 3.3.4 Summary of static properties



Some static properties obtained at our reference volume frac- tion Ø = 0.5 assuming no monomer overlap (€ = 0) are indi- cated in Table 1. Averages are performed over all chains and typically 1000 configurations. Taking apart the systems for N = 8192, chains are always much smaller than the linear box size L = 256. In the large N-limit we obtain an average

47 Since we have a finite number of possible BFM bonds an even simpler option is to select randomly one bond vector ¿ for a given first monomer at a lattice position r and to check whether a suitable monomer of another chain exists at r + Z. Obviously, using only one instead of 108 bonds reduces the number of DB moves performed, but since correlated moves forth and back in topology space are pointless, this is not of disadvantage.

Fig. 6 shows how finite energy penalties may be introduced in the BFM algorithm [86]. The overlap of two cube corners on one lattice site (Nov = 1) corresponds to an energy cost of 8/8, the full overlap of two monomers (Nov = 8) to an energy &. More generally, with Nov being the total number of interacting cube corners the total interaction energy of a configuration is

E = - Nov. 8

(88)

With the energies of the final (Ef) and the initial configura- tions (E;) we accept a proposed MC move according to the Metropolis criterion with a probability min(1, exp[-(Ef - Ei)/T]) [26,27]. If the overlap penalty is the only energy scale as in the studies presented here, one may, of course, either vary the overlap parameter & or the temperature T. For the presentation of thermodynamic properties in Sec. 4 it will be more naturally to use T as the control parameter and to fix arbitrarily ¿ = 1. The inverse temperature ß = 1/T and the dimensionless overlap strength x = €/T are thus numeri- cally equal. (Both notations are kept for dimensional reasons and for future generalization to models with more than one energy scale.) In other parts of this review, especially Sec. 5 and Sec. 6, it will be more natural to set temperature to unity, T = 1, using the overlap strength & as the control parameter.

## 3.4.2 Second virial coefficient



To illustrate this finite excluded volume interaction we in- dicate the second virial of an imperfect gas of unconnected monomers, v2 = _ do(1-e-E(d)/T), which is shown below to be useful for roughly characterizing the effective strength of the potential. & stands for a possible lattice vector be- tween the centers of two interacting cubes. It is easy to see that there are 8 vectors corresponding to Nov = 1 as shown in Fig. 6(a), 12 to Nov = 2 (overlap of two cube corners),

20

6 to Nov = 4 (overlap of two faces), and 1 to Nov = 8 (full overlap). Setting x = €/T this leads to a second virial

V2(x)=8×(1-exp(-x/8))

+ 12 × (1 - exp(-x/4))

+ 6× (1 - exp(-x/2))

+ 1 x (1 - exp(-x))

(89) Table 2 BFM solutions with overlap penalty ¿ = 10 for different vol- ume fractions ø = 8p. The indicated dynamical properties - accep- tance rate A, local mobility W and self-diffusion constant DN - have been obtained using local L26-moves for chains of length N = 1024.

given in units of the lattice cube volume 63. We note that the second virial becomes constant, v2 = 27, for large x » 1 as expected [127]. This second virial coefficient is about half the effective bulk modulus v ~ 66 indicated above. In the opposite limit we have

V2(x)~8x- 16 27 x- for x << 1.

(90)

We shall see in Sec. 4.4 that v2 ~ v in this limit.

## 3.4.3 Implementation



Since a lattice site may be occupied now by more than one monomer, it is not possible to use a compact boolean oc- cupation lattice as for the classical BFM. Instead we have mapped Eq. (88) onto a Potts spin model [26]

2

(91)

δ ≥S(r) ≥J(S)S(r+d) -- Enmon 1 r

E = 1

with constant monomer number nmon = >, S(r) = L3p. We use the Wigner-Seitz representation of the BFM on the cubic lattice [134,30] where an integer spin variable S(r) counts the number of BFM monomers (S = 0, 1,2, ... ) with cubes centered at a Wigner-Seitz lattice position r. Since we have now to compute the interaction between cube centers instead of cube corners, the coupling constant J characterizing the interaction between two spins depends only on the relative distance 8:

- 1/8 if & = P(1, 1, 1) for cube corners, 1/4 if & = P(1, 1,0) for cube edges,

J (δ) = 8 1/2 if S =P(1,0,0) for cube faces,

(92)

1

1 if & = P(0,0, 0) for full overlap,

0 otherwise.

Since the interaction is still short-ranged and the values of J are readily tabulated, this remains an efficient rendering of the monomer interactions. Note that the first term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (91) contains a constant self-interaction contri- bution of the nmon monomers with themselves for & = 0, which is subtracted by the second term.48

48 Attractive interactions similar to the ones used in [134, 135, 136, 137] may be easily added to the Potts spin formulation of the soft BFM. The simulation of polymer blends requires additional Potts spin lattices as the two lattices used to obtain the chemical potential in Sec. 4.5.

## 3.4.4 Equilibration and system properties



As start configurations we have used the equilibrated BFM configurations without monomer overlap (€ = 0) described in Sec. 3.2 [84]. As one may expect, the configurational properties are found essentially unchanged for x >> 5 (Ta- ble 1). Local L26-moves need to be added to the snake moves for x ≥ 1. Otherwise the slithering snake motion will be- come ineffective [49]. Simple slithering snakes without lo- cal moves are sufficient, however, for smaller penalties. We have crosschecked our results in this regime for N = 2048 and N = 8192 using boxes of linear size L = 512 by starting our simulations with Gaussian chains at x = 0 and increas- ing then the penalty. Table 1 present some system properties obtained for our reference volume fraction ø = 0.5 such as dimensionless compressibility g or the effective bond length b. Averages are performed over all chains and at least 100 configurations. The chain lengths N = 64, N = 1024 and N = 2048 have been studied with particular care. Density effects have been studied more briefly. As will be discussed in Sec. 4.2, we have sampled weak overlap penalties (x << 1) for N = 8192 to investigate the intrachain contributions to the mean energy. We have also probed various densities for N = 1024 and E = 10 as summarized in Table 2. This was done to check for density effects on the deviations to Rouse dynamics as discussed in Sec. 6.4.

## 3.5 BFM with annealed mass distribution



## 3.5.1 Motivation and context



As discussed above (Fig. 7), the equilibration and sampling of strictly monodisperse polymer melts is a delicate issue. An elegant way to test the computed conformational proper- ties is given by associating a finite "scission energy" E ≥ 0 to each bond which has to be paid if a bond is broken [17, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 154]. Since we are only interested here in linear polymer melts, the formation of closed cycles and the branching of the chains is not permitted.49 As sketched in Fig. 9, we relax thus the constraint that bonds can never break, i.e. that the connectivity matrix (defining which monomers are connected by BFM bonds) is quenched, and allow the

49 In systems of experimental relevance closed cycles are suppressed by the non-negligible rigidity of the chains [158, 159, 160].

Fig. 9 Self-assembled linear EP: (a) Bead-spring representation of a worm-like micelle assuming a finite scission energy E and a fi- nite barrier height B [17]. The scission energy determines the static properties and fixes the ratio of the scission and recombination rates, ks ~ exp(-(E +B)/kBT) and k, ~ exp(-B/kBT). Both energy scales are sketched vs. a generic reaction coordinate q [117]. The formation of closed rings and the branching of chains are not allowed in the pre- sented studies. (b) Two-dimensional projection of EP modeled using the classical BFM without monomer overlap [107]. Chains consists of symmetrically connected lists of bonds. The pointers of end-bonds point to NIL. The breaking of a saturated bond ibond requires to set the pointers of the two connected bonds ibond and jbond = pointer(ibond) to NIL. Setting pointer(-2)=4 and pointer(4) =- 2 connects the two end- monomers imon=2 and jmon=4.

polymerization of the chains and their respective monomers to take place under condition of chemical equilibrium. Such systems of self-assembled EP are not only useful for com- putational purposes but are also of high experimental rele- vance.50 An important example sketched in Fig. 9(a) is that of some surfactant molecules forming long giant worm-like micelles which break and recombine constantly at random points along the sequence [17,20]. Similar systems of EP are formed by liquid sulfur [102, 103], selenium [104] and some protein filaments [9]. Although with respect to their static properties EP behave very much like quenched polymers, the constant reorganization of the chain connectivity offers an additional relaxation pathway reducing strongly the re- laxation times [17,104, 108, 109]. Obviously, EP are intrin- sically polydisperse with an annealed length distribution pN minimizing the free energy of the system (Sec. 2.2). Since both the bonding energy per chain -E(N - 1) and all other free energy contributions to the chain chemical potential UN are extensive with repect to the chain length N - at least ac- cording to Flory's ideality hypothesis - one expects a Flory distribution decreasing exponentially with chain length N.

50 In the surfactant literature [17] EP are often referred to as "liv- ing polymers" (LP) although this is potentially confusing since they are distinct from systems that polymerize stepwise, in the presence of a fixed number of initiators, for which this term has previously been reserved [161]. Since LP are held together by strong covalent carbon- to-carbon bonds, they do not break in the middle of the polymer chain.

## 3.5.2 Spatial monomer moves



The EP systems presented in this study have been obtained with the classical BFM algorithm without monomer over- lap (¿ = 0, T = 1) at the standard melt volume fraction ¢ = 8p = 0.5. Using again the Wigner-Seitz representation we mark (only) the index of each monomer on the peri- odic lattice of linear size L = 256. Thus the indices of the monomers in the neighborhood of a reference monomer are readily obtained which is helpful for the recombination of bonds described below. Only local L06 or L26 monomer moves have been used since the breaking and recombina- tion of the chains reduce the relaxation times dramatically compared to monodisperse systems [109]. Additional global MC moves as described in Sec. 3.3 may be added, however, in future studies.

## 3.5.3 Connectivity pointer list



Self-assembled EP are only transient objects and it is thus inefficient to base the data structure on the chains [105], rather it should be based on the (saturated or unsaturated) bonds of each monomer [107]. As sketched in Fig. 9(b), this allows via a linear pointer list between the bonds to avoid all sorting procedures. Using the assumption that no branch- ing of chains is allowed, the two (possible) bonds of each monomer imon are called ibond = imon and ibond = - imon. No specific meaning (or direction) is attached to the sign: this is merely a convenience for finding the monomer from the bond list: imon = |ibond|. Pointers are taken to couple independently of sign and the bonds are coupled by means of a pointer list in a completely transitive fashion. Only two simple operations are thus required for breaking or recom- bining bonds. Unsaturated bonds at chain ends point to NIL. Only these bonds may recombine. A minor caveat attached to this data structure arises if the ends of a given chain are not allowed to bind together as in the presented studies. Since there is no direct chain information in the data structure we have to check this constraint before every recombination by working up the pointer list which only adds four lines to the source code.51

## 3.5.4 Connectivity altering moves



As sketched in Fig. 9(a), EP systems are not only character- ized by the monomer density p and the finite scission en- ergy E which determine the static properties but also by a barrier height B > 0 which only influences the scission and recombination rates. This barrier is taken into account by setting an attempt frequency @B = exp(-B/T) for choosing randomly one bond ibond out of the 2nmon bonds of the sys- tem. This frequency is a convenient tool for testing the dy- namics of EP at different lifetimes of the chains [108, 109, 162] although for the static properties discussed the choice

51 For higher E the simulation becomes actually faster per MCS since the number of recombinations goes down like the squared density of unsaturated end monomers (p/ (N)2 ~ exp(-E) [10].

Table 3 Various properties of EP obtained by means of the 3D BFM algorithm without monomer overlap (€ = 0) at volume fraction ø = 8p = 0.5: imposed scission energy E, the mean chain length (N), the ratio F(0) = (N2) / (N) comparing the first and the second moment of the number distribution, the root-mean-squared bond length l, the z- averaged end-to-end distance Re,z and radius of gyration Rg,z obtained using Eq. (19) with p = 2. For all scission energies we have used pe- riodic simulation boxes of linear size L = 256 containing nmon = 220 monomers.

of B is irrelevant. The bond ibond corresponds to a monomer imon = |ibond| at a position r. Depending on whether the bond ibond is saturated or unsaturated we try to break it or to connect it to a suitable nearby unsaturated monomer. A delicate detailed balance problem arises [109] if nu > 1 un- saturated monomers are available for recombination (the no- closed-cycle condition having been verified). If one chooses now one of these monomers at random, a weight 1/nu has to be taken into account for the reverse breaking process. Choosing in addition to the reference bond ibond a trial bond vector Į allows to avoid these weights. If ibond is unsatu- rated one searches for an unsaturated monomer only at the position r + Z (taking into account the periodicity of the lat- tice). Since monomer overlap is forbidden there is at most one unsaturated monomer at this position. If this is case and if no closed cycle is formed, the recombination is accepted since the energy change is -E ≤ 0. To satisfy detailed bal- ance a saturated bond can therefore only be broken if its bond vector is identical to the trial bond l. Applying the Metropolis algorithm [26] a scission is performed whenever the value of a random number between 0 and 1 is smaller than exp(-E/T). The fact that we only probe one lattice vector ¿ for possible recombinations and not all possible 108 obviously strongly reduces the number of recombination and scission events. However, since we are interested in uncor- related changes of the connectivity list, a broken monomer must anyway move over a certain distance, say 10, before a new recombination attempt is made. Otherwise there is a strong chance that the newly created chain end monomer re- combines with its previous partner [108, 109, 162].

## 3.5.5 Some computational results



As summarized in Table 3, we have sampled EP systems with scission energies up to E = 15, the largest energy cor- responding to a mean chain length (N) ~ 6183. As for the athermal classical monodisperse BFM systems we obtain a dimensionless compressibility g = 0.24, an effective bond length b = 3.244 and a swelling coefficient cs = 0.41. As discussed in Sec. 2.2.2 one expects EP melts to be Flory distributed [Eq. (20)] if the chemical potential of the chains is extensive with respect to their mass, UN ~ N. The main panel of Fig. 10 presents the normalized length distribution PN for different scission energies E as indicated. A nice data collapse is apparently obtained if PN (N) is plotted as a function of the reduced chain length x = N/ (N) using the measured mean chain length (N). At first sight, there is no sign of deviation from the exponential decay indicated by the solid line. The mean chain length itself is given in panel (b) as a function of E together with some higher moments (NP) = EN NP PN of the distribution. As indicated by the dashed line, we find (NP) ~ exp(pE/2) as expected from Eq. (23) [17, 107]. The data presented in the first two panels of Fig. 10 is thus fully consistent with older computational work [105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111] which has let us to believe (incorrectly) that Flory's ideality hypothesis must hold rigorously. Closer inspection of the histograms reveals, however, deviations for small x << 1. As can be seen from panel (c), the probability for short chains is reduced with re- spect to the Flory distribution (solid line). We shall further investigate this depletion in Sec. 4.6.

We note finally that all EP systems presented here have been sampled within 4 months while the sample of monodis- perse configurations for N = 8192 alone required about 3

## 4 Thermodynamic properties of BFM melts



## 4.1 Introduction



To characterize the soft BFM model introduced in Sec. 3.4 we will first investigate thermodynamic properties such as the mean overlap energy per monomer e, the specific heat cv, the dimensionless compressibility g or the excess chain chemical potential UN as functions of the reduced overlap strength x = €/T = εβ. For the small-x limit these proper- ties have been calculated long ago by Edwards [4] as sum- marized in Eq. (69). Various thermodynamic properties ob- tained from the quoted free energy will be compared with our numerical results [86]. To demonstrate that deviations from Flory's ideality hypothesis are also present in thermo- dynamic properties we will investigate in detail in Sec. 4.6 the chemical potential in systems of annealed EP using the classical BFM algorithm without monomer overlap.

## 4.2 Mean overlap energy



From the numerical point of view the simplest thermody- namic property to be investigated here is the mean interac- tion energy per monomer, e = (E) /nmon, due to the Hamil- tonian, Eq. (88). Fig. 11 presents the dimensionless energy

Fig. 12 Reduced mean energy e/E (spheres) and self-energy eself/E (triangles) as functions of the number density p for N = 8192, L = 512 and x = 0.001. As shown by the dashed line, e(p) is a superposition of the mean field energy 4p and the (essentially) constant self-energy @self/E ~0.18Nºxº pº. Inset: e/E - 4p as a function of chain length 1/VN - 1 for our reference density p = 0.5/8 and for a single chain (p = 0). The linear slope (bold line) is expected from the return prob- ability of Gaussian chains.

y = e/E for BFM melts (Ø = 0.5) for different chain length N. Decreasing the overlap strength x starting from config- urations obtained using the classical BFM (Sec. 3.3), the interaction energy increases first exponentially for large x and levels off for x « 1 where the monomers freely over- lap. The data for unconnected beads (N = 1) represented by the filled spheres and polymer chains (N >> 1) are broadly speaking similar, especially for large overlap penalties, x > 1. Interestingly, the mean energy of polymer melts increases more strongly for x « 1 as can be seen better from the log- linear data representation chosen in the inset of Fig. 11. Also shown in the inset is the mean intrachain self-energy per monomer e self (filled triangles) obtained for the largest chain length available for a given x. In fact about half of the energy of polymer melts for all x is due to the self-interactions of the chains [86]. For x << 1 the self-energy becomes eself/8 ~ 0.18 which is exactly the observed energy difference be- tween polymer and bead systems.

Before addressing this point let us consider the energy of soft BFM beads (N = 1) for which the second virial coeffi- cient v2(x) has been given in Eq. (89). Since e = dB (Bf(B)) the mean energy becomes to leading order [163]

corresponding to the first term in the third line of Eq. (69). Eq. (93) is represented by the dashed line in Fig. 11. It cor- responds to an Arrhenius behavior with y ~ pexp(-x/8)/2 for x > 1 (dash-dotted line) and to y > 18p = 4p for x < 1. This simple formula predicts well the bead data over the en- tire range of x and also yields a remarkable fit for polymer chains with larger overlap penalties.

24

The energy difference between polymer chains and beads for x « 1 is accounted for by the first free energy contribu- tion indicated in Eq. (69). This contribution is further inves- tigated in Fig. 12 presenting data for such small x that the entropy dominates all conformational properties. The self- energy of a chain is thus given by the probability p(s, 8) that a random walk of s BFM bonds returns to a relative position & with respect to a reference monomer at r. Hence,

₫ s=2

(94)

where the first sum runs over all positions with non-vanish- ing coupling constant J(8) as defined in Eq. (92). The proba- bility p(s, S) and the weights J(S)p(s,S) can be tabulated in principle for small s. Since the return probability decreases strongly with s, these model-specific small-s values dom- inate the integral, Eq. (94). As can be seen from the in- set of Fig. 12 for single chains (p = 0), eself ~0.18E for large N. The weak N-dependence visible in the panel stems from the upper integration boundary over the Gaussian re- turn probability which leads to a chain length correction lin- ear in t = 1/VN -1 (bold line). Also shown in the panel are energies for our reference density p = 0.5/8. They are shifted vertically by the mean field energy 4p assuming that density fluctuations of different chains do not couple. The main panel presents the mean energy e and the mean self- energy eself as functions of the density p for chains of length N = 8192. The self-energy (triangles) stays essentially p- independent. The total interaction energy sums over the self- energy and mean-field energy contributions as shown by the dashed line. The self-energy contribution can only be ne- glected for volume fractions larger than unity.

Summarizing Eqs. (69) and (90) the energy should scale to leading order in x as

where the two x-independent contributions have already been discussed above. The underlined term stems from the den- sity fluctuation contribution in Eq. (69). Eq. (95) is indicated by the bold line in the inset of Fig. 11. It yields a reasonable description for small x. Since the energy is dominated by the two constant contributions to Eq. (95) for x ≤ 0.001 and since higher expansion terms become relevant for x > 0.1, the predicted Vx-decay corresponds unfortunately only to the small-x regime. To show that it is indeed the density fluc- tuation term which dominates the temperature dependence for x « 1 we will consider now the specific heat cv, i.e. the second derivative of the free energy with respect to B.

Fig. 13 Specific heat per bead cy vs. x. The dashed line indicates the energy fluctuations predicted from the second virial, Eq. (96), which fits the data of soft BFM beads (N = 1) over six decades. While the chain length does not matter for strong excluded volume interac- tions, the energy fluctuations are found to increase strongly with N for x « 1. For short chains we observe cv ~ pN1/2x2 as can be seen for N = 16 (thin solid line). The chain length effect drops out for large N where cy ~ p1/2,3/2Nº (bold line) as suggested by Eq. (97). Inset: cv/(p1/2×3/2) as a function of the reduced chain length u = N/g(x).

heat per monomer, cv = - B2%(Bf(B)) [163]. Using the second virial of soft BFM beads, Eq. (89), one obtains

cv =2 (ge-x18 +2=/4+2=/2+e=x)

(96)

as represented by the dashed line. In the large-x limit this yields an exponential decay cv ~ px2 exp(-x/8)/16 (dash- dotted line) while for x << 1 a power-law limiting behavior is obtained: cv~ gpx2 ~x2. Eq. (96) predicts the energy fluc- tuations of BFM beads for essentially all x, slightly underes- timating the maximum of cy at x ~10. Chain length effects are small for large x where Eq. (96) can be used to fit the spe- cific heats of polymer melts. Strong N-effects are, however, visible for x << 1 where cy increases monotonously with N. This can better be seen from the inset where the specific heat is plotted as a function of the reduced chain length u = N / g with g being the dimensionless compressibility determined in Sec. 4.4.52 For large chains with u >> 1 this increase levels off at an N-independent envelope

cv = 24V 241/6 p1/2 13 x-3/2 Nº + ...

(97)

due to the density fluctuation contribution in Eq. (69). In contrast to Eq. (95) for the mean energy the density fluctua- tion term does now correspond to the leading contribution to the numerically measured property. This increases the range where the density fluctuation contribution can be demon- strated to over three decades in x. Eq. (97) is indicated by the bold lines in the main panel and the inset of Fig. 13.

52 Since e and cy correspond to different derivatives of the free en- ergy f with respect to B, there is obviously no inconsistency in the finding that cy reveals larger chain length effects than e.

Fig. 14 Dimensionless compressibility gN(x) = lima-> S(q, N) vs. x for different N using the same symbols as in Fig. 13. Main panel: Raw data as obtained from the low-wavevector limit of the structure factor. Chain length effects become irrelevant for x ≥ 0.1 if N ≥ 64 and for x>0.001 if N ≥ 2048. The data are compared to the simple second virial approximation 1/v2(x)p (dashed line) which reduces to 1/(8xp) for x « 1. As one expects, the compressibility levels off for large x and becomes identical to the value g ~0.25, known for the classical BFM [84] (dash-dotted line). Inset: As suggested by Eq. (98) the ex- cess part of the inverse compressibility 1/gN(x) - 1/N becomes chain length independent, i.e. the data points for all N collapse. The bold line indicates g(x) = limN > 8N(x) from Table 1.

## 4.4 Compressibility



The key control property characterizing the decree of cou- pling of the polymer chains due to the imposed penalty & is the dimensionless compressibility g(x) = limN >> 8N(x) of asymptotically long chains. As suggested by Eq. (43), we compute first the dimensionless compressibility gN (x) = limq->0 S(q,N) from the low-q limit of the total monomer structure factor for different overlap penalties x and chain lengths N (see below for details). These raw data are pre- sented in Fig. 14 as a function of x. As one expects, gN (x) decreases monotonously with x. Note that the structure fac- tor S(q,t) measures the complete compressibility, not just its excess contribution. As can be seen, e.g., from Eq. (69) or from the virial expansion of polymer solutions [3], the compressibility can be written in general as

1 =p gN (x) 2p2 22(Bf(B)p) =

1 + 1

N gex (x,N)

(98)

for all x with gex (x, N) being the excess contribution to the compressibility which may, at least in principle, depend on N.53 As can be seen from the inset of Fig. 14, all rescaled compressibilities collapse, however, on one N-independent master curve if one plots 1/gex (x,N) = 1/gN(x) -1/N as a function of x, even the compressibilities obtained for un- connected beads (N = 1). Within numerical accuracy the N- dependence observed for gN(x) can therefore be attributed to the trivial osmotic contribution and the excess compress- ibility gex ~ Nº is thus identical to the compressibility g(x)

53 Small corrections may arise as they do arise for the chemical po- tential as shown below in Sec. 4.6.

Fig. 15 Total structure factor S(q) as a function of wavevector q for N = 2048 for different overlap penalties x = /T as indicated. For comparison, we have also included the single chain form factor F (q) for x = 0.001. The low-wavevector limit of the structure factor is used to determine the dimensionless compressibility gN(x). Only for x ≤ 3 does the structure factor decay monotonously with q as suggested by the RPA formula, Eq. (100). G(q) becomes essentially constant for smaller temperatures except for wavevectors corresponding to the first sharp diffraction peak. The box size L = 256 allows only a direct and fair determination of gN (x) for x > 0.1. We have been forced to increase the box size to L = 512 for smaller x as may be seen for an example with x = 0.1 (dash-dotted line). As shown by the bold dashed line, the RPA formula is used to improve the estimation of gN (x) for small x.

of asymptotically long chains. The bold line indicated in the inset presents the best values of g(x) summarized in Table 1. These values have been obtained from the excess compress- ibilities for the largest chain length available for x ≥ 0.001. A precise numerical determination of gex (x) becomes impossi- ble for even smaller overlap penalties. We thus have used for the smallest x-values sampled the theoretical prediction

for x « 1 due to the postulated free energy, Eq. (69). The prefactor v2(x)p representing the bare monomer interaction is indicated by the dashed line in the main panel of Fig. 14. Hence, g(x)~1/(8xp) = 2/x for weak interactions. The un- derlined term is the leading correction due to the density fluctuation contribution to the free energy. It implies that the excess compressibilities for polymer melts and unconnected beads cannot be completely identical. However, the differ- ence is far too small to be measurable in the limit where Eq. (99) applies. Although this result is unfortunate from the theoretical point of view, the data collapse observed in the inset suggests that it is acceptable to numerically esti- mate the long chain compressibility g(x) by computing the structure factors of rather short chains.

We now turn to the total structure factor S(q,N) shown in Fig. 15 to explain how the compressibilities have been ob- tained. Only chains of length N = 2048 are presented for clarity. Since the wavevectors q used for computing S(q) must be commensurate with the cubic simulation box of linear dimension L, i.e. the smallest possible wavevector is

Q=qğ with §2=b2g/12

Fig. 16 Rescaled total structure factor S(q)/g(x) as a function of the reduced wavevector Q = q§ for chain length N = 8192 and several x ≤ 1 as indicated. The screening length § of the thermal blob is ob- tained according to Eq. (44) using g(x) and b(x) from Table 1. The bold line compares the data with Eq. (101). If replotted as indicated in the inset the data collapse on the bisection line. Deviations from the RPA formula become visible for larger x as shown for x = 1 (crosses).

2n/L, it thus is important to have a sufficiently large box for a reasonable determination of gN(x). Note that around and above q ~2 monomer structure and lattice effects be- come important. Being interested in universal physical be- havior we focus on wavevectors q << 1. For comparison, we have also included the single chain form factor F (q) for x = 0.001 (bold line). Note that the qualitative shape of F(q) - decaying monotonously with q from its maximum value F(q=0,N) = N - depends very little on the overlap penalty x (not shown). We remind that the "random phase approximation" (RPA) formula [3,4]

(100)

## S(q,N) F(q,N) + gex (x,N)



relates the total structure factor to the measured form fac- tor. Eq. (100) is of course consistent with Eq. (98) in the q -> 0 limit. It allows to directly fit for the excess compress- ibility gex(x, N) ~ g(x) using the measured structure factor S(q,N) and form factor F(q,N), at least in the x-range where the RPA approximation applies. As may be seen from the figure, S(q,N) indeed decreases systematically with x, i.e. with decreasing g(x). For x ≤ 3 it also decays monotonously with q, again in agreement with Eq. (100). Interestingly, this becomes qualitatively different for larger excluded volume interactions (x > 3) where the total structure factor is es- sentially constant (in double-logarithmic coordinates), very weakly increasing monotonously with q. The RPA formula apparently does not apply in this limit in agreement with Eq. (48). Fortunately, this is of no concern for our main purpose - to compute g(x) - since in precisely this limit the compressibility is readily obtained from a broad plateau (even for much smaller boxes) which in addition becomes chain length independent, as we have already seen from the inset of Fiq. (14). Using boxes with L = 256 it is possi- ble to directly measure the plateau values for x ≤ 0.3. For smaller x we have simulated boxes with L = 512 containing nmon ~ 8.4 . 106 monomers and corresponding to a smallest

wavevector q ~ 0.01. This box size becomes again insuffi- cient for the smallest reduced overlap penalties x we have simulated, as shown in Fig. 15 for x = 0.001 (dashed line). It is for these values where the RPA formula, Eq. (100), al- lowing to fit the deviation from the (barely visible) plateau, has been particulary useful.

As already stated in Sec. 2.3, for intermediate wavevec- tors (where q corresponds to distances much smaller than the radius of gyration and much larger than the monomer size) the general RPA Eq. (100) may be rewritten as

(101)

1 S(9) 8(x)+=a2(x)92 == ( (1+(95)2)

where we have used that the form factor becomes F(q) ~ 2/(aq)2 [4]. This assumes that corrections to Gaussian chain statistics may be ignored [82,83] and that finite chain size effects are negligible. From the numerical point of view the approximated RPA Eq. (101) has the disadvantage that the effective bond length b(x) = v6a(x) needs to be determined first. As shown in Fig. 16, it has the advantage that it al- lows for an additional test of the values of g(x) and b(x) indicated in Table 1. The main panel presents the rescaled structure factor S(q)/g(x) for chains of length N = 8192 as a function of Q = q§ with § being obtained from g(x) using Eq. (44). All data collapse on the master curve 1/(1+ Q2) indicated by the bold line provided that the wavevector q re- mains sufficiently small and no local physics is probed. That the used compressibilities are accurate is emphasized further in the inset where g(x)/S(q) - 1 is plotted as a function of Q2 using only sufficiently small wavevectors q. According to Eq. (101) all data should collapse on the bisection line in double-logarithmic coordinates if the correct compressibili- ties are used. This is indeed the case. Please note the weak deviations visible for x = 1 which is due to the breakdown of the RPA formula for large x mentioned above.

## 4.5 Chemical potential: Gaussian contribution



According to Flory's ideality hypothesis the chemical po- tential UN of polymer melts is expected to be extensive with respect to their mass [3]. Fig. 17 presents the reduced ex- cess contribution to the chemical potential, y = UN/TN, ob- tained using thermodynamic integration (as explained be- low) for three chain lengths N = 1, 64, and 2048 as func- tions of x = €/T. As one expects, y(x) increases first linearly with x and then levels off. Chain length effects are again small on the logarithmic scale chosen in the plot. For large x the chemical potential becomes slightly larger for beads (y ~2.64) than for long chains where y ~ 2.1 as shown by the dash-dotted line. That the chemical potential of poly- mer chains is reduced compared to unconnected beads is expected due to the (effectively) attractive bond potential. For x « 1 this reduction should be described by the density fluctuation contribution to the free energy [Eq. (69)] which corresponds to an excess chemical potential

Fig. 17 Reduced chemical potential y = UN/TN measuring the re- versible work for bringing a test chain of length N into a bath of chains of equal length N at volume fraction Ø = 0.5. Increasing linearly (dashed line) for small x it levels off for large x » 1 (dash-dotted line). The dashed line shows the second virial approximation y ~ v2(x)p for unconnected beads, fitting successfully the data below x ~ 1. The bold line indicates Eq. (102). Inset: The chemical potential has been ob- tained by thermodynamic integration over the excluded volume inter- action of an inserted ghost chain [129].

which has to be paid for a complete overlap of two system monomers or two ghost monomers. The interaction of both spins is described by

(104)

r δ with coupling constants Jsg(8) ~ Esg defined as in Eq. (92) taken apart the energy parameter & which is replaced by the tunable interaction energy Esg. Starting with decoupled sys- tem and ghost configurations at Esg = 0, i.e. A = 1, we in- crease the interaction parameter up to Esg = E, i.e. ^(E) = exp( -¿ ß /8), always keeping the coupled system at equilib- rium. Monitoring the distribution of the number Nsg of over- laps between system and ghost cube corners we use multi- histogram methods as described in [129, 130] to improve the precision of the integral. The mean overlap number (Nsg > is shown in the inset of Fig. 17 as a function of A for N = 2048 and two inverse temperatures x = 3 and x = 100. Starting from A = 1 the overlap number decreases monotonously with increasing coupling between system and ghost mono- mers. Interestingly, a power-law behavior

## (Nsg / N = 2 1/ 4



(105) is found empirically for large x >> 10 (dashed line). Fitting this power law and integrating then analytically Eq. (103) provides a useful crosscheck of the numerical integration using the multihistogram analysis. This is a technically im- portant finding, since the multihistogram analysis requires overlapping distributions of Nsg and hence much more equi- librated intermediate values À as indicated for x = 100.

for x « 1 with v2(x) being the second virial of unconnected beads. The dashed line in Fig. 17 presents the leading con- tribution v2(x)p for unconnected beads, the bold line in ad- dition the underlined connectivity contribution in Eq. (102). Surprisingly, it turns out that the simple second virial ap- proximation provides a better fit over the entire x-range than the full prediction. That the density fluctuation contribution overestimates the reduction of the chemical potential for x > 1 is in agreement with Eq. (48). For x « 1 where Eq. (102) applies in principle the relative correction, scaling as Vx/p, becomes unfortunately too small to allow a fair test of the theory using the measured chemical potential.

We now explain how the chemical potential presented in Fig. 17 has been obtained. Obviously, the simple insertion method due to Widom [24] becomes rapidly inefficient with increasing x. Generalizing the method suggested in [129, 130] we have performed the thermodynamic integration [24]

The spin lattices are kept at the same tempera- ture T and are both characterized by the same penalty € = 1

## 4.6 Chemical potential: Non-extensive corrections



## 4.6.1 Theoretical predictions



We have seen in Sec. 4.5 that the chemical potential UN of a test chain of length N plugged into a melt of chemi- cally identical monodisperse polymers of the same length increases essentially linearly with N. Focusing now on clas- sical BFM systems where E = c and setting temperature to unity (T = 1), we show how small non-linear deviations may be captured numerically [88]. More generally, the challenge is to characterize the chemical potential Un of a test chain of length n immersed into a bath of N-chains of an arbitrary (normalized) length distribution pN. We remind that accord- ing to Flory's ideality hypothesis one expects [3],

## Un = un for g < n « (N)2,



(106)

with u > O being the effective chemical potential per mono- mer. The upper boundary (N)2 indicated in Eq. (106) is due to the well-known swelling of extremely large test chains where the bath acts as a good solution [3,7]. As we have pointed out in Sec. 1.5, Flory's hypothesis has been chal- lenged by the discovery of long-range correlations imposed by the incompressibility constraint. These correlations lead to the systematic swelling of chain segments as further dis- cussed in Sec. 5 [80,86]. We question here the validity of

Fig. 18 Non-extensive deviation of the chemical potential 8 un/cu as a function of the test chain length n as predicted by perturbation calcula- tion [88]. The reference for the chemical potential un is set here by the chemical potential of Gaussian chains of same effective bond length b. Flory-distributed (FD) melts are indicated by solid lines, monodis- perse (MD) melts by dash-dotted lines (Padé approximation). The bold lines refer to test chains in melts of constant (mean) chain length with (N) = 100. The deviation changes sign at n ~ (N). The thinner lines refer to test chains of same length as the typical melt chain, n = (N), where the asymptotic Gaussian behavior (δμη = 0) is approached sys- tematically from below.

Flory's hypothesis for an important thermodynamic prop- erty, the chemical potential Un of a test chain inserted into a three-dimensional melt. One expects that the correlation hole potential (Fig. 3) leads to a deviation

δμη = μη - μη ~u* (n)~+1/vn for n < (Ν) (107)

that is non-extensive in chain length and this irrespective of the distribution pN of the bath. Assuming a quenched Flory- size distribution, Eq. (20), it can be demonstrated as shown in Appendix B.6 that

ôun~(1-2un) for g <n < (N)2 (108)

where we have set cu = 3cs/8 using the swelling coefficient Cs= \24/ 13 / pb3 defined in the Sec. 1.5. Eq. (108) is rep- resented by the bold solid line in Fig. 18. (A corresponding prediction for a monodisperse bath [88] is indicated by the dash-dotted line.) As anticipated by Eq. (107), the first term in Eq. (108) dominates for short test chains. The second term dominates for large test chains with n > 1/(2u) becoming non-perturbative for n >> 1/u2. Both contributions to 8un decrease with increasing n.54 Interestingly, while 8 un de- creases at fixed (N), it increases as 8un/cu = - 1/ yn (thin solid line) for a test chain with n = (N). The chemical po- tential of typical chains of the bath approaches thus the ideal chain limit from below.

Flory-distributed polymer melts are obtained naturally in systems of self-assembled linear EP where branching and

54 This corresponds to an effective enhancement factor of the parti- tion function quite similar to the 8un = - (y -1) log(n) in the standard excluded volume statistics with y ~ 1.16 > 1 being the self-avoiding walk susceptibility exponent [3].

the formation of closed rings are forbidden [17]. Since the suggested correction, Eq. (108), to the ideal chain chemical potential is weak, the system must remain to leading order Flory distributed and Eq. (108) should thus hold.55 This cor- rection implies for the annealed length distribution of linear EP that (to leading order)

PN ~ με ΗΝ-δμη

(109)

~ Me-MN (1- VN Cu (1-2uN) (110)

where both the lower (g << N) and the upper limit (N << (N)2) of validity are irrelevant in the large-(N) limit. Note that Eq. (110) is properly normalized, i.e. the prefactor u of the distribution remains exact if 8 UN is given by Eq. (108). At given u the first moment increases slightly

## (N) = u-1(1+cuv/UT).



(111)

and, more generally, one expects for the pth moment

p! p! [2](p+3/2)-I(p+1/2)] (112) UP (NP) 2-1=9 CuVM

with I (x) being the Gamma function [44]. The non-expo- nentiality parameter Lp = 1 - (NP) /p! (N)P thus scales as

## Lp = WpCuyu with



Wp=(T(p+1/2)+xpp !- 21(p+3/2))/p! (113)

being a p-dependent geometrical factor.56

## 4.6.2 Computational results for EP melts



Eq. (110) and Eq. (113) allow us to demonstrate numeri- cally the prediction, Eq. (108), from the observed non-ex- ponentiality of the length distribution of EP melts obtained as described in Sec. 3.5. As demonstrated in the main panel of Fig. 10 these EP melts are indeed essentially Flory dis- tributed, i.e. the length distribution pN decays to leading order exponentially with the reduced chain length N / (N). However, deviations for N/ (N) « 1 are visible in Fig. 10(c) in qualitative agreement with the predicted positive devi- ation of the chemical potential, Eq. (107). The curvature of - log(PN) is further analyzed in Fig. 19. Motivated by Eq. (109), we present in panel (a) the functional

## V [PN] = - log(PN) - UN +log(u) (114)



55 The chemical potential of a test chain does depend on the length distribution PN of the bath. However, for an infinite macroscopically homogeneous systems it is independent on whether this distribution is annealed or quenched, i.e. if it is allowed to fluctuate or not. This fol- lows from the well-known behavior of fluctuations of extensive param- eters in macroscopic systems: the relative fluctuations vanish as 1/ VV as the total volume V -> 00. The latter limit is taken first in our calcu- lations, i.e. we consider an infinite number of (annealed or quenched) chains. The large-N limit is then taken afterwards.

56 The polydispersity index I, i.e. the ratio of weight average and number average, becomes I = (N2)/(N)2 =2(1-w2Cup) < 2. In this sense, the distribution becomes narrower just as for dilute good solvent EP where I = 1+1/? < 2 [107, 164].

Fig. 19 Characterization of pN using the functionals (a) V[PN] ~ 8 UN and (b) W[PN] = 2V[PN] - V[P2N] which should both vanish for per- fectly Flory-distributed ideal chains as indicated by the horizontal lines in the panels. Data points for different scission energies E collapse if V[PN]/cu VM and W[PN]/cu VM(2-1/2) are plotted vs. the reduced chain length x = uN. For small x both functionals decay as 1/ Vx as shown by the dash-dotted lines. The bold lines correspond to the full predictions Eq. (116) and Eq. (118) for V[PN] and W [PN], respectively.

where the second term takes off the ideal contribution to the chemical potential. The last term is due to the normalization of pN and eliminates a trivial vertical shift depending on the scission energy E. Consistently with Eq. (111), the chemical potential per monomer u has been obtained from the mea- sured mean chain length (N) using

u =(N)-1 (1+CuVTT/ VIN).

(115)

Note that u and 1/ (N) become numerically indistinguish- able for E > 7. If the Gaussian contribution to the chemical potential is properly subtracted one expects to obtain directly the non-Gaussian deviation to the chemical potential, 8 UN ~ V[PN]. Due to Eq. (108) the functional should thus scale as V[PN]/CuVū~ (1-2x)/ Vx (116)

with x = uN as indicated by the bold line in the panel. This is well born out by the data collapse obtained up to x ~ 5. Ob- viously, the statistics deteriorates for x » 1 for all energies due to the exponential cutoff of pN. Unfortunately, the statis- tics of the length histograms decreases strongly with E and becomes too low for a meaningful comparison for E > 9. It is for this numerical reason that we use Eq. (115) rather than the large-E limit u = 1/ (N) since this allows us to add the two histograms for E = 5 and E = 6 for which high preci- sion data is available. Otherwise these energies would devi- ate from Eq. (116) for large x due to an insufficient subtrac- tion of the leading Gaussian contribution.

Since the subtraction of the large linear Gaussian contri- bution is in any case a delicate issue we present in panel (b) of Fig. 19 a second functional,

Fig. 20 Non-exponentiality parameter Lp for different moments p as a function of mean chain length (N). Lp is finite decreasing with chain length as suggested by Eq. (113). The vertical axis has been rescaled successfully using the p-dependent weights wp indicated in the inset.

where by construction this contribution is eliminated follow- ing a suggestion made recently by Semenov and Johner [94]. The normalization factor u appearing in Eq. (117) elimi- nates again a weak vertical scission energy dependence of the data. Obviously, W [pN] = 0 for perfectly Flory-distributed chains. Following Eq. (108) and Eq. (109) one expects

The functionals presented in Fig. 19 require high-accur- acy histograms. That PN is only approximately Flory dis- tributed can be more readily seen using the "non-exponential- ity parameter" Lp = 1 - (NP) /p! (N)P. Obviously, Lp = 0 for rigorously Gaussian chains. As stated in Eq. (113), we expect the non-exponentiality parameter to decay as Lp =

WpCuyu ~ 1/v (N), i.e. as the correlation hole potential of the typical melt chain. The main panel of Fig. 20 presents Lp/WpCu as a function of (N) ~ 1/u. The predicted power- law decay is clearly demonstrated by the data. Note that the scaling of the vertical axis with the p-dependent geometrical factors wp allows to bring all moments on the same master curve. As can be seen from the inset of Fig. 20, this scaling is significant since wp varies over nearly a decade. Deviations from the predicted scaling are visible, not surprisingly, for small (N) < 10. Since the coefficient Cu is known the data collapse on the theoretical prediction (bold line) has been produced without any free adjustable parameter.

## 4.7 Summary



In this section we have discussed various thermodynamic properties of BFM melts at our reference volume fraction $ = 8p = 0.5. For large overlap penalties x = €/T » 1 all thermodynamic properties remain similar to the known val- ues for athermal BFM systems (x = 0) [129, 130, 84]. From

30

the computational point of view this is of some interest since it suggests the equilibration and sampling of configurations at a reasonable cost at overlap penalties between x = 1 and x = 10 where the slithering snake algorithm is still efficient. Decreasing the monomer interaction further we have found, as one expects, good agreement with the prediction by Ed- wards, Eq. (69), for small overlap penalties (x << 1). In this limit the thermodynamics is essentially determined by the second virial contribution, Eq. (89). Interestingly, being the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the in- verse temperature the specific heat cy allows the verifica- tion of the predicted scaling of the free energy contribu- tion -kBT /§3p due to the chain connectivity (Fig. 13). The central control parameter of this work, the dimensionless compressibility g = limNo (limq->0S(q,N)), is discussed in Sec. 4.4. While the determination of g(x) is numerically trivial for large overlap penalties, more care is needed for x «1 (Fig. 14). Note that the static RPA, Eq. (45), breaks down in the opposite limit (x >> 1) where the structure fac- tors of beads and polymer melts become ultimately identical, S(q)~g<1.

For a test chain of length n = N immersed into a bath of monodisperse chains of length N we have confirmed by thermodynamic integration in Sec. 4.5 that the chemical po- tential UN is essentially extensive with respect to the chain length, as expected from Flory's ideality hypothesis. In order to demonstrate that the small deviations predicted by the per- turbation theory [88] exist, we have investigated in Sec. 4.6 essentially Flory-distributed (Fig. 10) self-assembled EP sys- tems. The detailed analysis of the measured length distribu- tion PN (Fig. 19) has allowed us to show the existence of a correction 8un, Eq. (108), scaling essentially as the cor- relation hole penalty 8un ~ u*(n) for n « (N). The ob- served deviations for EP systems [88] beg for an improved numerical verification by means of the thermodynamic in- tegration method (Sec. 4.5) for test chains immersed into monodisperse melts.57

## 5 Intramolecular conformational properties



## 5.1 Introduction



We turn now to the description of intrachain conformational properties of BFM melts at volume fraction ø = 0.5 and tem- perature T = 1 comparing our numerical results to the the- oretical predictions announced in Sec. 1.5 and Sec. 2. We discuss first the properties on monomeric level (Sec. 5.2) and show then how the effective bond length b for asymp- totically long chains can be obtained using the theoretical input developed in Sec. 2. We present then the bond-bond

57 The presented results for dense polymer solutions may also be of relevance to the chemical potential of dilute polymer chains at and around the O-point which has received attention recently [74, 165]. The reason for this connection is that (taken apart different prefactors) the same effective interaction potential v(q) ~ q2 enters the perturbation calculation in the low wavevector limit. A non-extensive correction δμη~ +1///n in three dimensions is thus to be expected.

Higher moments of the dis- tribution G(r,s) and its deviations 8G(r, s) from Flory's ide- ality hypothesis will be analyzed in Sec. 5.5 and Sec. 5.6, respectively. We turn finally to the characterization of an ex- perimental relevant observable, the intramolecular form fac- tor F (q).

## 5.2 Bond properties



We begin by characterizing local-scale features of the al- gorithm described in Sec. 3. By definition of our version of the BFM algorithm the bond length is allowed to fluc- tuate between 2 and v10. One expects that switching on the overlap penalty & will suppress large bonds due to the in- creasing pressure. The mean bond length is characterized by the root-mean-square length l. (Other moments yield similar results.) The mean bond length rapidly becomes (N > 20) chain length independent [50]. As can be seen from Fig. 21, l shows a monotonous decay between & ~ 3 and ¿ ~ 20. As other local properties, the bond length becomes constant in the small -¿ and large -¿ limits (dashed lines). The value l(¿ = 0) = 2.718 gives the lower bound for the effective bond length b(E) of asymptotically long chains (stars) ob- tained below.

Defining the bond angle 0 between two subsequent bonds by the scalar product cos(0) = ên · ên+1 of the normalized bond vectors êi = L;/L;|, the local chain rigidity may be char- acterized by (0) and (cos(0)). Note that (0) and (cos(0)) can be regarded as chain length independent, just as the mean bond length. The local rigidity is negligible for ¿ « 1, i.e. (0) ~90° and (cos(0))) ~ 0 due to the symmetry of the distribution p(0) with respect to 90°. The rigidity then in- creases around ¿ ~ 1 and becomes constant again for large

where (0)~82.2° and (cos(0)}~0.106 [86]. The increase of the local rigidity for larger excluded volume interactions is of course expected due to the suppression of immediate backfoldings corresponding to bond angles 0 > 143º [52]. The distribution p(0) therefore becomes lopsided towards smaller 0 (not shown). According to Eq. (18) the effective bond length of a "freely rotating" (FR) chain is given by b(¿) =l(E) CFR with CFR = (1+(cos(0)})/ (1 - (cos(0)}). This simple model, indicated by the crosses in Fig. 21, yields a qualitatively reasonable trend (monotonous increase of the effective bond length at & ~ 1) but fails to fit the directly measured effective bond lengths quantitatively [86].

## 5.3 Mean-squared chain and subchain size



t=1/(N-1)1/2

## 5.3.1 Total chain size RN



One way to characterize the total chain size RN is to measure the second moment of the chain end-to-end distance Ry = ((rN-r1)2). We consider the ratio bN(E) = RN(E)/ VN -1 to compare the measured chain size with the ideal chain be- havior which is commonly taken as granted [3,4,39] and which is the basis of our perturbation calculation (Sec. 2.4). The task is to extrapolate for the effective bond length b() = limN->> by (E) of asymptotically long chains. The ratio by(E) for N = 64 and N = 2048 and the asymptotic limit b(E) - obtained by extrapolation as described below - are pre- sented in Fig. 21. Obviously, bN(¿) -> l(¿ = 0) for all N in the small-& limit. bN (E) increases then in the intermediate E-window before it levels off at & ~ 10. The swelling due to the excluded volume interaction is the stronger the larger the chain length, i.e. bN(E) increases monotonously with N. This swelling thus cannot be attributed to a local rigidity as described, e.g., by the freely-rotating chain model.

The N-effect can be seen better in Fig. 22 where we have plotted by for several penalties E as a function of t = 1/VN - 1. The choice of the horizontal axis is motivated by Eq. (10) suggesting the linear relation

by(E)~b2(E) (1-c(E)cs(E)t) for N/g >> 1

(119)

with Cs = \24/13 / pb3 being the swelling coefficient de- fined in Sec. 1.5 and c(¿) an additional numerical prefactor of order unity. This prefactor has been introduced in agree- ment with Eq. (86). The reason for this coefficient is that the corrections to Gaussian behavior differ slightly for inter- nal chain segments [as described by Eq. (10)] and the total chain size which is characterized in Fig. 22. We remind that c-> I(c) ~1.59 for N-> o. However, since this value corre- sponds to the limit of a very slowly converging integral [84] it is better to use Eq. (119) as a two-parameter fit for b(E) and c(¿) and to crosscheck then whether the fitted c is of order unity. As shown in the figure for three overlap penalties, this method can be used reasonably for overlap penalties as low as ¿ ~ 0.1, albeit with decreasing & it systematically under- estimates the "true" b(¿)-values indicated in Table 1. Please note that N/g ~400 for E = 0.1 and N = 8192. Chains with

Fig. 22 Rescaled end-to-end distance by(E) = R(E)/(N - 1) as a function of t = 1/ VN - I for different E. The chains only remain Gaus- sian on all scales and all N for extremely small ¿. For ¿ ≥ 0.1 one ob- serves by(E) to decay linearly in agreement with Eq. (119). This can be used for a simple two-parameter fit for the effective bond length b(E) as indicated for € = 0.1, 1.0 and co.

N > 8192 would be required to use this method for even smaller ¿. In this limit it is better to use as a first step the value bN(¿) of the largest chain length simulated as a (rather reasonable) lower bound for b(¿).

## 5.3.2 Subchain size Rs



The mean-squared subchain size R2 is presented in Figs. 23 and 24 where we focus on melts without monomer over- lap (€ = 0) [84]. We show how the effective bond length b for asymptotically long chains may be extrapolated from the measured R3 for finite arc-length s and finite chain length N using the perturbation prediction Eq. (10).

As already remarked by Auhl et al. [73], Fig. 23 shows clearly that the chains are swollen, i.e. R3 /s increases sys- tematically and this up to very large arc-length s. In agree- ment with Eq. (10), the Gaussian behavior (horizontal line) is approached from below and the deviation decays as us ~ 1/vs. The indicated bold line corresponds to b = 3.244 and Cs ~0.41 which fits nicely the data over several decades in s - provided that chain end effects can be neglected (s << N). Note that a systematic underestimation of the true effec- tive bond length would be obtained by taking the largest R2/s ~ 3.232 value available, say, for monodisperse chains of length N = 2048. Interestingly, R2/s does not approach the asymptotic limit monotonically [73,84]. Especially for short chains one finds a non-monotonic behavior for s -> N. This means that the total chain end-to-end distance RN shows even more pronounced deviations from the asymp- totic limit. We emphasize that the non-monotonicity of R3 / s becomes weaker with increasing N and that, as one expects, the inner distances, as well as the total chain size, are char- acterized by the same effective bond length b for large s or

Fig. 23 Mean-squared subchain size R2/s vs. s for different chain length N. Log-linear coordinates are used to emphasize the power law swelling over several orders of magnitude of s. The data approach the asymptotic limit (horizontal line) from below, i.e. the chains are swollen. This behavior is well fitted by Eq. (10) for 1 « s « N (bold line). Non-monotonous behavior is found for s -> N, especially for small N [73]. The dashed line indicates the measured total chain end- to-end distances by showing even more pronounced deviations. The dash-dotted line compares this data with Eq. (86).

N.58 The non-monotonic behavior may be qualitatively un- derstood by the reduced self-interactions at the chain ends which lessens the swelling on these scales. Our perturba- tion prediction Eq. (86) is indicated in Fig. 23 by the dash- dotted line. As already remarked, this prediction contains a slowly converging numerical integral of order unity. The dash-dotted line corresponds to the value c = 1(0) ~1.59 predicted for asymptotically long chains, the dashed line to the slightly smaller value c = 1.45 fitted in Fig. 22. In sum- mary, it is clear that one should use the subchain size Rs rather than the total chain size RN to obtain in a computa- tional study a reliable fit of the effective bond length b.

The representation chosen in Fig. 23 is not the most con- venient one for an accurate determination of b and cs. How precise coefficients may be obtained according to Eq. (10) is addressed in the Fig. 24 for chains of length N = 2048. In a first step R3/s should be plotted as a function of 1/ ys just as in Fig. 22. This allows for a first rough estimation of b. Since data for large s are less visible in this representation, we recommend for the fine-tuning of b to switch then to log- arithmic coordinates with a vertical axis K1(s) = 1 - R3/b2s for different trial values of b. The correct value of b is found by adjusting the axes such that K1 (s) extrapolates linearly as a function of cs/ Vs to zero for large s.59 We assume for the fine-tuning that higher order perturbation corrections may be neglected, i.e. we take Eq. (10) literally. The plot shows that this method is very sensitive, yielding a best value b = 3.244 for & = o that agrees with the theory over more than one

58 We note en passant that this is not the case for the compact chain conformations adopted by chains in strictly 2D melts where the effec- tive bond length associated to the chain ends is smaller than the one for subchains even for N -> % [120].

59 For the bead-spring model presented in Ref. [84] the empirical swelling coefficient cs is shown to differ for yet unknown reasons by a few percents from the predicted value v24/ 713 / pb3.

order of magnitude without curvature. Using this method we have determined the effective bond lengths b(¿) for a broad range of overlap penalties E as indicated in Table 1 and shown by the stars in Fig. 21 [86].

## 5.3.3 Predicting the effective bond length



Up to now, we have used the theoretical results to fit the ef- fective bond length b(E), rather than to predict it from the known thermodynamic properties and local model features such as the bond length l(¿). As reminded in Eq. (72) the increase of the effective bond length for weakly interacting and asymptotically long polymer melts has been in fact cal- culated long ago by Edwards [4]. Following a suggestion made by Muthukumar and Edwards [43] this perturbation result may be rewritten as a recursion relation

+1 = 12 | 1+- (1+ N G) M with Gi = 1

(120)

Vgb?p

with bi being the bond length after the i-th iteration step, g the measured dimensionless compressibility and Gi(bi,g) the relevant Ginzburg parameter quantifying the strength of the interaction acting on a chain segment of length s = g. Since Gz ~ Gi becomes small for large compressibilities g(¿), one expects good agreement with our data for small ¿. If we set bo = l(E) this yields after one iteration (i = 1) the dash-dotted line indicated in Fig. 21, i.e. a reasonable predic- tion is only achieved up to ¿ ~ 0.01. The predictive power of Eq. (120) can be considerably improved over nearly two decades up to E ~ 1 if one applies the formula iteratively using the effective bond length bị obtained at step i as input for the Ginzburg parameter for computing bi+1. This recur- sion converges rapidly as shown by the bold line indicated

33

in Fig. 21 obtained after 20 iterations.60 Note that Gz < 0.34 for & < 1 where Eq. (120) fits our data nicely. The fix-point solution of Eq. (120) does not capture correctly the leveling off of b(E) setting in above & ~ 1. Since the Ginzburg pa- rameter becomes there of order one, this is to be expected. In summary, we have shown that the iteration of Eq. (120) allows a good prediction for b(E) for Gz(E) << 1. If reliable values for compressibilities g(¿) » 1 are available, this is the method of choice if one cannot afford to simulate very long chains.

## 5.4 Bond-bond correlation function



## 5.4.1 Bond-bond correlation function P1 (s)



As we have seen in Fig. 24, to demonstrate the deviations from Flory's ideality hypothesis starting from the subchain size R2 requires to subtract a large Gaussian contribution b2s. Unfortunately, this requires as a first step the precise determination of the effective bond length b(¿) for asymp- totically long chains which might not be available. Indeed we have used in the preceding Sec. 5.3.2 the fact that the scaling of K1(s) critically depends on this accurate value to improve the estimation of b(E). Hence, it would be nice to demonstrate directly the scaling implied by our key pre- diction without any tunable parameter. The trick to achieve this is similar to our demonstration of the density fluctu- ation contributions to the free energy, Eq. (69), presented in Sec. 4.3: We consider the curvature of R2, i.e. its sec- ond derivative with respect to s. Using Eq. (4) this second derivative is obtained directly from the bond-bond correla- tion function P1(s) computed by averaging over all pairs of monomers (n,m =n+s). We remind that P1 (s) is generally believed to decrease exponentially as in Eq. (15). This text- book belief is based on the assumption that all long range in- teractions are negligible on distances larger than §. Hence, only correlations along the backbone of the chains should matter and it is then straightforward to work out that an ex- ponential cutoff is inevitable due to the multiplicative loss of any information transferred recursively along the chain [2].

Provided that 1 < < < N, all data sets collapse on the power law slope with exponent @ = 3/2 (bold line) as predicted by Eq. (9). The dash- dotted curve P1(s) ~ exp(-s/1.5) shows that exponential behavior is only compatible with very small chain lengths. The dashed lines cor- respond to the theoretical prediction, Eq. (121), for short chains with N = 16,32, 64 and 128 (from left to right).

The bond-bond correlation function P1 (s) obtained for monodisperse chains at ø = 0.5 and ¿ = œ is presented in Fig. 25. The power-law decay with exponent @ = 3/2 pre- dicted by our key perturbation result Eq. (9) is perfectly confirmed by the larger chains (N > 256). As can be seen for N = 16, exponentials are compatible with the data of short chains, however. This might explain why the power- law scaling has been overlooked in older numerical stud- ies, since good statistics for large chains (N > 1000) has only become available recently. However, it is clearly shown that P1(s) approaches systematically the scale-free asymp- tote with increasing N. The departure from this limit is fully

Con- sidering that non-universal features cannot be neglected for short chain properties and that the theory does not allow for any free fitting parameter, the agreement found in Fig. 25 is rather satisfactory.

The bond-bond correlation function P1(s) for different overlap penalties ¿ is presented in Fig. 26 for chains of length N = 2048 [86]. As can be seen from the unscaled data shown in the inset, P1(s) approaches a power law with exponent @ = 1/2 (dashed line) in the limit of weak overlap penal- ties in agreement with Eq. (84). For ¿ ≥ 1 our data is com- patible with an exponent @ = 3/2 (dash-dotted line) as sug- gested by Eq. (9). Hence, we have demonstrated without any tunable parameter that Flory's ideality hypothesis is system- atically violated for all segment lengths s and all overlap penalties ¿. As suggested by Eq. (83), the main panel of Fig. 26 presents P1 (s)/(cp/g3/2) as a function of the reduced arc-length u = s/g using the dimensionless compressibilities g(¿) and effective bond lengths b(¿) from Table 1. The data collapse is remarkable as long as 1 « s « N. The relation Eq. (83) is indicated by the bold line; it is in perfect agree- ment with the simulation data.61 The asymptotical behavior with @ = 1/2 for u << 1 and @ = 3/2 for u >> 1 is shown by the dashed and dash-dotted lines, respectively. As predicted by Eq. (9), one recovers the power law PI(s) = cp/s3/2 irre- spective of the blob size g. This suggests that the exponent @ = 3/2 is not due to local physics on the monomer scale, since for s >> g > 1 distances much larger than the monomer or even the thermal blob are probed.

Fig. 27 The angular correlations are characterized by the bond-bond correlation function P1(r) = (L . L) /12 averaging over all pairs of bonds of a chain of same distance r = |r]. The data shown has been obtained for EP of a broad range of scission energies E. If PI (r) (N) is traced as a function of r/r all data points collapse. Confirming the general scaling idea Eq. (122) the bold line indicates the predicted power-law asymptote Eq. (123) for r/r << 1, i.e. the bond-bond corre- lations are truely long-ranged. The plateau PI (r) (N) = c+ = 0.14 seen for r/r$ >> 1 is due the the enhanced weight of stretched chain seg- ments [87]. The complete perturbation prediction Eq. (125) given by the thin line interpolates perfectly between the power-law asymptote (bold line) and the plateau (dashed line).

We have seen in the previous paragraph that P1 (s) decays for s/g >> 1 as a power law with an exponent @ = dv = 3/2. Since the decay of P1(s) resembles the return probability of a random walk Go(r -> 0, s), it is tempting [74] to attribute the observed effect to "local self-kicks" at a distance r~ 0 involving the bonds Z, and L, themselves (or their immediate neighbors). Accordingly, the bond-bond correlation function should reveal a 8(r)-correlation if sampled as a function of the distance r = |r| between bond pairs. This interpretation turns out to be incorrect, however, and we will show that the power law in s simply translates as [87]

s-( ← (r/b)-ω/v = (r/b)-d.

(122)

As demonstrated analytically in Sec. B.5, one expects indeed for incompressible solutions of infinite chains that

Pı(r)~ Po(r) 12πρι3

Coo for y << r << r* (123)

as suggested by Eq. (122), i.e. the angular correlations are genuinely long-ranged. As discussed in Sec. B.5.4 the up- per cutoff r$ arises due to the enhanced weight of stretched chain segments which align bond pairs for distances r » r *. Unfortunately, this cutoff increases rather slowly with chain length [87]

The simulation of computationally challenging chain lengths thus is required to demonstrate numerically the predicted

power-law decay of P1 (r). Generalizing Eq. (123) for Flory- distributed EP one obtains according to Eq. (220) that

## P1(r)=Po(r)h(x)+ c*ul



(125)

with h(x) = (1+2x)2 exp(-2x) being a scaling function of x = Vur/2a and c+ a phenomenological constant set (in practice) by the finite local chain rigidity. The angular cor- relation function P1(r) for EP systems is thus predicted to level off for large reduced distances.62

We present in Fig. 27 numerical results obtained for sys- tems containing Flory-distributed EP. As indicated in the sketch, P1 (r) is obtained by averaging of all intrachain bond pairs of same distance r. To avoid trivial correlations the sec- ond bond L is outside the subchain between the monomer n and m defining the vector r [87,89]. Model-depending physics not taken into account by theory obviously becomes relevant for short distances corresponding to subchains of a couple of monomers. For clarity, we have thus omitted data points with r ≤ 5. For small distance r « rx the (un- scaled) bond-bond correlation function P1 (r) is found to de- cay strongly as expected from Eq. (125). Note that in this limit P1(r) does neither depend on the mean chain length nor the chain length distribution, i.e. the same behavior is observed for monodisperse chains. See Ref. [87] for details. To scale away the (N)-dependence in the large-r limit, we trace in Fig. 27 the rescaled bond-bond correlation function

62 For monodisperse systems one finds instead PI(r) ~ (r/N)2 for very large distances r with RN < r ≤ Nl due to the increasing contri- bution of stretched bonds [87].

## 5.5 Higher moments



The preceding discussion focused on the second moment of the subchain size distribution G(r, s) and its derivatives with respect to s. We have also computed higher moments (12p> with p ≤5 [84]. (For clarity we focus here on monodisperse chains.) We compare these moments in Fig. 28 with Eq. (77) tracing the cummulant Kp(s) defined in Eq. (26) as a func- tion of

x = 3(2Pp!p)2 Cs (126) .

## 2(2p+1)! Vs



All data sets collapse nicely on the prediction (bold line) for small x.64 It is important that the same effective bond length b is obtained from the analysis of all functions Kp(s) as illus- trated in Fig. 28. Otherwise we would regard equilibration and statistics as insufficient.

The failure of Flory's hypothesis can also be demon- strated by means of the non-Gaussianity parameter &p (s) de- fined in Eq. (27) which compares the 2p-th moment with the

63 The clearly visible plateau can be used to determine the coefficient c+. The same coefficient can then be used for fitting the large-r behav- ior of monodisperse systems. Note that the best fit value c = 0.14 is close to P1 (s = 1) = {In . Ln+1> /12 ~ 0.10, the independently deter- mined bond-bond correlation between adjacent bond vectors.

64 The curvature of the data at small s is due to the finite extensibility of the subchains which becomes more marked for higher moments.

Fig. 29 presents ap(s) vs. Cs/ Vs for three moments. For each p we find perfect data collapse for all N which con- firms the expected linear relationship ap(s) ~ u*(s).65 The lines indicate the theoretical prediction Eq. (78). The pref- actors 6/5, 111/35 and 604/105 for p = 2, 3 and 4 respec- tively are nicely confirmed. They increase strongly with p, i.e. the non-Gaussianity becomes more pronounced with in- creasing p. Hence, b should be best fitted by the second mo- ment where the non-Gaussian behavior is the weakest.

Figure 30 presents a similar correlation function which measures the non-Gaussian correlations of different spatial directions. It is defined by Kry (s) = 1 -(x2 y2} / {x2> <> for the two spatial components x and y of the vector r as il- lustrated by the sketch given at the bottom of Fig. 30. Sym- metry allows to average over the three pairs of directions (x,y), (x, z) and (x,z). Following the general scaling argu- ment given in Sec. 2 we expect Kry(s) ~ u*(s) ~ cs/ VS which is confirmed by the perturbation result

Kxy(s) = K2(s) = 3 Ts 6 cs (127)

This is nicely confirmed by the linear relationship found (bold line) on which all data from both simulation models collapse perfectly. The different directions of subchains are therefore coupled. As explained at the end of Appendix B.1, Kxy(s) and d2 (s) must be identical if the Fourier transformed subchain size distribution G(q,s) can be expanded in terms of q2 and this irrespective of the values the expansion coeffi- cients take. Fig. 30 confirms, hence, that our computational systems are perfectly isotropic and tests the validity of the

general analytical expansion. The correlation function Kry is of particular interest since the zero-shear viscosity should be proportional to )~(x2y2)= {x2} {y2 } (1 - Kxy (s) where we assume following Edwards [4] that only intrachain stresses contribute to the shear stress Oxy. Hence, our results suggest that the classical calculations [4] - assuming incor- rectly Kry = 0 - should be revisited.

## 5.6 Corrections to the subchain size distribution



We turn finally to the subchain size distribution G(r, s) itself which is presented in Fig. 31. From the theoretical point of view G(r,s) is the most fundamental property from which all others can be derived. The normalized histograms G(r, s) are computed by counting the number of subchain vectors be- tween r - dr/2 and r + dr/2 with dr being the width of the bin and one divides then by the spherical bin volume. Since the BFM model is a lattice model, this volume is not 4nr2 dr but given by the number of lattice sites the subchain vector can actually point to for being allocated to the bin. Incorrect histograms are obtained for small r if this is not taken into account. Averages are taken over all (sub)chains, just as be- fore. Clearly, non-universal physics must show up for small vector length r and small curvilinear distance s and we con- centrate therefore on values r » o and s ≥ 31. When plot- ted in linear coordinates as in Fig. 11 of [84], G(r,s) com- pares roughly with the Gaussian prediction G0(r,s) given by Eq. (2), but presents a distinct depletion for small subchain vectors with n = r/by/s << 1 and an enhanced regime for n ~ 1. To analyse the data it is better to consider instead of G(r, s) the relative deviation 8G(r,s)/Go(r,s) = G(r,s)/Go(r,s) - 1 which should further be divided by the strength of the sub- chain correlation hole, cs/ Vs. As presented in Fig. 31 this yields a direct test of the relation Eq. (75) derived in Ap- pendix B.2. The figure demonstrates nicely the scaling of the data for all s. It shows further a good collapse of the data close to the universal function f(n) predicted by theory (bold line). Note that the depletion scales as 1/n for small subchain vectors (dashed line). The agreement of simulation and theory is by all standards remarkable. Obviously, error bars increase strongly for n >> 1 where Go(r,s) decreases strongly. The regime for very large n where the finite exten- sibility of subchain matters has been omitted for clarity. We emphasize that this scaling plot depends very strongly on the value b which is used to calculate the Gaussian reference distribution.66

## 5.7 Intramolecular form factor F(q)



The form factor F(q) defined in Sec. 2.2.4 is an important property since it allows to make a connection between the- ory and simulation on the one hand and experiments of real systems on the other hand [5]. Figure 32 presents the (un- scaled) form factors obtained for four different scission en- ergies E for our EP model at Ø = 0.5. The three differ- ent q-regimes are indicated. Details of the length distribu- tion pN matter in the Guinier regime which probes the to- tal coil size. Non-universal contributions to the form factor arise in the "Bragg regime" at large wavevectors. Obviously, the larger E the wider the intermediate Kratky regime where

66 As shown in Ref. [84], a similar plot can be achieved which does not require a precise value of b if the reduced deviation y is plotted as a function of r/Rs using the measured subchain size Rs.

Fig. 32 Intramolecular form factor F(q) vs. wavevector q for EP of various scission energies E [83]. The ideal chain form factor for Flory- distributed polymers, Eq. (40), is indicated by the solid line. In the Kratky regime between the total chain and monomer sizes the form factor expresses the fractal dimension of the Gaussian coil, Eq. (35), as shown by the dashed line. Experimentally, this is the most important regime since it is, e.g., not affected by the (a priori unknown) poly- dispersity. The computational data reveal an additional regime at large wavevectors corresponding to the monomer structure ("Bragg regime") which is not treated by the theory.

Fig. 33 Kratky representation of F(q)q2 vs. q for monodisperse quenched polymers (crosses) and equilibrium polymers (open sym- bols). The non-monotonous behavior predicted by the theory is clearly demonstrated. The ideal chain form factor (thin line), overpredicts the dip of the form factor at q ~0.7 by about 20%. The bold line indicates the prediction for infinite chains, Eq. (14). The data is fitted assuming the effective bond length b ~3.244.

chain length, polydispersity and local physics do not con- tribute much to the deviations of the form factor from ideal- ity. A very similar plot has been obtained for monodisperse polymers (not shown). Not surprisingly, it demonstrates that the form factors of both system classes become indistin- guishable for large wavevectors. Note that the F (q) obtained for EP of different E can be brought to collapse by tracing F(q)/F(0) as a function of Q= qRg,z with F (0) = {N2} / {N} and Rg,z the measured z-averaged radius of gyration as indi- cated in Table 3 [83]. A similar plot can again be obtained for monodisperse chains using F(0) = N and Q = qRg(N).

37

Interestingly, a careful inspection of Fig. 32 reveals that Eq. (40) overestimates systematically the data in the Kratky regime. This can be seen more clearly in the Kratky repre- sentation given in Fig. 33 in linear coordinates.67 We present here the systems with the longest masses currently available for both monodisperse (N = 4096 and N = 8192) and EP systems (E = 14 and E = 15) [83]. The non-monotonous behavior is in striking conflict with Flory's hypothesis. The difference between the ideal Gaussian behavior (thin line) and the data becomes up to 20%. This difference is qualita- tively expected from the perturbation theory result, Eq. (14), derived in Appendix B.3. The predicted scaling can be eas- ily understood by means of a simple scaling relation follow- ing the discussion in Sec. 2.3.6. As the arc-length s is re- lated to the wavevector q and the ideal form factor Fo(q) by s(q) ~ 1/\q|2 ~ Fo(q), it follows for the difference of mea- sured and ideal form factors that [82]

8 ( 1 ) = Folg (+(a)-1)~1×1}~ 19 F P (128)

which agrees with Eq. (14).68 The important feature of this q|3-correction is that it depends neither on the strength of the excluded volume interaction nor on the effective bond length b. Hence, it must be generally valid, even for semidi- lute solutions.69 The prediction for infinite N, Eq. (14), can- not capture the decrease of the form factor for small q lead- ing to the Guinier regime where F (q) is determined by the finite size of the simulated chains. A clearer evidence for the theory should thus be obtained by a different comparison be- tween theory and simulation, which accounts for the finite-N effects.

This is achieved in Fig. 34 which focuses on deviations 8(1/F(q)) =1/F(q) -1/Fo(q) for monodisperse systems with F0(q) being the Debye formula. As above in our dis- cussion of the subchain distribution G(r, s) and its moments one should avoid to use as Gaussian reference the ideal chain form factor F0(q) expressed in terms of the effective bond length b since the latter property might not be sufficiently accurate. A variation of a few percents breaks the scaling and leads to qualitatively different curves [83] as in Fig. 24 for the moment K1(s). Since such a precision is normally not available (neither in simulation nor in experiment) it is of interest to seek for a more robust representation of the

67 Such "Kratky plots" are commonly used to represent neutron scat- tering experiments and to test Flory's ideality hypothesis. In applica- tions, the existence of a Kratky plateau appears to be elusive [5]. Pos- sible causes for deviations are effects of chain stiffness and finite chain thickness. In special cases, the scattering signals from chain stiffness and thickness may compensate one another, leading fortuitously to an extended Kratky plateau [167, 168]. Apparently, "Kratky plots have to be interpreted with care" [5].

68 This is the same scaling dependence which leads to PI(r) ~ 1/p|r|d ~ 1/p(bs1/2)d ~ P1 (s) for the bond-bond correlation function as a function of r or s as investigated in Sec. 5.4.1.

69 It applies then for q << 1/§ with § being the semidilute blob length [3]. We have checked that the result from the renormalization group theory for semidilute solutions [7,71] takes the same form as Eq. (14) with an amplitude 0.03124 that is within 0.03% of our 1/32 [83].

Fig. 34 Scaling attempt of the non-Gaussian deviations for monodis- perse polymers in terms of the measured radius of gyration Rg (N). As suggested by Eq. (14), the difference 1/F(q) - 1/Fo(q) of the mea- sured and the ideal chain Debye form factor has been rescaled by the factor Np /p and plotted as a function of Q = qRg. We obtain perfect data collapse for all chain lengths included. (Obviously, data points in the Bragg limit q ~ 1 do not scale.) Note that the power law slope, m(Q) = Q3/32, predicted by Eq. (14), can be seen over more then one order of magnitude. In the Guinier regime, the difference increases more rapidly, m(Q) ~ Q4 (dashed line), as one expects from a standard analytic expansion in Q2.

form factor deviations which does not rely on b. The refer- ence chain size is thus set in Fig. 34 by the measured ra- dius of gyration Rg(N) which is used for rescaling the axis and, more importantly, to compute Fo(q). (A virtually indis- tinguishable plot has been obtained for EP.) The scaling of the vertical axis is suggested by Eq. (14) which predicts the difference of the inverse form factors to be proportional to Nº q3. Without additional parameters (Rg is known to high precision) we confirm the scaling of

as a function of Q = qRg(N) with px =N/R3 being the self- density. Importantly, our simulations allow us to verify for Q >> 5 the fundamentally novel Q3 behavior of the master curve predicted by Eq. (14) and this over more than an or- der of magnitude! In this representation we do not find a change of sign for the form factor difference (8F (q) is al- ways negative) and all regimes can be given on the same plot in logarithmic coordinates. In the Guinier regime we find now m(Q) ~ Q4 which is readily explained in terms of a standard expansion in Q2 since the first two terms in Q0 and Q2 must vanish by construction because of the defini- tion of Rg(N), Eq. (39).

Fig. 35 The displacement auto-correlation function C(t) of dense overdamped colloids is known to reveal a negative algebraic long-time tail due to long-range dynamical interactions caused by the weak com- pressibility of the solution [11]: If a particle (filled sphere) is displaced at time t = 0 by a distance u(0) along the x-axis, this creates a density dipole (bold peaks) decaying in time by cooperative diffusion (dashed line). The gradient of the chemical potential associated to the decay- ing field generates a drag pulling the particle (open sphere) back to its original position. We argue [90] that a related mechanism causes scale- free correlations of the displacements of (sub)chains in dense polymer solutions without topological constraints.

to the predicted deviations with respect to Flory's ideality hypothesis. From the computational side the most important point is discussed in Sec. 5.3.2 where we show how the ef- fective bond length b for asymptotically long chains should be extrapolated from subchains of finite arc-length with g << s « N. That the deviations are indeed due to long-range interactions has been demonstrated from the scaling of the bond-bond correlation function P1(r) ~ 1/r3 in Sec. 5.4.2.

The most important finding from the experimental side concerns the scale-free deviations demonstrated for the form factor F(q), Eq. (14). We have shown that the Kratky plot does not exhibit the plateau expected for Gaussian chains in the intermediate wavevector range. These deviations should be measurable by neutron scattering experiments of flexible chains. Unfortunately, finite persistence length effects may mask the predicted behavior if the chains are not sufficiently long. An experimental verification - e.g. following the lines of the the promising recent study [168] - would be of great fundamental interest; it could also delineate the conditions where the predicted conformational corrections to ideality are relevant in real polymer systems and must be considered in understanding their structure, phase behavior and equi- librium dynamics. It is to the latter point we turn now our attention.

6 Scale-free dynamical correlations in polymer melts

## 6.1 Introduction



## 6.1.1 Prelude: Overdamped colloids



Dense, essentially incompressible simple liquids with con- served momentum are known to exhibit long-range corre- lations of the particle displacement field [11, 169]. As first shown in the MD simulations by Alder and Wainwright [169],

39

the coupling of displacement and momentum fields mani- fests itself by an algebraic decay of the VCF,

C(t)=(v(t). y(0)) ~+1/Ša(t)d ~+1/tad,

(130)

with v(t) being the particle velocity at time t and Ša (t) ~to the typical particle displacement with exponent a = 1/2.70 Interestingly, even if the momentum conservation is dropped, as justified for overdamped dense colloidal suspensions [11], scale-free albeit much weaker correlations are to be expected due to the incompressibility constraint [11,170]. As illus- trated in Fig. 35, the motion of a tagged colloid is coupled to the collective density dipole field,

## 8p(r,t)~ 1 u(0).L exp [-(r/Ša(t))2] fort > 0, (131)



5d(t) ≤2(t)

created by the colloid's own displacement u(0) at t = 0. Af- ter averaging over the typical displacements of the test par- ticle and assuming a Cahn-Hilliard response proportional to the gradient Vu (r) of the chemical potential u (r) of the den- sity field [1], this leads to a negative algebraic decay

C(t) ~ - 1/5a(t)d+2 ~ - 1/tw with @ = (d +2) a, (132) e.g., 0 = 5/2 in d = 3 dimensions. This phenomenological scaling picture agrees with more systematic mode-coupling calculations [11,170,171]. It has been confirmed computa- tionally by means of Lattice-Boltzmann simulations [171], MD simulations [172] and even MC simulations with local moves [90] as demonstrated in Sec. 6.2.72

## 6.1.2 Polymer melts without topological constraints



The finding of long-range static correlations in dense poly- mer solutions discussed in Sec. 5 begs the question of whe- ther a similar interplay of chain connectivity and incom- pressibility leads to similar scale-free and g-independent dy- namical correlations. To avoid additional physics we focus on model systems where hydrodynamic [92] and topolog- ical constraints may be considered to be negligible, as in the pioneering work by Paul et al. [50,51], or are deliber- ately switched off [54,55,84]. As we have summarized in Sec. 1.5, deviations from Rouse-type dynamics have been reported for such systems in various numerical and experi- mental studies. The effective exponent ß ~ 0.8 characteriz- ing the short-time CM diffusion, Eq. (13), is of course in- consistent with the key assumption of the Rouse model that the random forces acting on the chains are uncorrelated. We attempt here to clarify this problem using the BFM variant with topology non-conserving local L26-moves described in Sec. 3. Obviously, it would not be possible to equilibrate

70 The discussion is strongly simplified. Strictly speaking, it is not the particle diffusion which sets the dynamical length scale but the diffusive propagation of the transverse momentum [169].

71 Prefactors are omitted for simplicity. Especially, we do not dis- tinguish between the self diffusion of the particle and the collective diffusion of the field characterized by rather different coefficients [11].

72 Interestingly, the same power-law exponent @ = (d+2)/2 is also seen in Brownian dynamics simulations of the Lorentz model [173].

BFM configurations with chain lengths up to N = 8192 us- ing local moves. Taking thus advantage of the configurations obtained using global MC moves we demonstrate that the VCF CN(t) associated to the chain CM displacements does not vanish, but instead decays as [90]

CN(1) -(RN)(PN f(+/IN) (133)

with f(x) being a universal scaling function. Note that the postulated Eq. (133) does not depend explicitly on the com- pressibility of the solution. The squared characteristic "ve- locity" (RN/TN)2 arises for dimensional reasons. The sec- ond prefactor p/p stems from the interaction of chains and subchains imposed by the incompressibility constraint.73 As one expects from Eq. (132), the scaling function decays for x> 1 as f(x) ~1/x@ with an exponent @=(d+2)/2. More importantly, it will be shown that this long-time behavior is preceded for x « 1 by a much weaker algebraic decay with @ = (d +2) a = 5/4 for d = 3 (134)

due to the much slower relaxation (x = 1/4) of the collective dipole field of subchains which was generated by the initial displacement of the tagged subchain at t = 0. The gradient of the chemical potential Vu(r) pulling the reference sub- chain back to its original position is of course not only due to the density fluctuation of the subchain density field but also to the tensional forces along the chains caused by the dis- placement. However, since subchain density fluctuations and tensions are coupled, their free energy contributions cause chemical potential gradients of the same order kBT sºNº and are thus identical from the scaling point of view [90,91].

## 6.1.3 Outline



Reminding first how a VCF may be defined and determined in a Monte Carlo simulation [174], we confirm in Sec. 6.2 that Eq. (132) holds for dense BFM beads. Section 6.3 fo- cuses then on polymer melts demonstrating the dynamical coupling of (sub)chains. Excluded volume and density ef- fects are discussed in Sec. 6.4. Preliminary simulation data for melts with topological constraints presented in Sec. 6.5 indicate that the early-time behavior, CN(t) ~ - N-1t-(d+2)/4 for t « TN, is preserved before entanglement effects set in. A perturbation calculation prediction for this time window is outlined in Sec. 6.6. In demonstrating Eqs. (133) and (134) our study focuses on one mechanism explaining the strik- ing deviations from the Rouse behavior observed in the lit- erature. See Refs. [175,99, 176,92, 93] for related theoretical studies. We stress that the presented MC simulations [90] are necessarily incomplete since important additional dynami- cal correlations arise due to the incomplete screening of hy- drodynamic interactions mentioned briefly in Sec. 7.2.3 [92, 93].

73 That the effect is proportional to the correlation hole penalty, ux ~ PN/p, may be guessed from the static correlations we have discussed in Sec. 5. The fact that the polymers behave as weakly interacting colloids for large times t/TN >> 1 confirms this scaling.

Since in MC simulations there is no "monomer mass", no (conserved or non-conserved) "monomer momentum" and not even an instantaneous velocity, it might at first sight ap- pear surprising that a well-posed "velocity correlation func- tion" (VCF) can be defined and measured. To illustrate that this is indeed the case is the first purpose of this subsection. The second is to verify that the negative analytic decay of the VCF expected for overdamped colloids, Eq. (132), is also of relevance for dense BFM beads (N = 1) diffusing through configuration space by means of local hopping moves on the lattice as shown in Fig. 6(b). The systems presented in Fig. 36 correspond to three different effective dimensions d. The effectively 1D systems (d = 1+) have been obtained by confining the beads to a thin capillary of square cross- section, the effectively 2D systems (d = 2+) by confining the beads to a thin slit as shown in Fig. 6(c). The distance H = 4 between parallel walls was chosen to allow the free crossing of the beads. (For the 1D case this is important, of course, since ordering the beads along the capillary al- ters dramatically the dynamics.) The data has been obtained for beads without monomer overlap (€ = 0) by means of L26-moves on a 3D cubic lattice with half of the available lattice sites being occupied ( = 0.5). We average over the 220 beads contained in each configuration.

One standard measure characterizing the monomer dis- placements is the mean-square displacement (MSD) h(t) = {(r(t) -r(0))2) displayed in the inset of Fig. 36 (with r(t) being the particle position at time t). As one expects, the monomer displacements become uncorrelated for t >> 1, i.e. h(t) ~ 2dDt with D being the monomer self-diffusion con- stant: D = 0.0187 for d = 1+, D = 0.0154 for d = 2+, D =

0.0382 for d = 3. The typical displacement Ša(t) = h1/2(t) thus scales as Ša(t) ~ to with x = 1/2. However, small de- viations are clearly visible for short times if h(t)/(2dDt) is plotted in log-linear coordinates. The deviations are par- ticular strong for d = 1+. The effective random forces act- ing on the beads are thus not completely white. Obviously, one might try to characterize these deviations by fitting vari- ous polynomials to the measured MSD. However, since one needs to subtract the rather large free diffusion contribution from the measured signal to characterize tiny deviations this is a numerically difficult if not impossible route.

In analogy to the bond-bond correlation function P1 (s) ~ 22R2 discussed in Sec. 5.4 allowing to make manifest de- viations from the Gaussian chain assumption, it is numeri- cally much better to directly compute the second derivative of h(t) with respect to time to avoid this large, but trivial contribution. How this can be done is illustrated in the main panel of Fig. 36. We sample equidistant series of configu- rations at time intervals &t = 1, 10, 100, ... as indicated by the open symbols. Each time series contains 104 configu- rations. Averaging over all possible pairs of configurations (to, to +t) we compute C(t, 8t) = (u(to +t) . u(to)>10 / dt2, i.e. a four-point correlation function of the monomer trajectories with u(t) = r(t+ 8t) - r(t) being the monomer displace- ment vector at time t in a time interval &t. By construction C(t,8t) = 0 if both displacement vectors are uncorrelated. According to Eq. (173) one expects

(+,St) ~ La?h(+) 81º for t > ôt. (135)

As can be seen for BFM beads in d = 1+ dimensions, the St- dependence indeed drops out for t/ St > 1 and we thus avoid the second index &t writing C(t) for the displacement (or velocity) correlation function. Obviously, the statistics dete- riorates for very large t/ St where fewer configuration pairs contribute to the average (taking apart that the signal itself decays). It is for this reason that a hierarchy of time series of different &t is needed. Taking for each &t only the first decade of data (2 ≤ t/8t < 20), these data sets are pasted to- gether and averaged logarithmically. The exponents @ = 3/2 (thin line), @ = 2 (dashed line) and @ = 5/2 (bold line) pre- dicted by Eq. (132) for d = 1, d = 2 and d = 3, respectively, compare well with our data over several orders of magni- tude in time, especially for d = 1+. Note that if one is sat- isfied with less orders of magnitude it is sufficient to check the exponents using just a time window &t = 1 as may be seen from the open spheres. The superposition of data from different time series is just a numerical trick which reduces the number of configurations to be stored and the number of configuration pairs to be computed for a given time t.

Fig. 38 Acceptance rate A, effective local mobility W and self- diffusion coefficient NDN vs. the monomer overlap penalty ¿. The data has been obtained using L26-moves at volume fraction $ = 0.5 [90]. All dynamical properties decrease monotonously with the interaction penalty but become essentially constant above our main working point at & = 10. The dashed line corresponds to the diffusion coefficient ac- cording to Eq. (137) and assuming the indicated mobilities W.

(Fig. 35), we turn now our attention to 3D melts of long and flexible homopolymers. As described in Sec. 3.4, we focus on systems with finite overlap penalty ¿ = 10 and volume fraction ø = 0.5 which we sample using local topology non- conserving L26-moves. As can be seen in Fig. 37 for chains of length N = 64 and N = 8192, these systems are essen- tially of Rouse-type. The monomer MSD h(t) is indicated

41

by the open symbols.74 As expected from Rouse dynamics we obtain the N-independent short-time asymptotics [4]

h(t) = b2(Wt)1/2Nº for 10 < < IN ~ N2 /W

(136) indicated by the dashed line (2x = 1/2). As can be seen for N = 64, the monomers diffuse again freely with a power-law slope 1 (thin lines) for times larger than the Rouse time TN. We remind that it was neither computationally feasible nor our goal to sample for our larger chains (N > 1000) over the huge times needed to make this free diffusion regime acces- sible. Following Paul et al. [51], the short-time power law, Eq. (136), can be used to determine the effective monomer mobility. We obtain W (¿ = 10) = 0.003 for our main work- ing point. Mobilities for other penalties are listed in Table 1. As may be seen from Fig. 38, W (E) decays with increasing excluded volume just as the acceptance rate A(¿) (spheres) of the Monte Carlo attempts, but the decay is even more pro- nounced for W (E), i.e. increasingly more accepted monomer moves do not contribute to the effective motion [51].

The full symbols displayed in Fig. 37 refer to the MSD hN(t)=((LN(t)-LN(0))2) of the CM IN(t) of chains of length N. As one expects for Rouse chains, the amplitude of hN(t) decreases inversely with N and the diffusion appears to be Fickian (hN(t) ~t) at least for timest >>t *~ 103Nº as indicated by the vertical arrow. Obviously, hN(t) and h(t) merge for times beyond the Rouse time (t >> TN). Fortu- nately, since hN(t) becomes linear for t* « TN, it is possi- ble for all N to measure the self-diffusion coefficient DN by plotting NhN(t)/6t vs. time t. For our main working point we obtain NDN( ¿= 10) ~ 0.009. Values for other & are again given in Table 1 and are represented in Fig. 38 (diamonds). These values compare nicely with the Rouse model predic- tion [4]

(137)

NDN = 5a2 w

shown by the dashed line in Fig. 38. Similarly, it is possi- ble (at least for our shorter chains) to measure the longest Rouse relaxation time TN by an analysis of the Rouse modes and to compare it with the Rouse model prediction [4] TN = 4N2 / 13W. We obtain again a nice agreement between di- rectly and indirectly computed relaxation times (not shown).

Up to now we have insisted on the fact that our systems are to leading order of Rouse type and we have character- ized them accordingly. However, deviations from the Rouse picture are clearly revealed for short times, especially for hN(t).75 In agreement with Eq. (13) the short-time CM mo- tion may be characterized by a power-law exponent ß ~ 0.8 (bold lines). Since in our BFM version topological con- straints are irrelevant, this shows that the deviations obtained for the classical BFM algorithm with topological constraints [51] cannot be attributed alone to precursor effects to repta- tional dynamics (which indeed exist as shown in Fig. 44).

74 For the large N sampled here it is inessential whether this average is performed over all monomers or only over a few monomers in the center of chains at i ~ N/2 as in [50,51,56].

75 That the monomer MSD h(t) also deviates for very short times is due to the trivial lower cut-off associated to the discretization.

42

8t=10000

Before we turn to the more precise numerical character- ization of these deviations by means of the associated dis- placement correlation function, let us ask whether the ob- served colored forces acting for short times on the CM of the entire chain are also relevant on the scale of subchains of arc-length s (1 « s ≤ N). To answer this question we compute the MSD hs (t) = ((rs(t) -rs(0))2> associated to the subchain CM rs (t) as shown in Fig. 37 for subchains of length s = 64 in the middle of total chains of length N = 8192 (crosses). Since for short times the subchain does not "know" that it is connected to the rest of the chain, one ex- pects it to behave as a total chain of the same length (s = N). This is indeed borne out by our data which are well de- scribed by

## shs (t) ~ NhN(t) fort << Ts ~ $2/W



(138)

for all chain length N and subchain length s studied. The subchains reveal thus for sufficiently short times the same colored forces as the total chain as can be clearly seen from the example given in Fig. 37. For larger times the subchain becomes "aware" that it is connected to the rest of the chain and gets enslaved by the monomer MSD, i.e. as expected from the Rouse model we observe

hs(t) ~h(t) ~ b2(Wt)1/250Nº for Ts Kt « TN (139)

and, obviously, hs(t) ~ hN(t) ~ h(t) ~ 6DNt for even larger times t » TN.

## 6.3.2 Locality and relevant exponent a



Two comments are in order here. First, it should be noticed that Eq. (138) expresses the fact that the effective forces acting on the N/s subchains of length s in a chain of total length N add up independently to the forces acting on the total chain. In this sense Eq. (138) states that the deviations from the Rouse picture must be local. We will explicitly ver- ify this below (Fig. 41).76 Second, if one chooses follow- ing Eq. (135) an arbitrary time window &t to characterize the displacement correlations, this corresponds to dynami- cal blobs containing s ~ vW &t adjacent monomers, which must move together due to the chain connectivity. Eq. (139) implies now that the dipole field77 associated with the CM of these s-subchains and created at t = 0 by a tagged s-subchain must decay according to a typical displacement Sa(t) ~ to with a = 1/4. It is this exponent « which is mentioned in Eq. (134). Since this exponent is smaller than for colloids (a = 1/2), the subchain field must decay more slowly and one thus expects a much weaker decay of the associated VCF.

76 The "locality" of the correlations described by Eq. (138) or Eq. (143) does not imply that the displacements of subchains around the reference subchain displaced at t = 0 are 8(r)-correlated.

77 We remind that, strictly speaking, it is not the dipole field associ- ated to the density of the subchain center-of-masses, but to their chem- ical potential. The use of the imprecise notion "density dipole field" might be excused by the fact that both fields are supposed to decay similarly with time t, chain length N and subchain length s.

We only indicate for each &t the data window which is used to construct (by logarithmic averaging) the final VCF CN(t). The bold lines represent the exponent @ = 5/4 which is generally observed for times 10 << t << TN. For N = 16 we also indicate the exponent @ = 5/2 (dashed line) expected for larger times where the polymer coils behave according to Eq. (132).

## 6.3.3 Center-of-mass velocity correlation function



Following the numerical strategy presented in Sec. 6.2, we characterize now more precisely the correlations seen for the chain MSD hN(t) and the subchain MSD hs (t) by computing directly their second derivative with respect to time t, i.e. the associated correlation functions CN(t) ~ 22hN(t)/2 and Cs(t) ~ 22hs (+)/2.

The VCF CN(t, 8t) = (u(t + to) . u(to)}to / ot2 for the dis- placement vector u(t) = LN(t+ 8t) - IN(t) of the chain CM 'N(t) is shown in Fig. 39 for two chain lengths, N = 16 (top) and N = 8192 (bottom). Averages are again performed over all configuration pairs (to,t + to) in the set of 104 config- urations sampled for each St. As in Sec. 6.2 we find that CN(t,8t) ~8tº fort >> St. For clarity, only the data subset is indicated for each &t which is used to construct the final VCF CN(t) (as shown below in Fig. 40). The bold lines rep- resent the predicted short-time exponent @ = 5/4 which can be observed for N = 8192 over nearly five orders of mag- nitude. For N = 16 we also indicate the exponent @ = 5/2 (dashed line) for t >> TN where the polymers should behave as colloids according to Eq. (132). Note that the magnitude of the signal decreases strongly with N, which together with the fact that fewer chains per box are available, makes the determination of CN(t) increasingly more delicate.

The N-dependence of the VCF CN(t) is further analyzed in Fig. 40. The rescaled VCF y = - CN(t)(b3p)/(WDN) is traced in panel (a) as function of the reduced time x = Wt using the monomer mobility W = 0.003 and the diffusion coefficient DN = 0.009/N determined above (Table 1). This scaling makes the axes dimensionless and rescales the verti- cal axis by a factor N. As shown by the successful data col- lapse for chain lengths ranging from N = 16 up to N = 8192 on the slope indicated by the bold line, the VCF scales ex- actly as CN(t) ~ 1/N fort << TN. This confirms the already

Fig. 40 Scaling of VCF CN(t) for different N [90]: (a) Rescaled VCF y =- CN(t)(b3p)/(WDN) vs. reduced time x = Wt. For times t << TN the VCF thus clearly scales as CN(t) ~ 1/N, i.e. the correlations must be due to ~ N local independent events. The exponent @ = 5/4 (bold line) is observed over up to five orders of magnitude in time. (b) Col- lapse of y = CN(t)/CTy with CTy ~ 1/N7/2 as a function of x = t/ TN confirming Eq. (133). The large time behavior (x » 1) is described by an exponent @ = 5/2 (dashed line). The exponent @ = 5/4 (bold line) for x «< 1 is demonstrated over eight orders of magnitude.

stated "locality" of the correlations, Eq. (138), i.e. the forces acting on subchains add up independently to the forces act- ing on the entire chain. We have still to motivate the pre- cise scaling used for the axes. According to Eq. (133) the VCF scales as a function of the reduced time t /TN. Substi- tuting the typical chain size RN ~ bN1/2 and relaxation time TN ~ RN/DN ~ N2 /W this reduces for @ = 5/4 to

y =- CN(t)(b3p)/(WDN)=c (Wt)-5/4Nº fort << TN(140)

with c being a dimensionless constant. The bold slope indi- cated in the plot corresponds to a value c = 1. Interestingly, since CN(t)~2hN(t)/2, it follows from Eq. (140) that

hv(1)=6DNt ( 1 + 50c (Wt)-1/4).

As may be seen in Fig. 37 (stars) for N = 8192, Eq. (141) with c = 1 provides an excellent fit of the measured hN (t). We also note that the second term in Eq. (141) dominates the short-time dynamics for t < t* = W-1(16c/9b3 p)4 Nº ~ 103. This is indicated by the vertical arrow in Fig. 37. Hence, for t « t* the stars correspond to a power-law slope with

Fig. 41 Cs (t) for subchains obtained for chains of length N = 1024 using an overlap penalty E = 10 and L26-moves [90]. Main panel: For t « Ts the subchains scale as the total chains in agreement with Eq. (12) as shown by the bold line. For intermediate times Ts << t « IN the sub- chain displacements (1 << s << N) follow the monomer MSD and thus Cs(t) ~ 50(bW)2(Wt)1/2-2 (dash-dotted line). Inset: The latter regime can be better seen by setting Ts = s2 /W and CTs = - (bW)2s-3 and plotting y = Cs(t)/CT, as a function of x = t /Ts. The dashed slope cor- responds to y = 1/8x3/2 for x > 1.

exponent ß = 2-@= (6-d)/4 = 3/4. This is close to the phenomenological exponent B = 0.8 from the literature. The central advantage of computing the VCF CN(t) lies in the fact that it allows us thus to make manifest that (negative algebraic) deviations from the Rouse behavior exist for all times and not just for t << t *.

Returning to our discussion of Fig. 40(a) we emphasize that the VCF of shorter chains decay more rapidly for large times following roughly the exponent @ = 5/2 expected for effective colloids. We verify explicitly in Fig. 40(b) that the bending down of the data is consistent with the announced scaling in terms of a reduced time x = t/TN and a verti- cal axis y = CN(t)/CTy using the amplitude CTN = CN(t = TN) ~- (RN/TN)2p/p ~ - 1/N7/2 stated in Eq. (133). The successful data collapse confirms that the only relevant time scale in this problem is the relaxation time TN for which the deviations for short (@) = 5/4) and long times (@) = 5/2) match. It is worthwhile to emphasize that the general scal- ing Eq. (133) together with the locality of the deviations, CN(t) ~1/N, immediately imply the exponent @. This can be seen by counting the powers of the chain length N,

## -1=(1/2-2)2+(1-d/2)+20, (142)



thus @ = (d+2)/4 = 5/4 in agreement with Eq. (134) and the numerically observed time dependence. Assuming that Eq. (133) holds, the exponents for N and t thus contain the same information.

The VCF Cs(t) for subchains of arc-length s ≤ N is pre- sented in Fig. 41. The subchain VCF Cs(t) is obtained as the total chain VCF CN(t), the only difference being that the CM rs (t) of the subchain defines now the displacement vec- tor u(t)=rs(t+ 8t) - rs(t). The data presented in the main panel is rescaled as in Fig. 40(a) with Ds = 0.009/s setting now the relevant diffusion constant used for the vertical axis.

## 6.3.4 Dynamic coherent form factor

where p1(q,t) = >n=1 exp(-iq · rn) stands for the Fourier transform of the density of a labeled chain. For t = 0 the dynamical form factor F(q,t) reduces to the static form fac- tor F(q) discussed in Sec. 5.7. In the Guinier regime F (q,t) probes the overall chain motion which allows to determine quite generally hN(t) using the expansion [4]

at least if sufficiently precise small angle data are available [78,79]. Thus, y ~ for t < t *. Obviously, Eq. (146) also holds for our numerical data (not shown).

Larger wavevectors (1/RN « q « 1/§) are experimen- tally more readily accessible [5]. Since in this regime the dynamical form factor probes the MSD of subchains of arc- length s ~ 1/q2 with hs (t) replacing hp(t) in Eq. (146) [177], it is of relevance to verify whether it is possible in practice to confirm the exponent ß = 3/4 using the numerically com- puted dynamical form factor. We remind that since in this wavevector regime F(q,t) becomes independent of N, the Rouse model implies the scaling

a rescaled monomer mobility [4]. Using the directly mea- sured mobility W we have I = 0.0072 for the BFM data presented in Fig. 42. As can be seen from the main panel, a satisfactory data collapse is indeed obtained if sufficiently large subchains are probed (q ≤ 21/8). This is consistent with the fact that our systems are to leading order of Rouse- type, especially if large times are probed. The scaling func- tion f(x) indicated by the dashed line has been obtained by integrating numerically the Rouse model prediction [4]

f (x) = 10 8

duexp - x12 h (ux-1/2) with

cos(xu) (1-exp(-x2)) . (149)

Considering that there is no adjustable parameter this fit is satisfactory. Expansion of Eq. (149) for small x yields78

f(x) =1 -x+x3/2 .41/2 3VIT . for x « 1. (150)

Thus, according to the Rouse model one expects the rescaled dynamical form factor y(x) = 1 - F(q,t)/F(q,0) traced in the inset of Fig. 42 to increase (to leading order) as y(x) ~ xB with ß = 1 (dashed line). Instead we find for larger wavevec- tors a power-law increase with exponent ß = 3/4 (bold line) in agreement with the scaling relation

y=q2hs (t) =q2+3/4/s~q4,3/4 (151)

for t << t* « Ts [Eq. (141)].79 In other words, an experimen- tal observation of a power law slope of the reduced dynami- cal structure factor with ß ~ 3/4 would thus confirm scale- free CM displacement correlations with @ = 2 -B ~ 5/4.

78 Note that the approximation f(x) = exp(-2\x/nt) given in [4] is unfortunately wrong. Effective mobilities W determined using this formula are therefore also incorrect [52]. A better approximation tak- ing into account the fluctuations around the saddle point is given by F(x) =(x3x/4)1/4 exp(-2\x/T).

79 That with decreasing wavevector the data approaches systemati- cally the Rouse prediction B = 1 is expected (i) since for the same value x = q4T't a smaller wavevector q corresponds to a larger time t and (ii) since for t >t* ~ SONO the colored noise becomes masked by the white forces, Eq. (141).

Fig. 43 Robustness of the scaling of CN(t) [90]. Data obtained for N = 1024 using L26-moves is shown for (a) various overlap penal- ties ¿ at volume fraction ø = 0.5 and (b) various volume fractions ø at overlap penalty € = 10. For sufficiently large times (but still t << TN) all data appears to collapse on the same asymptotic power-law expo- nent @ = 5/4 (bold line) for incompressible polymer solutions. The statistics deteriorates with decreasing & and p and additional physics is visible at short times.

## 6.4 Compressibility effects



Up to now we have focused on one working point at over- lap penalty ¿ = 10 and volume fraction Ø = 0.5, i.e. all data corresponds to the same static properties, especially to the same dimensionless compressibility g = 0.32. It is natural to ask how the observed scaling changes with the compress- ibility of the solution. Our key scaling relation Eq. (133) cor- responding to an incompressible packing of blobs does in fact only depend implicitly on g. This suggest that Eq. (140) for times t « TN should also remain valid if one uses for rescaling of the axes the effective bond length b, the mobil- ity W and the diffusion constant DN measured independently for the given operational parameters ¿ and ø. This is in fact borne out for the asymptotic behavior of the rescaled VCFs displayed in Fig. 43(a) for different overlap penalties ¿ at ¢ = 0.5 and in Fig. 43(b) for different volume fraction ¢ at ¿ = 10. (We only display chains with N = 1024 to avoid the colloidal regime for t >> TN.) The values used for the rescaling of the axes are listed in Table 1 for the variation of the overlap penalty and in Table 2 for different volume fractions.

Fig. 44 Dynamical correlations for 3D BFM melts at volume fraction ¢ = 0.5 obtained using L06-moves: (a) VCF CN(t) for E = 10 focusing on larger chains with N > 256. Using W = 0.002 and DN = 0.007/N we rescale the data as in Fig. 40(a). This allows to collapse the data on the same power-law slope (bold line) as obtained using L26-moves, Eq. (140). (b) Topology induced additional correlations for chains of length N = 8192. Main panel: MSD hN(t) vs. time t comparing L26- moves for € = 10 (spheres) to L06-moves for different overlap penal- ties E. Topological constraints become important for L06-moves with ¿ >> 10 and, as expected from reptation theory for times larger than the entanglement time Te ~ 105 [4], the data bends towards a power-law exponent 1/2 (dashed line). Inset: The reduced VCF -CN(t)N con- firms that for all system classes the short-time dynamics is described by the power-law exponent @ = 5/4 (bold line).

panel (b) demonstrates explicitly that CN(t) ~ 1/b3p if one scales out the additional variation of the monomer mobility W(ø). We remind that this density dependence stems orig- inally from the factor px/p in Eq. (133) due to the corre- lation hole forces setting the repulsion between chains and subchains which drive the dynamical correlations. That the data deviates for short time from Eq. (140) is to be expected qualitatively since the incompressibility constraint is only felt by the chains if the dynamics is probed on a scale cor- responding to the static screening length. As we have seen in Sec. 5.4, a similar crossover is observed for static proper- ties such as the angular correlation function [86]. At present we are still lacking a detailed description for the short time dynamical behavior and how to match it with the correlated motion of incompressible blobs at long times.

## 6.5 L06-moves and effects of topological constraints



Up to now we have deliberately tuned our model to avoid topological constraints. Obviously, these constraints are ex- pected to matter for the dynamics of real 3D polymer melts [3,4]. It is thus of interest to see how the presented picture changes if topology is again switched on using the topology conserving L06-moves of the classical BFM [50,51,56].

Obviously, for small penalties the dynamics remains of Rouse-type as can be seen from Fig. 44(a) for the same static conditions ($ = 0.5,€ = 10) as in Sec. 6.3. One determines readily a local mobility W = 0.002 and a self-diffusion co- efficient DN = 0.007/N, i.e. the dynamics is slightly slower than for the larger L26-moves. If using these parameters CN(t) is rescaled as shown in Fig. 40(a), all data sets collapse perfectly on the same slope as for L26-moves (bold line). This is consistent with the idea that the scaling Eq. (140) only depends implicitly on the specific MC moves used.

Preliminary data comparing L26-moves and L06-moves for chains of length N = 8192 and higher overlap penalties is presented in Fig. 44(b). With increasing & the crossing of the chains gets more improbable for L06-moves and the topological constraints become more relevant. This can be seen for ¿ = 30 and even more for ¿ = 100. The latter data set approaches the slope 1/2 (dashed line) expected from reptation theory for times larger than the entanglement time Te [4]. The vertical arrow indicates a value for Te obtained from an analysis of the monomer displacements h(t) [56]. Apart from the much larger chain length N = 8192 used, the data for ¿ = 100 is consistent with the results obtained using the classical BFM ( = 0) [51,56]. As in Fig. 37 the bold line represents the exponent ß = 0.8 [51,79]. Superficially, it does a better job for systems with conserved topology due to the broad crossover to the entangled regime. How- ever, that this empirical exponent is by no means deep as revealed by the VCF CN(t) plotted in the inset. For short times all systems with and without topology conservation are well-described by the same exponent @ = 5/4 (bold line) in agreement with the proposed deviations from the Rouse model, Eq. (134). Note that the last points given for € = 100 decay slightly more rapidly. Unfortunately, the length of the analyzed time series does currently not allow us to verify whether our data become consistent with the decay

CN()= = (+) (+)

-3/2 fort > Te

(152)

expected for reptating chains with de ~ Te being the tube diameter [3]. Much longer time series, just as for the L26- moves with ¿ = 10 we have focused on, are currently under production to clarify this issue. The numerical demonstra- tion is challenging, since the difference between the expo- nents, 3/2 - 5/4 = 1/4, is rather small and several orders of magnitude in time are needed to discriminate the power laws. In any case it is thus due to the dynamical correlations first seen in the BFM simulations of Paul et al. [51, 79] that the crossover between Rouse and reptation regimes becomes broader and more difficult to describe than suggested by the

standard Rouse-reptation theory [3,4] which does not take into account the (static and dynamical) correlations imposed by the incompressibility constraint.

## 6.6 Perturbation calculation predictions



## 6.6.1 Colored collective forces



Focusing now on the short-time correlations (t << TN) in d- dimensional polymer melts without topological constraints, we present now a linear response calculation to describe the coupling between the degrees of freedom of a tagged test chain and the degrees of freedom of the collective bath char- acterized, respectively, by the dynamical form factor F (q,t) and the dynamical structure factor S(q,t) at equilibrium. The underlying physics is that the displacement of a test chain at t = 0 creates a free energy perturbation of the bath which decays by collective diffusion but survives at intermediate times. The collective force f (t) associated with the pertur- bation of the molecular field pushes the test chain towards its original position at t = 0" causing thus the anomalous dif- fusion of the CM motion demonstrated numerically above. We remind first that the forces acting on the CM IN(t) of an a priori Rouse chain may be written [4]

=f.(t) = f.(t)+f.(t), (153)

dt drN(t)

i.e. in addition to the random white force f (t) of the stan- dard Rouse model we have to account for the force f (t) from the molecular field. The friction coefficient & may be obtained using Eq. (148) from the effective monomer mo- bility W. According to the relation Eq. (176) given in Ap- pendix A, the VCF CN(t) of the chain CM is given by

CN(t) =- 1 (NS)2

f c

for t > 0, (154)

c

i.e. our task is to compute the correlation of the collective force f (t) due to the molecular field surrounding the ref- erence chain. The negative sign corresponds to the fact that the collective forces push the reference chain back towards its original position, just as for the overdamped colloids.

## 6.6.2 Dynamical random phase approximation



As already discussed in Sec. 6.3.4, the degrees of freedom of the test chain are encoded by the dynamical form factor F(q,t), Eq. (145). As seen from the main panel of Fig. 42, the scaling F(q,t) = F(q,0)f(x) with x = q4It is nicely obeyed for not too large wavevectors, although deviations from the Rouse prediction are visible for small x. Since these deviations are small, it is justified in the spirit of a perturba- tion calculation to assume that Eq. (149) holds for all wave- vectors q > 1/RN and times t << TN.

The degrees of freedom of the bath are described by the dynamical collective structure factor

S(q,t) =< p(q,t)p(q,0)}/(pv)

Data obtained from BFM simulations (open symbols) are com- pared to the theoretical prediction, Eq. (158), indicated by the bold line [91]. In agreement with theory we find a good scaling collapse if y(x) = S(q,t)F(q)/S2(q) is plotted as a function of the reduced time x= q4Tt with I obtained independently from the monomer mobility W, Eq. (148). Deviations from the Rouse model prediction are visible for small x, i.e. for short times t << t*, in agreement with Fig. 42.

where f(z) and §(z) stand, respectively, for the Laplace trans- form of the scaling functions f(x) and §(x). Assuming for f(x) the Rouse model prediction, Eq. (149), this yields for y(x)=S(q,t)F(q)/S2(q) the bold line presented in Fig. 45. Taking apart deviations for small x, i.e. for small times, we obtain a nice scaling collapse for the BFM data presented in Fig. 45, especially considering that there is no free fit param- eter available. We note finally that since for the wavevectors used S(q) ~ g = 1/(vp), it follows from Eq. (158) that

## 6.6.3 Lowest-order perturbation



with p(q,t) = >n=1 nlmon exp (-iq . Ln(t)) being the Fourier trans- form of the collective monomer density. For t = 0 Eq. (155) reduces to the static structure factor S(q) analyzed in Sec. 4.4. The dynamical structure factor cannot be devised using the Rouse theory alone, for S(q,t) encodes the collective be- havior of the chains, a cooperativity destroyed by the as- sumptions underlying the Rouse approach. Fortunately, to deal with this question the "dynamical Random Phase Ap- proximation" (dRPA) is a valuable tool which provides sen- sible predictions for S(q,t) [112,113,91]. Similarly to the static RPA discussed in Sec. 4.4, the dRPA is based on a self-consistent closure of a mean-field theory: upon a per- turbation by an external field, the response of a polymer is assumed to be the combination of a direct response to the field plus a response mediated by the environment of other chains, which are also subjected to the external field. This autocoherent reasoning leads to a prediction for $(q,z), the Laplace transform of S(q,t), given by [91]

z§(q,z) - S(q) =

1+ pvF(q) [F(q)-zf(q,z)] zÊ (q,z) - F (q)

(156)

A collective density fluctuation 8p corresponds to a molec- ular field vop driving the monomers of the test chain with a force -TvVôp. The lowest order force correlation cor- responds to the following mechanism: the test chain inter- acts with the collective field at time 0 and again at time t. Using the densities p1(q,t) and p(q,t) of the test chain and the bath in Fourier space defined above, the collective force f.(t) may be rewritten as

f(t) = Tv | dªq (2) d (iq)p1 (q,t) p(q,t).

(160)

The correlation f(+) . f.(0) for t > 0 becomes thus after lowest-order factorization

T

Using the dynamical form and structure factors, Eq. (145) and Eq. (155), this yields

f.(t) . f(0) =T2Np| dª q (2T) d

-v2q'F(q,t)S(q,t). (162)

with v = 1/pg being the effective monomer excluded vol- ume and Ê (q, z) the Laplace transform of the dynamical form factor F(q,t). For z = 0, i.e. by summing over all times t, this equation yields of course the static RPA S(q)-1 = F(q)-1 + vp discussed in Sec. 4.4. Using this limit one may rewrite Eq. (156) which yields the dRPA formula

Using Eq. (154) and Eq. (159) the VCF becomes

dª q

CN(t) = T2 - (2 T) d qª(x)Ã(x). (163)

Since f(x) and §(x) decrease rapidly for x >> 1, the integral is well-behaved. After substituting the friction coefficients and I by W, Eq. (148), this may be rewritten as

Hence, Eq. (164) confirms finally the scaling announced in Eq. (133) and Eq. (134). The coefficient ca is given by

Cd = VTt (4d / VTT) d/2 1 dax -x2f(x)5(x) (165)

(2T) d

which may be computed numerically [91]. For 3D melts (d = 3) we find c3 ~ 0.42. This is of the same order but slightly lower as the empirical coefficient c ~ 1 estimated from Fig. 40. Where this small difference comes from is cur- rently still an unresolved question. One possibility is that the single loop approximation presented here - especially as- suming Eq. (149) and Eq. (158) for small x - is not suffi- cient and higher order terms should be considered. Another (physically more appealing) option is that only about half of the free energy is stored in the longitudinal composition fluctuations and that the transverse stress due to the shear- ing of the bath at constant density generates an additional contribution to the correlations of same magnitude [91,93].

with St being the (arbitrary) time window used to define the displacements. Since subchains repel each other due to the incompressibility constraint, a tagged subchain is pulled back to its original position by the subchain dipole field. Since for times &t Kt « TN the relevant dipole field decays much slower than for colloids (x = 1/2 -> 1/4), the correla- tions are much more pronounced. That our scaling relations for t « TN do not depend explicitly on the compressibility of the solution, as stated by Eq. (133), has been checked by the systematic variation of excluded volume penalty ¿ and volume fraction ø [90]. As shown for melts with topological constraints the early-time behavior, CN(t) ~ - N-1t-5/4, is preserved before entanglement effects set in which leads to a broad crossover between Rouse and reptation regimes. As shown in Sec. 6.6, our scaling approach is consistent with a standard linear response calculation. En passant we have verified the so-called "dynamical Random Phase Approxi- mation" for the collective dynamical response of the bath surrounding the reference chain (Fig. 45) [91].

## 6.7 Summary



Focusing on a variant of the BFM algorithm with topology non-conserving moves we investigated the effective dynam- ical forces acting on the chains and subchains imposed by the incompressibility constraint. Sampling chain lengths up to N = 8192 allowed us to carefully check the N-dependence of deviations with respect to the Rouse model. Such devia- tions are visible from the short-time scaling of the CM MSD hN(t) in agreement with the literature, however, a more pre- cise characterization can be achieved by means of the CM VCF CN(t)~ a2hN(t)/2 which allows to probe directly the correlated random forces, Eq. (154). How such a VCF can be computed within a MC scheme has been first illustrated for dense BFM beads (Fig. 36) confirming the negative al- gebraic decay expected for overdamped colloids, Eq. (132). The observed exponent @ = (d+2)« with a = 1/2 can be understood by the coupling of a tagged colloid to the gra- dient of the collective density field decaying in time. As shown in Fig. 40(b), the same exponents are relevant for polymer chains for large times (t >> TN) where the chains behave as effective colloids. More importantly, the short- time deviations for hN(t) have been traced back to the neg- ative analytic decay CN(t) ~ - N-It-@ fort << TN with an exponent @ ~5/4. That CN(t) decays inversely with mass shows that the process is local, i.e. the displacement corre- lations of subchains of arc-length s add up independently (Fig. 41). Assuming according to the postulated scaling re- lation Eq. (133) the chain relaxation time IN to be the only characteristic time scale, both asymptotic regimes can be brought to a successful data collapse. The @-exponents for short times proposed in Eq. (134) are consistent with the crossover scaling, Eq. (133), and the locality of the corre- lations (CN(t) ~ 1/N) which implies @ = (d+2)/4. This scaling can be understood by the generalization of the above- mentioned correlation experienced by overdamped colloids to the displacement field of subchains of length s ~ 8t1/2

## 7 Conclusion



## 7.1 Summary



Until very recently it has been generally assumed that all long-range static and dynamical correlations are negligible in dense 3D solutions of flexible homopolymers beyond the excluded volume screening length § ~ g1/2 which character- izes the decay of the density fluctuations [2,3,4, 8]. For static properties this general screening assumption leads to Flory's ideality hypothesis (Sec. 1.3) [2,4] stating that the chains must obey Gaussian chain statistics. For the equilibrium dy- namics it implies Rouse model dynamics (Sec. 1.4) if in ad- dition momentum conservation ("hydrodynamic screening") and topological constraints [4] may be neglected or are de- liberately switched off as one can readily do in a computer experiment using local MC hopping moves (Sec. 3.3.1).

That some deviations from Flory's ideality hypothesis must exist has been suggested in earlier work by de Gennes [3, 114], Obukhov [69], Duplantier [178], Schäfer et al. [7, 71] or Semenov and Johner [94]. For instance, it has been known for a long time [3] that due to the incompressibility constraint an entropic penalty ux ~ Px/p set by the correla- tion hole self-density px ~ N/Ry has to be paid for bringing two chains of length N close to each other (Fig. 3). In the large-N limit this effect must become negligible in d = 3, however. That the dynamics of polymer melts without rel- evant topological interactions may deviate from the Rouse model has been pointed out in various theoretical, computa- tional and experimental studies by Schweizer [175], Guenza et al. [99] or Paul et al. [51,77] as summarized in Ref. [79]. However, since topological and hydrodynamical effects have not been systematically separated from the incompressibil- ity constraint [99] - with the notable exception of the BFM simulations of Shaffer [54,55] - it has been difficult to pin-

point the precise physical origin of the key finding observed for the MSD hN(t) of the chain CM, Eq. (13).

Summarizing recent theoretical and computational re- sults we have argued in the present contribution that due to the incompressibility constraint both static [80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89] and dynamical [90,91] correlations of the composition fluctuations, i.e. of the density and displace- ment fields of marked chains and subchains, must arise for distances r >> § and for corresponding arc-lengths s » g. Since the applied constraint is scale-free, the resulting cor- relations are also scale-free - taken apart the usual upper and lower cutoffs set by the chain and the monomer size - and do not depend explicitly on the dimensionless com- pressibility g of the solution (Sec. 2.3). The central point stressed by us [81] is that not only chains but also subchains of arbitrary length s must repel each other due to the incom- pressibility constraint and this with a penalty us ~ s/pR being for s « N much larger than the penalty ux between the chains (Fig. 4). Since subchains repel each other and this with a strength decreasing with s in d = 3, the chains become weakly swollen as discussed in Sec. 5. Our study shows that a polymer in dense solutions should not be viewed as one soft sphere (or ellipsoid) [123, 124,99], but as a hierarchy of nested segmental correlation holes of all sizes aligned and correlated along the chain backbone [Fig. 3(b)].80 The effec- tive interaction between subchains has also dynamical con- sequences since a subchain displaced at t = 0 causing thus a perturbation of the subchain density field (Fig. 35) will be slightly pushed back by the bath to its original position (Sec. 6).

In this review we have focused on numerical results ob- tained by means of a BFM variant with finite monomer in- teractions without topological constraints (Fig. 6). Since this "soft BFM" is fully ergodic (in contrast to the classical BFM) and very efficient due to its implementation as a Potts spin model [86], it may be an interesting alternative to various popular coarse-grained simulation approaches with self-con- sistently calculated effective pair interactions [123, 124, 99, 180, 166]. Our study has not been limited to monodisperse polymers but we have also investigated (essentially) Flory- distributed EP [81,83,87,88]. Since in these systems chains break and recombine constantly (Fig. 9) equilibration and sampling become much faster than for their monodisperse counterparts. This is computationally of interest since the numerical demonstration of the various theoretical predic- tions requires the sampling of large chain lengths to avoid additional chain end effects.

The deviations from the screening assumption are in- deed scale-free as made manifest by the numerical obser- vation of the analytic decay of various correlation functions. As announced by Eq. (11), it has been shown in Sec. 5 that the bond-bond correlation function PI(s) ~ a2R2 decays as P1(s) ~ +1/sd/2 for s « N and d = 3. That these correla- tions are long-ranged is made explicit by the power-law de- cay of the bond-bond correlation function P1(r) ~ +1/rd

80 Similar deviations from Flory's ideality hypothesis have been re- ported recently for polymer gels and networks [139, 179].

as a function of the monomer distance r (Sec. 5.4.2). As a second key result of this study, the displacement correlation function CN(t) ~ a22hN(t) is shown to reveal for short times t « IN a negative algebraic decay according to NCN(t) ~ -1/t(d+2)/4 as predicted by scaling arguments and pertur- bation theory (Sec. 6). As stated by Eq. (12), this analytic decay holds more generally for the displacement correla- tion function Cs(t) of subchains of length s ≤ N and times t << Ts ~ s2 /W, Fig. 41, which shows that the correlations of different subchains add up independently to the correlations of the total chain ("locality").

Note that earlier computational studies have focused on (second and higher) moments of the generalized displace- ment field under consideration such as the mean-squared size R2 of subchains of arc-length s [73] or the CM MSD hN(t) [51] and have thus only probed indirectly the respec- tive colored forces, Eq. (176), corresponding to the devia- tions from the general screening assumption.81 Computing numerically correlation functions such as P1(s) or CN(t), rather than twice their integral, allows to probe directly the colored forces, Eq. (176), without having to subtract first the white noise and the local physics which contribute both to R2 and hN(t). As a consequence, this allows to demonstrate that the deviations from the screening assumption are not due to (non-universal) physics at the lower cutoff but, in fact, are present for all arc-length s (Fig. 25) and all times t (Fig. 40).

## 7.2 Related questions and outlook



## 7.2.1 Confined polymer melts



In the presented numerical work we have focused on 3D polymer bulks (d = 3). It has been shown that even the devi- ations with respect to the general screening assumption are well-described by means of one-loop perturbation calcula- tions (Sec. 2, Sec. 6.6) and this for arbitrarily long chains and subchains. As already noted in Sec. 1.1, the success of the mean-field approach is expected due to the scaling of the (sub)chain self-density p /p ~ s1-dv, i.e. the number of subchains a reference subchain interacts with increases as p/p* ~ > 1 ind = 3. Due to the increasing experi- mental interest on mechanical and rheological properties of nanoscale systems in general [181] and on polymer melts confined to surfaces, thin slits (d = 2) or capillaries (d = 1) Self-avoiding melts in strictly one and two dimensions correspond to rather specific universality classes [94,192, 193,96]. Since systems of strictly one monomer layer thick- ness at high volume fractions remain experimentally a chal- lenge [184, 188], it is of interest to relax the non-crossing in particular [182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190] one is naturally led to question theoretically such mean-field cal- culations for systems of reduced (effective) dimension [114, 178,94,96, 191, 192, 193]. Especially, the perturbations to chainconstraint by either allowing some finite monomer overlap dynamics due to geometric constraints remain a challenge of significant technological relevance with opportunities rang- ing from tribology to biology [182, 183, 185, 187].

Strictly 1D and 2D self-avoiding polymer melts (€ = 0) are known to become compact and segregated with g* ~ 1 and are thus not Gaussian beyond the monomer scale. While the 1D case is trivial, it should be noted that for strictly 2D melts compactness means v = 1/d = 1/2 [3]. This does of course not imply ideal chain behavior since other crit- ical exponents characterizing the chain conformations dif- fer from those of non-interacting Gaussian chains as shown in the pioneering work by Duplanier [178]. For instance, since 02 = 3/4 [178] this implies that the compact 2D chains have a fractal perimeter of dimension ds = d - 02 = 5/4 [94]. This theoretical prediction has been verified numeri- cally [119, 120, 118] from the scaling of the chain perimeter (determined by "box counting" [19]) and of the form factor shown to be consistent with Eq. (166).

Note that for ideal chain systems with d ≤ 1/v = 2 the self-density på ultimately exceeds the density p at a charac- teristic chain length g* which depends on the specific prob- lem considered. For (sub)chains larger than this length g* one expects the chains to adopt compact and segregated con- formations, i.e. Flory's exponent v is given by the spatial di- mension, v = 1/d [19]. Since these compact structures arise ultimately due to the scale-free incompressibility constraint, their surfaces are expected not to be ruled by a finite sur- face tension (which would imply a length scale) [94,118] but to be also scale-free and described by a fractal surface exponent ds ≤ d [19]. In most cases of interest the surface exponent becomes ds = d - 02 [118], i.e. it is set by the well-known contact exponent 02 describing the scaling of the distribution G(r,s) ~ rez for short distances r < Rs be- tween two monomers n and m = n +s on a chain. (Obviously, 02 = 0 for Gaussian chains, Eq. (2).) According to the gen- eralized Porod law the intramolecular structure factor F (q) of such compact objects scales as

F(q)/N~ 1/(RNq)2d-ds (166)

in the intermediate range of the wavevector q [5, 194, 118]. If ds <2d -2, i.e. 02 > 2 - d, the standard Kratky representa- tion reveals thus a much more pronounced non-monotonous behavior as for the 3D melts discussed in Sec. 5.7.82

81 In line with Appendix A we view here the bond vectors L of a chain conformation as displacement vectors with the monomer index i playing the role of time.

82 Incidentally, melts of non-concatenated rings in d = 3 have been argued to become "marginally compact" with v = 1/d = 1/3 and ds -> d = 3, i.e. the form factor is predicted to scale as F(q)q2 ~ 1/q [118, 195] in the large-N limit. That the rings should adopt compact configurations is expected due to the mutual repulsion caused by the topological constraints [132, 121, 133, 168, 196, 197, 198, 122, 199, 195,

penalty ¿ (Sec. 3.4) or by considering chains confined to capillaries or slits between parallel walls of finite distance H as in Fig. 6(c). Note that g* ~ (aH2 p)2 ~ H4 for melts con- fined to a 1D capillary of finite width H as already shown by Brochard and de Gennes in 1979 [114] and g* is known to increase even exponentially with H for essentially 2D ultra- thin films [94]. Since g* becomes thus rapidly large, pertur- bation results, such as the scaling of the bond-bond correla- tion function P1(s) stated in Eq. (11), must become relevant for finite (sub)chain lengths. A lower limit of validity g of the d-dimensional perturbation calculation is set for systems with finite overlap penalty by g+ ~ g and (sub)chains con- fined to capillaries or slits of finite width should be larger than g+ ~ H2, otherwise the chains do not "feel" the wall constraint and behave as in the 3D bulk.

Let us focus now on effectively 2D films of width H [136, 137,95,97] as shown in Fig. 46. Note that all properties considered here are the 2D projection of the 3D observables. The relevant density is, e.g., the projected number density P2 = Hp = 0.25 and the indicated bond length b = 2.65 is the projection of the effective bond length of the 3D melt. Since the width H = 4 used here is much smaller than the typical subchain size Rs considered, i.e. s >> g+ ~ 1, these systems can be regarded as effectively d = 2+ dimensional for all s and N. (We write d = 2+ to stress that monomer overlap and chain crossings are allowed.) Since also g* » s one expects the perturbation result for the bond-bond cor- relation function P1(s) ~ 1/s® with @ = d/2 = 1 to yield

200, 118]. Since there is no obvious reason for a finite surface tension, the surface must become fractal which may be determined both in ex- periment as in a computer simulation by the generalized Porod law of the form factor. A marginally compact structure allows to keep all monomers evenly exposed to the topological constraints imposed by other rings, i.e. all subsegments of the rings are thus ruled in a self- similar manner by the same statistics. Such behavior is known for var- ious biological systems, such as the lungs of mammals, attempting to maximize the surface at constant overall embedding volume [201].

a reasonable fit to the measured data for all s «< N. This is indeed borne out nicely for the data presented in the inset. According to Eq. (4) this implies that R3 /s and Ry/N must increase logarithmically with, respectively, s and N. This can be checked directly as seen in Ref. [95]. The same paper also investigates the form factor F (q) for different H. It is shown that q2 F (q) becomes systematically more non-monotonous with decreasing width H, i.e. the more p/p increases.

We turn now to the dynamics of BFM melts confined to thin slits of width H = 4 sampled using local topology non-conserving L26-moves as in Sec. 6.3 [97]. It can be demonstrated that to leading order the dynamics remains consistent with the Rouse model, especially Eq. (5).83 As before, we obtain from the monomer MSD h(t) a local mo- bility, W ~0.002. That the self-diffusion coefficient scales as DN ~0.005/N can be seen by tracing NhN(t)/2dt in log- linear coordinates. (Note that W and DN are consistent with Eq. (137).) Systematic deviations are again revealed by the short-time behavior of the MSDs hN(t) and hs(t) of chains and subchains (not shown). These deviations are, however, much more pronounced than in 3D and are visible over time scales up to the total chain relation time TN. A more precise characterization of the colored forces acting on the chains is again achieved by means of the VCF CN(t) which is repre- sented in the main panel of Fig. 46. The representation cho- sen is similar to Fig. 40(a) for the bulk case; the factor b3 p being replaced by b2 p2. The faster decay observed for the shorter chains at t >> TN is described by the exponent @ = (2+d)/4 = 2 (dashed line) expected for 2D overdamped colloids, Eq. (132). As may be seen from the collapse for short times (t << TN), the VCF scales again as CN(t) ~ 1/N, i.e. the colored forces are again local.84 In agreement with Eq. (134) or Eq. (142) the VCF is observed to decay alge- braically with an exponent @ = (d+2)/4 = 1 (bold line). Since CN(t)~ a2hN(t)/2 it follows that hN(t) /t is not con- stant but must increase logarithmically for all times t << TN. In analogy to Eq. (141) for the bulk case this thus explains the observed deviations from the Rouse model.

We note finally that qualitatively similar results consis- tent with Eq. (11) and Eq. (134) are also found in prelim- inary BFM simulations of polymer melts confined to thin capillaries with a square-section of width H = 8 << RN and a broad range of overlap penalties ¿.

## 7.2.2 Interchain correlations and anti-Casimir forces



The presented work has focused on intrachain properties such as the bond-bond correlation function P1(s). The main reason for this is that the power-law exponents associated

83 Since in thin films the ratio Ry/N diverges logarithmically with N [94,95, 154] and since TN ~ Ry/DN still holds, there are some (rather weak) logarithmic corrections to Eq. (5) as discussed in [97].

84 Note that a different scaling, CN(t) ~ 1/VN, has been reported in a study of strictly 2D polymer melts sampled by MD simulation us- ing a standard Langevin thermostat [177]. The correlations of the CM motion are argued to become non-local in this special limit due to the "constant surface constraint" of the compact and segregated subchains.

Fig. 47 The presented studies focused on intrachain properties which are numerically more readily accessible than the long-range interchain correlations associated to the "anti-Casimir" forces [18, 115]. The two panels indicate two possibilities to probe such correlations for EP melts confined to thin slits: (a) A weak external field conjugated to the bond direction is applied to the bonds in a thin slap of width 8: The sec- ond Legendre polynomial P2(r) characterizing the orientation of the bonds with respect to the direction perpendicular to the slap and the force f(r) experienced by a colloid placed at a distance r should decay analytically with not too large exponents. (b) EP in grand-canonical contact with a large bath: The difference of, e.g., the densities of the confined system and the bath decays analytically with H.

to the intrachain static and dynamical deviations due to the incompressibility constraint are not too large being thus nu- merically still accessible with reasonable computational ef- fort. In fact, similar correlations have been predicted the- oretically also for interchain properties [18, 115] which for macroscopic thermodynamic and mechanical properties may even be more relevant. Note that for these interchain corre- lations it is not only the incompressibility constraint which matters but in addition the constraint that closed loops are disallowed and must be eliminated from an extended grand- canonical ensemble containing both linear chains and rings, as shown by Obukhov and Semenov [18, 115]. The "throw- ing-away" of configurations is argued to generate additional entropic forces repelling, e.g., two large colloids immersed in a linear-chain polymer melt. Unfortunately, these "anti- Casimir forces" correspond to such strong exponents as a function of distance r or wavevector q (similar to the stan- dard van der Waals forces [20]) that, at present, it has turned out to be elusive to verify them numerically although a brave attempt has been made by means of off-lattice MC simula- tions [202]. Following this recent work, we sketch in Fig. 47 two possibilities which might allow to probe correlations due to the no-loop constraint by means of EP melts confined to thin slits. The use of EP instead of monodisperse chains should speed up the sampling of independent configurations while confining the monomers reduces the exponents of the various analytic scaling relations predicted. For instance, the second Legendre polynomial P2(r), measuring the orienta- tion of the bonds at a distance r from a small region where an external field weakly aligns the bond vectors, should decay as P2(x) ~ ~~ 5 with 8 = 2 for d = 2+ as illustrated in panel (a) of Fig. 47. If successful these simulations may stimulate real micro-mechanical experiments using optical tweezers aligning bond vectors and repelling thus nearby colloids.

## 7.2.3 Dynamical properties beyond MC stochastics



We have checked by means of MD simulations of a bead- spring model [91,92] that CN(t) ~ - N-1t-5/4 for t << TN holds as long as a large friction constant y is used for the Langevin thermostat applied [24]. Concerning the power- law amplitude it should be noted, however, that the coef- ficient c determined from the data using Eq. (140) is much larger for these MD simulations (c/c3 ~ 20) compared to our BFM result (c/c3 ~ 2). As we have pointed out in Sec. 6.6, small differences of order one to the predicted value c3 = 0.42 are expected due to the approximations made in the one-loop perturbation theory, especially since the forces as- sociated to the shear stress may not be properly accounted for [91]. However, the much larger ratio c/c3 found for our MD simulations points to additional physics related to the screening of the monomer momentum in these strongly in- teracting viscoelastic systems [92,93].85 Since our BFM and MD simulations correspond to different model systems, it is currently not possible to clarify this issue. In the future we plan to address this problem using a generic (off-lattice) bead-spring Hamiltonian with soft beads and large springs such as, e.g., the model used by Spenley [68] since we re- quire a model which is (i) essentially incompressible (g « 1), (ii) without having too much useless local structure (as for the Lennard-Jones beads used in [91,92,93]), (iii) does not conserve topology and (iv) can be used for different dy- namical methods such that we can compare the melt dynam- ics under the same static conditions. For such a model one should then compare the dynamics obtained by means of

· MD simulation with a strong Langevin thermostat [24];

. local MC moves of the monomers [26];

· BD simulation in the sense of a "position Langevin equa- tion" where the momentum variables are dropped from the equations of motion [22,203].

The BD method has the advantage that one needs not to in- ject strong random forces as for MD to get rid of the mo- mentum to get closer to the overdamped motion assumption implicit to theory [91]. We expect to obtain for the MC and BD simulations similar ratios c/c3 ~ 2 as for our BFM study.

Interestingly, much stronger dynamical correlations are revealed [92] in MD simulations using a weak Langevin thermostat (Y -> 0) or a momentum conserving "Dissipa- tive Particle Dynamics" (DPD) thermostat [204,24]. As ex- pected from the hydrodynamic screening assumption [4], the chains are described to leading order by the Rouse model, i.e. Eqs. (136), (137) or (149) hold. However, it is shown that some long-range correlations arise due to an intricate coupling of hydrodynamics (momentum conservation) and the (transverse) viscoelastic response of the bath following the displacement of a reference chain.86 As a consequence,

85 The beads bounce into each other on time scales much shorter than 1/y. Kicks due to conservative or random forces can thus propagate through the system before the thermostat has time to do its job.

86 Note the analogy to the static excluded volume screening dis- cussed in Sec. 2. Although the chains are essentially described in d = 3 by Gaussian chain statistics, not all long-range correlations vanish.

even the VCF Cs (t) of subchains for t « Ts depends now ex- plicitly on the total chain length N, i.e. the correlations are non-local with CN(t) ~ 1/VN as suggested by the Zimm model. Since the scaling is still described by Eq. (133) this implies an exponent @ = 3/2 for short times. Hence,

which is the central formula real experimental data should be compared with. Although the VCF decays now more rapidly in time, it is stronger than the VCF for perfectly overdamped melts, since the N-dependence in Eq. (167) is weaker. Note that att ~ IN both mechanisms become of the same magni- tude: CN(TN) ~1/N7/2. Using the same bead-spring model mentioned above it would now be of high interest to sample the dynamical response using

## . a DPD thermostat following the work by Spenley [68].



Obviously, these issues are clearly outside the realm of stan- dard MC based stochastics which shows their limitations.

## A Displacement correlations



Let x(n) denote a (real valued) stochastic variable in some vector space with n being a discrete or continuous index characterizing this variable. Examples are the position r; of the monomers of a given chain as a function of the monomer index i (Fig. 1)87 or the center-of-mass (CM) position IN (t) of a chain of length N as a function of a time t measured by the discrete number of Monte Carlo Steps (MCS). We assume trans- lational invariance of ensemble averaged properties with respect to n, i.e. properties such as the "mean-square displacement" (MSD)

h(n)=h(n1=no+n,no)={(x(n1)-x(no))2> (168)

only depend on the difference n = n1 - no ≥ 0 and not on the abso- lute indices no or n1. Taking advantage of the translational invariance, the ensemble average ( ... ) is often sampled over all available pairs of indices (n1 = no +n,no) for a given n. Examples for MSDs ob- tained as "gliding averages" are the typical segment size R2 presented in Sec. 5.3.2 or the MSD h(t) of BFM beads (N = 1) discussed in Sec. 6.2. In this review we consider essentially Fickian stochastic pro- cesses where the associated generalized MSDs are to leading order proportional to time n, Eq. (3) or Eq. (6). Since the deviations with respect to the Fickian behavior are small, it is important to sample di- rectly correlation functions corresponding to higher derivatives of h(n) with respect to time.

Since we have to deal with indices n which may be either discrete or continuous, let us introduce the (forward) difference operator An [44] defined by A,f(n) = f(n+on) - f(n) with f(n) being a function

87 This monomer index i may be either a discrete (as in our study) or a continuous variable as, e.g., in Refs. [180, 166].

53

of our vector space and on an arbitrary (typically) small shift of n. Let us define the "velocity vector"

Summing up over all contributions and using Eq. (175) it follows C(n) = - 5-2 (fc(n) - fc (0)} for n > 0, (176) i.e. the displacement correlation function probes directly the correla- tions of the colored force fc(n). This general result is used in Sec. 6.6 for the motion of the chain CM with time t but does also apply for the monomer position r; as a function of the monomer index i where the bond-bond correlation function P1 (s) measures the colored forces act- ing on the chain. It should be stressed, however, that in this case the forces noted in Eq. (174) do not correspond directly to the standard forces acting on the monomers in real time.

(169)

associated to x(n) and the "velocity correlation function" (VCF) C(n)=C(n1=no+n,no) = (v(n1=no+n).v(no)>

(170)

which measures the correlations of two velocities v(no) and v(n1). C(n) automatically vanishes if both vectors are uncorrelated. Note that C(n) is a four-point correlation function with respect to n depending in gen- eral on the shift on of the index. If on > n both displacements become trivially correlated and we have limn-+0C(n) = h(on)/on2 > 0. To see how h(t) and C(n) are related for n >> On let us apply twice the differ- ence operator to Eq. (168). This yields

Any Ang (x(1)-x(no)2) =- 2(v(n1) · v(no) Sn2

(171)

where we have used that the difference operator and the averaging pro- cedure commute. Since the MSD h(t) can be assumed to be mathemat- ically well behaved and using the translational invariance it follows on the other hand side that

4n1 Anoh(n1 -no) ~ - 02h(n) on2 for n > on.

(172) Altogether this demonstrates that

(n) ~ La?(n) for n > ồn

(173)

in agreement with Eq. (4) for the bond-bond correlation function P1(s) and with Eq. (7) for the chain velocity correlation function. Note that since h(n) does not depend on ôn, C(n) does not depend on ôn either in the limit n >> on.

The stochastic variables of interest in this review are described by a position Langevin equation of form [116]

gdx(n)~Sv(n) = f(n) = fr(n) + fc(n) (174)

dn

with { being the "friction constant" and ft(n) the total "force" acting on x(n) which may be decomposed in a random white force contribu- tion fr(n) and a colored force fc (n) stemming from the remaining (non- white) interactions of the degree of freedom under consideration with the bath and its constraints. Perfectly Fickian behavior would be ob- tained if only the white force contribution were present (fc(n) = 0).88 For x(n) being the position of a monomer or the CM of a chain as a function of time t, Eq. (174) corresponds to an overdamped motion as discussed in Sec. 6.2 for MC beads or in Sec. 6.3 for Rouse-like chains in the melt, Eq. (153). From Eq. (174) it follows for the displacement correlation function that

(n) = (v(n) . v(0) = 5-2 (f(n) - ft(0). (175)

The total force correlation function (ft(n) · ft(0)) at n > 0 decomposes now into four contributions:

(a) (fr(n) · fr(0)} = 0 since fr(n) is a white force,

(b) (fr(n) . fc(0)) = 0 since future white forces cannot be anticipated,

(c) (fc(n) . fc(0)) and

(d) (fc(n) . fr(0)} =- 2(fc(n) . fc(0)) due to the odd n-symmetry of the velocity v(n) = - v(-n) [205].89

88 While fr(n) and fc(n) are both of zero mean, one may add in addi- tion an external force fe which allows to determine the friction constant from the drift velocity: S (v(n) = fe. 89

Since v(n) = - v(-n) this implies ft(n) = - ft(-n) for the to- tal force which in turn yields (ft(n) . fc(0)) = - (ft(-n) . fc(0)). The identity (d) is then obtained by substituting (ft(n) . fc (0)} = (fc(n) . fc(0)) (due to (b)) and (ft(-n) . fc(0)) = (fc(n) . fr(0)) = (fc(n) . fr(0)) + (fc(n) . fc (0)) .

## B Static properties



## B.1 Moments and generating function



Higher moments of the segmental size distribution G(r,s) can be sys- tematically obtained from its Fourier transform G(q, s) = $ [G(r,s)] which is in this context sometimes called the "generating function" [116]. For ideal Gaussian chains the generating function is given by Go(q,s) = exp(-s(aq)2) where we have used a2 = b2 /2d to simplify the notation. Moments of the size distribution are given by proper derivatives of G(q,s) taken at q = 0. For example,

## (2)= (-1)PAG(q,s)|q=0



(177)

with 4 being the Laplace operator with respect to the wavevector q. A moment of order 2p is, hence, linked to only one coefficient A2p in the systematic expansion, G(q,s) = >p=0A2pq2P, of G(q,s) around q = 0. For our example this implies

(2)= (-1)(2p+1)! A2p (178)

in general and more specifically for a Gaussian distribution (r2P), = (2p+1)' sP a2P . The non-Gaussian parameters read, hence,

ap(s) = 1- (2p+1)! ([2)P 6Pp! (12P) =1-p! (179)

p A 2 A2p ,

which implies (by construction) &p = 0 for a Gaussian distribution. As various moments of the same global order 2p are linked to the same A2p they differ by a multiplicative constant independent of the details of the (isotropic) distribution G(q,s). For example, (2) = 6|A2|, (+) = 120A4, (x2)={2} = 2|A2}, {x2y2) = 8A4 with x and y denoting the spatial components of the segment vector r. Using Eq. (179) for p = 2 it follows that

Kxy(s) = 1- (x2 , 2) = 1 -2=02(s), (180)

(x2) (12 ) A2

i.e. the properties a2(s) and Kry(s) discussed in Figs. 29 and 30 must be identical in general provided that G(q,s) is isotropic and can be expanded in q2.

## B.2 Deviations of the segmental size distribution



We turn now to specific properties of G(q,s) computed for formally infinite polymer chains in the melt. In practice, these results are also relevant for small segments in large chains, N >> s » 1, and, espe- cially, for segments located far from the chain ends. These chains are nearly Gaussian and the generating function can be written as G(q, s) = Go(q,s)+ 8G(q,s) where according to Eq. (56) we have a small pertur- bation 8G(q,s) = - (UG),+(U), (G), due to the effective interaction potential ~(q) given by Eq. (66). In this paragraph we use bo = 6a3 for the bond length of the Gaussian reference chain of the perturbation

Fig. 48 Interaction diagrams used in reciprocal space for the calcula- tion of 8G(q,t) in the scale free limit. There exist three nonzero contri- butions to first-order perturbation, the first involving two points inside the segment (first two lines of Eq. (182)), the second one point inside and one outside the segment (third line of Eq. (182)) and the third one point on either side of the segment (last line of Eq. (182)).

(181)

As illustrated in Fig. 48, there are three contributions to this perturba- tion: one due to interactions between two monomers inside the segment (left panel), one due to interactions between an internal monomer and an external one (middle panel) and one due to interactions between two external monomers located on opposite sides (right panel). In analogy to the derivation of the form factor described in Ref. [83] this yields:

where we have set Q = (a0q) 2 +t. The graph given in the left panel of Fig. 48 corresponds to the first two lines, the middle panel to the third line and the right panel to the last one. Seeking for the mo- ments we expand 8G(q,t) around q = 0. Having in mind chain strands counting many monomers (s >> 1), we need only to retain the most singular terms for t -> 0. Defining the two dimensionless constants c= (3π3/2a;ρ)-1= 24/π3/bop and e = vξ/3πας = 12νξ /πb; this expansion can be written as

where we have used Euler's Gamma function I (x) [44]. The first lead- ing term at each order in q2 - being proportional to the coefficient e - ensures the renormalization of the effective bond length bo -> b. The next term scaling with the coefficient c corresponds to the leading fi- nite strand size correction. Performing the inverse Laplace transforma- tion I(a)/ta -> sa-1 and adding the Gaussian reference distribution Go(q,s) this yields the A2p-coefficients for the expansion of G(q,s)

where we have defined

(187)

for the effective bond length with Gz0 = vp/bop. We remind that bo refers here to the bond length of the Gaussian reference chain while b is the effective bond length for asymptotically long chains. Since our key interest is not as for Edwards to predict b [4,43] but to describe the deviations for finite s from the Gaussian limit for s -> N which sets the relevant reference length scale. Setting thus b0 = b this leads to Eq. (76) with b being a fit parameter. Using Eq. (179) one justifies similarly Eq. (78) for the Gaussianity parameter &p.

The moments Eq. (186) completely determine the segmental dis- tribution G(r,s) which is indicated in Eq. (73). While at least in prin- ciple this may be done directly by inverse Fourier-Laplace transforma- tion of the correction 8G(q,t) to the generating function it is helpful to simplify further Eq. (182). We observe first that 8℃(q,t) does diverge for strictly incompressible systems (v -> 0) and one must keep v finite in the effective potential whenever necessary to ensure convergence (actually everywhere but in the diagram corresponding to the interac- tion between two external monomers). Since we are not interested in the wave vectors larger than 1/§ we expand 8℃(q,t) for § -> 0 which leads to the much simpler expression

with Q = (aoq)2 +t. The first term diverges as vv for diverging v. It renormalizes the effective bond length in the zero order term which is indicated in the first line of Eq. (73). The next two terms scale both as vº. Subsequent terms must all vanish for diverging v and can be discarded. It is then easy to perform an inverse Fourier-Laplace trans- formation of the two relevant v0-terms. This yields

8G(x,s)= Go(x,s) - 3 7 ( 2 + 35 63)

(189)

with x=r/gov/s = v6n. This is consistent with the expression given in Eq. (73).

## B.3 Intramolecular form factor F (q)



The deviation 8F (q) = F(q) - Fo(q) of the intramolecular form factor from the Gaussian reference Fo(q) can be readily obtained from the deviation 8G(q,t) of the subchain size distribution in Fourier-Laplace space. Since G(q,s) = (exp(-iq ·r)) we have for asymptotically long chains

8F(q)=2|ds 8G(q,s)=28℃(q,t=0)

(190)

where we focus on the intermediate scale-free wavevector regime which does not depend on the chain length distribution pN. Using Eq. (188) derived in Appendix B.2 one obtains

8F(q) ~- 2- 4īt@6 νξ2 π/2 = 9 1

q 4 b3 p bq' 1 −

where only the third term of Eq. (188) contributes.90 Note that b = V6a stands now for both the measured effective bond length and the bond length of the Gaussian reference chain. It follows from Eq. (191) that within first-order perturbation theory

F(q)=Fo(q)+8F(q) ~ Fo(q) (1- 3 bq one may rewrite the interaction integral as

(192)

8 b3 p

which is equivalent to the prediction Eq. (14) made in the Introduction. Note that this perturbation result is consistent with the renormalization group calculations of semidilute solutions by Schäfer [7,71]. This is of course expected since semidilute solutions may be considered as incompressible melts of (semidilute) blobs [3].

## B.4 Angular correlations P1 (s)



We present here the direct perturbation calculation of the bond-bond correlation function P1 (s) of Flory-distributed linear chains in recipro- cal space following the discussion in Sec. 2.4.6. As sketched in panel (b) of Fig. 5, one only needs to compute the interaction diagram be- tween the monomers of the two dangling tails if the two bonds Z1 and 42 are placed outside the subchain of length s connecting the head of the first bond 41 with the tail of the second bond 42. To simplify the notations we set immediately bo = b and do = a and do not distinguish between the bond l of the computer model connecting the monomers and the effective Gaussian bond length b, i.e. we set Co. = (b/l)2 = 1. Restating Eq. (80) the relevant interaction diagram Io (s) reads91

dq ·Go(q,s)/ (q,q)v(q)w(q). (193)

PI(s) = Io(s) = (-1) /- (27)d

The negative sign in front of the integral is due to the negative sign of the general perturbation calculation formula Eq. (57). The first factor Go(q,s) = exp(-(aq)2s) in the integral over the wavevector q stands for the Fourier transformed Gaussian propagator Go(r,s) between the two bonds indicated in Fig. 5(b). Using Eq. (82) the scalar product of the bond vectors in real space is represented by the scalar product of the wavevectors flowing through the bonds. Note that the momentum flows in the same direction as the two bonds and the operator thus reads ≤(q,q) =- (bq/d)2. We assume that chains are Flory-distributed and

90 The first term in Eq. (188) must be discarded as before since it only renormalizes the effective bond length and would also contribute to the reference form factor F0(q).

91 The diagram Io(q) = (-1)Go(q,s)≤ (q,q)~(q)w(q) in reciprocal space is very similar to the diagram (l) indicated in Fig. 49 for the cal- culation of the bond-bond correlation function PI(r) as a function of distance r. Since for PI (s) we want to sample at constant s between the bond pairs irrespective of the distance between the bonds no momen- tum needs to be injected in the diagram and the momentum flowing along the diagram is constant everywhere.

that the effective interaction ~(q) between two monomers in the two dangling ends is described by Eq. (65). The combinatorics between the interacting monomers - corresponding to the second line in Eq. (79) - leads using Eq. (29) to an additional weight factor

w(q) : ((aq)2 + u)2 1

(194)

for the two Flory-distributed dangling tails. The task is thus to compute PI(s) = d

1 gp ((aq)2+u)((aq)2 +2/g) 1 (195)

(2 ) d dq -(aq)2's bq 2

where we have used that §2 = a2 g/2 = a2 /2vp, Eq. (44). Rewriting the last factor in Eq. (195) as

1 (aq)2 +2/g) 1 −

× × (196) 2 1-ug/2 1

and defining the integral

A(x) = 1 v2 +x exp(-12) ,2 dy (27)d (197)

1

Pı(s) = 1 dpad sd/2 1 - ug/2 1 [A(x=us)-A(x=2s/g)] (198)

We remind that the integral A(x) takes the asymptotics

lim A(x) = x-+0 (4Tt)d/2 1 and lim A(x) ~ lim 1/x = 0. x->00

(199)

Considering thus the limit of infinite Flory-distributed polymers (x = us -> 0) and incompressible solutions (x = 2s/g -> 0), Eq. (198) re- duces to

-0]= 1 bdp s@ 1

20 ) bap 50 (200)

with @ = d/2 in agreement with Eq. (11). Evaluating the integral A(x) over the wavevector in d = 3 dimensions one obtains for general x A(x) = 1

8T 3/2 (1-2x +21/7x3/2e erfc(Vx)) (201)

with erfc(x) being the complementary error function [44]. Setting cp = 24/ T3 /8(b3 p) in agreement with the power-law amplitude indicated in Eq. (9) and using u = s/g for the reduced subchain length it follows from Eq. (198) that

P1(s) = CP g3/2 1 - u g/2 1 4 :(1-ug/2) √ u

- 4v2Te2"erfc(v2u) +2(ug)3/2/Tells erfc(Vus) . (202)

Since implicit to the effective interaction potential Eq. (65) we have ug/2 << 1 and since we focus on short subchains with us = s/ (N) << 1, this further simplifies to

Pı(s) = Cp 93/2

√ 4 -4/2te2"erfc(\2u) +2/Tt(Mg)3/2 . (203)

For large chains, u -> 0, the last term in the bracket decays rapidly as 1/ (N)3/2 and can be omitted for reasonable (mean) chain lengths. This leads to Eq. (83) which we have checked numerically in Fig. 26 for monodisperse chains. The first term in the bracket dominates only for small u when the structure within a (very) large thermal blob is probed. The bracket reduces to 4/ Vū-(4//@-1/u3/2+ ... )~1/u3/2 in the opposite large-u limit as may be seen by expanding the error function [44]. Eq. (203) thus reduces to Eq. (200) for d = 3. This thus confirms the key relation Eq. (9) for the power-law decay of the bond- bond correlation function for all g on scales larger than the thermal blob (s/g>1).

The last diagram (*) describes the finite-size corrections for P1(r) relevant for large distances r » r *.

## B.5 Distance dependence of angular correlations



## B.5.1 Interaction diagrams



We focus now on the low-wavevector regime where the melt can be considered as incompressible (at least in terms of thermal blobs) and assume a Flory-distributed bath of a given inverse mean chain length u. The corresponding results for infinite chains may be obtained by setting u = 0. The bond-bond correlation function PI (r) = (41 - 42} /12 is obtained by averaging over all intrachain pairs of bonds 41 and Z2 at a given distance r = |r| irrespective of their curvilinear distance s. Setting thus t = 0 for the Laplace variable conjugated to s, the summed up Fourier-Laplace propagator becomes according to Eq. (29)

Ğ(k) = Go(k,t)|=0 = (ak)2 + u 1

.

(204)

Using Eq. (60) and Eq. (63) the effective interaction potential thus reads [87]

Ğ(k) =

1 2p

~(k)Ğ(k)= Fo(k)p

(205)

on large scales k << 1/o and k << 1/§. The momentum q inserted in the interaction diagrams shown in Fig. 49 is conjugated to the distance r between both bonds. Momentum is a conserved quantity flowing from one correlated point to the other. The wavevector associated with the first bond at the origin is called q , the wavevector through the second bond q,. As may be better seen from the sketch included in Fig. 27, the first bond is now within the s-subchain while the second bond is chosen to be outside. Putting both bonds within the subchain leads to trivial correlations even for Gaussian chains, putting both bonds out- side the subchain leads to a vanishing correlation for § -> 0 as already remarked in Footnote 38 for the correlation function C1(r) [89]. The first two diagrams in Fig. 49 for closed rings (r) and linear chains (I) are given by the convolution integrals

We remind that for closed cycles the bond-bond correlation function does not vanish even for perfect Gaussian statistics and it is the corre- sponding zero order average (A) = (1), which is computed by the first integral. The minus sign in front of the second integral for linear

chains stems from the minus sign implied by the first order perturba- tion, Eq. (57). Using Eq. (82) and assuming Eq. (205) the integrals simplify considerably

with G(r) being the probability distribution to find another monomer of the chain around a reference monomer as given by Eq. (30). Inter- estingly, up to a constant prefactor the integrals Ir and I are thus equal on large scales (r » §).

## B.5.2 Normalization and bond-bond correlations



Focusing from now on the 3D case the bond-bond correlation function of closed rings Pr(r) is obtained from Ir(r) after normalization with Ğ(r). Using Eq. (30) this yields

Pr(r) = -(2) - (1+2x)2 (212) b 31 with x = Ur/2a comparing the distance r to the typical (z-averaged) size Rg,z ~ av (N) of Flory-distributed chains. The reason for the nor- malization factor G2 (r) is that for Pr(r) both bonds are known to be bonds of the same polymer ring while the interaction integral Eq. (206) corresponds only to a probability G(r) for both bonds being in the same chain times a probability G(r) that this chain is closed. That Pr(r) is negative is of course due to the closure constraint which corresponds to an entropic spring force bending the second bond back to the origin. For large chain lengths the factor (1 +2x)2 can be neglected and the bond-bond correlation function Pr(r) becomes a scale-free power law.

2

For linear chains it follows immediately from Eq. (211) that

h(r) =Poo(r)h(x) with Poo(r) = 1 1 12π pr3 (213)

Pı(r) = G(r)

being the limit for asymptotically long chains and using the scaling function h(x) = (1 +2x)2 exp(-2x) for the finite-u corrections. The normalization factor G(r) is due to the fact that for P1(r) both bonds are known to belong to the same chain while the interaction integral Eq. (207) corresponds only to a probability G(r) for both bonds to be on the same chain. As compared to the closed cycles the correla- tion has the opposite sign since the attractive spring of the ring closure indicated by G(q ) in Eq. (208) has been replaced by the effective re- pulsion indicated by -Ğ(q1)v(q1)Ğ(g1) = - Ğ(q1)/2p in Eq. (209). This repulsion bends the second bond away from the origin increasing thus the bond-bond correlation function.

## B.5.3 Sum rule and geometrical interpretation



Interestingly, the perturbation result, Eq. (210), for Flory-distributed chains may be rewritten as

P1(r)+-

G(r)P.(r) =0 2p

(214)

57

where we have used the normalization factors mentioned above. This "sum rule" suggests a geometrical interpretation of the observed re- lation between infinite linear chains and closed cycles which may re- main valid beyond the one-loop approximation used here.92 The idea is that in an hypothetical ideal melt containing both linear chains and closed cycles all correlations disappear (on distances much smaller than the typical chain sizes) when summed up over the contributions of both architectures. The weight (G(r)/2)/p corresponds to the frac- tion of bond pairs in closed loops.93 Since the orientational corre- lations in ideal cycles are necessarily long-ranged due the ring clo- sure (Eq. 212), it follows, assuming the sum rule, that the same ap- plies to bond pairs of linear chains. Since bonds in closed cycles are anti-correlated (Pr(r) < 0), they must be aligned (P1(r) > 0) for linear chains. Interestingly, if one turns the argument around assuming the sum rule (rather than deriving it as we did) this imposes Eq. (205) and, hence, the effective intrachain potential v(k) = ((ak)2 + u)/2p for a Flory-distributed linear chain bath.

## B.5.4 Finite chain size effects for Flory-distributed chains



We emphasize that the diagram (l) shown in Fig. 49 is not sufficient to characterize P1 (r) for larger distances since the last diagram (*) corre- sponding to the convolution integral

1,(g)=(-1) / dk (21)}G(q)(9,-k)Ğ(q-k)v(k)Ğ(k) (215)

provides, as we shall see, the actual cutoff of the power law in this limit. Using again Eq. (82) and Eq. (205) the integral factorizes

I(g) = 20 / 127]“(k) × Ğ(q), 9 (216) = - c+ X (aq)2Ğ(q)

in which we dump local physics at large wavevector k. Before eval- uating the angular correlations in real space it is important to clarify the physics described by the diagram. The underlined second factor in Eq. (216) characterizes the alignment of the bond vectors of the monomers n1 and n2 - 1 at a fixed distance r of the monomers n1 and n2 = n1 +s as shown by the sketch included in Fig. 27. Obviously, even for Gaussian chains these two bonds become more and more aligned if the distance r = |z| gets larger than bs1/2, i.e. when the chain segment becomes stretched. For perfectly Gaussian chains the bonds L1 and 2 at n1 and n2 would still remain uncorrelated, however, since the second

92 A similar sum rule is obtained for the bond-bond correlation function P1(s) as a function of arc-length s. One verifies readily that A(s) = - I.(s)/2p and thus

P1(s)+: 2p G(s)P.(s)=0

with Pr(s) ~ - 1/s and G(s) ~ s1-dv being the density of chains of length N > s in a Flory-distributed bath which would return after N steps to the origin. This is the most elegant way to demonstrate that P1(s) ~ 1/sdv.

93 Note that G(r) is the density of the monomers of both strands the reference monomer is connected to. We know for linear chains as for cycles that both bonds are connected by a first strand. The probability for both bonds to be in a closed loop is given by the density G(r)/2 of the second strand. The factor 1/2 is thus needed to avoid counting the same ring twice.

bond is outside the chain segment on which we have imposed the dis- tance constraint. As indicated by the dashed line in the diagram, it is then due to the effective interaction between the monomers within the stretched segment (n < n2) and the monomers outside (n > n2) that the bonds at n2 - 1 and n2 get aligned and then in turn the two bonds at n1 and n2. We note that, strictly speaking, c+ depends on the mean chain length (N), since G(k) is a function of u. However, one checks readily that this effect can be neglected for reasonable mean chain lengths. We also note that the constant c. is finite, since the UV divergence which formally arises for large k (where c+ ~ k) may be regularized by local and, hence, model dependent physics.94 We determine c+ numerically from our simulations of self-assembled linear EP in Sec. 5.4.2.

Assuming a finite and chain length independent coefficient c+ in Eq. (217) and inserting the propagator Eq. (204) we obtain by inverse Fourier transformation

I+(r) = c+ (uĞ(r)- 8(r)) (219) for the interaction integral in real space. Normalizing I4(r) as before with G(r) and summing over both diagrams for linear chains this yields P1(r) = Poo(r)h(x)+c+ul (220) for r >> š > 0. Comparing both terms in Eq. (220) one verifies that a crossover occurs at r$ ~ b (N)1/3 in agreement with Eq. (124) stated in the main text. The bond-bond correlation function P1(r) of an incom- pressible solution of Flory distributed polymers becomes thus constant for r >> rx. This remarkable result is essentially due to the polydis- persity. This allows to find for all distances r pairs of bonds 41 and Z2 stemming from segments which are slightly stretched by an energy of order u « 1 and which are, hence, slightly shorter than a unstretched segment of length s ~ (r/b)2. Since there are more shorter chains and chain segments this just compensates the decay of the weight due to the weak stretching. Although the number of such slightly stretched segments decays strongly with distance, their relative effect with re- spect to the typical unstretched segments, eu - 1 ~ u, remains con- stant for all r. It is for this reason that the chemical potential appears in the second term of Eq. (220). Please note that bond pairs from strongly stretched segments (corresponding to an energy much larger than u) are, however, still exponentially suppressed and can be ne- glected. As explained in detail in Ref. [87], this is qualitatively differ- ent for monodisperse chains where strongly stretched chain segments contribute increasingly to the average for large distances.

## B.6 Non-extensivity of the chemical potential



We take again as a reference for the perturbation calculation a melt of Gaussian chains where the bond length b is set by the effective bond length of asymptotically long chains. Averages performed over this un- perturbed reference system are labeled by an index 0. The task is now to compute the ratio Q(n)/Qo(n) of the perturbed to the unperturbed partition function of the test chain of length n plugged into the bath of N-chains,

1 - Q(n) Q0(n) = 1 - (e-un>0 ~

n

(un)o = >(n-s) | dr Go(r,s)~(r) s=0

(221)

with the perturbation potential un being the sum of the effective mono- mer interactions v(r) of all pairs of monomers of the test chain. The

94 For soft melts with weak bare excluded volume v = 1 /gp, i.e. § » b, it can be shown that an upper cutoff wavevector k~ ~ 1/§ regularizes the integral over k. The coefficient becomes c = 1/2πpb2ξ. Using b = 3.244 and § = 0.5 for p = 0.5/8 this gives c+ ~ 0.48. This is not that far off the best fit value c+ ~ 0.14 considering that for small š ≤ b one expects c+ to be rather determined by the model-depending stiffness between adjacent bonds.

factor n - s in Eq. (221) counts the number of equivalent monomer pairs separated by an arc-length s. The deviation 8 un from Flory's hy- pothesis is then given by the contribution to (un), which is non-linear in n. The calculation of Eq. (221) in d dimensions is most readily per- formed in Fourier-Laplace space with q being the wavevector conju- gated to the monomer distance r and t the Laplace variable conjugated to the chain length n. The Laplace transformed averaged perturbation potential reads

1 ∞ U = |_dn(un)ge-" = dª q Go(q,t)v(q)w(t) (222)

(27C)a

where G0(q,t) represents the Fourier-Laplace transformed Gaussian propagator Go(r,s) as given in Eq. (28) and the weight factor w(t) = 6. J. des Cloizeaux, G. Jannink, Polymers in Solution : their Mod- elling and Structure (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1990) 1/t2 accounts again for the combinatorics between the interaction monomers 7. L.

The effective interaction potential v(q) being given by Eq. (59) one realizes that the naive perturbation calculation using Eq. (222) is formally diverging at high wavevectors in three dimensions (becoming only regular below d = 2). This is due to monomer self-interactions which must be first subtracted. Using Eq. (64) instead of Eq. (59) even makes things worse due to an additional divergency associated with the self-interactions of the blobs whose size was set to zero (g -> 0). However, since we are not interested in (possibly diverging) contribu- tions linear in the length of the test chain or independent of it, we can freely subtract linear terms (i.e., terms ~ 1/t2 in Laplace space) or con- stant terms (i.e., terms ~ 1/t) to regularize and to simplify ur. Such a transformation leads to

where " ... " stands for the linear and constant contributions we do not compute. This converges now for incompressible melts in d < 2 dimen- sions. Applying Eq. (223) to incompressible Flory-distributed melts, i.e. assuming Eq. (40), this yields

where we have read Eq. (224) as an inverse Fourier transform taken at r = 0. Remembering that a factor 1/t in t-space stands for an inte- gral " ds in n-space, the inverse Laplace transform of ut can be ex- pressed in terms of integrals of the return probability G(r = 0,s) = (4Tcsa2)-d/2. We obtain, hence, in n-space

where & Un stands for the non-extensive contribution to (un),. Note that the first term in the brackets scales as the correlation hole in d dimen- sion. Its marginal dimension is d = 2. The second term characterizes the effective two-body interaction of the test chain with itself. As one expects [3], its marginal dimension is d = 4. Although Eq. (226) is for- mally obtained for d < 2 it applies to higher dimensions by analytic continuation. In three dimensions Eq. (226) becomes

which demonstrates finally the non-extensive correction to the ideal polymer chain chemical potential announced in Eq. (108) and repre- sented by the solid lines in Fig. 18. The chemical potential for monodis- perse chains is obtained from Eq. (108) within the Padé approximation, Eq. (37), where u is replaced by 2/N. This result is indicated by the dash-dotted lines in Fig. 18. A more precise calculation for monodis- perse chains using the full Debye function is given in Ref. [88].
