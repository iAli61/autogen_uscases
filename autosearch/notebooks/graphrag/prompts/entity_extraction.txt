-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [chemical_structure, polymer, monomer, property, method, model, simulation, descriptor, interaction, dataset, algorithm, technique, tool, theory, representation, prediction, trend, confidence_interval, residual_plot, conductivity, interaction_parameter, potential, field_model, graph, hypergraph, node, edge, hyperedge, particle, force_field, energy_landscape, correlation_function, architecture, neural_network, fine_tuning, modality, Monte_Carlo, lattice, scission_energy, stereoregularity, tacticity, transition, functional_group, production_rule, generative_model, constraint, support_vector_machine, recurrent_neural_network, generative_adversarial_network, autoencoder, reinforcement_learning]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

## A. Monomer/Oligomer scale: The scales of chemical specifity



The basic building blocks are the monomers. They can have a simple chemical structure, as in the case of many commodity polymers such as polystyrene, or a rather complicated structure, as in the case of biopolymers such as RNA, DNA, or proteins. The structure of the monomers on the monomer scale determines local properties such as the charges and the polarization, the solubility in a solvent [101], the existence and structure of a hydra- tion shell [102], the local affinity to surfaces [103], or - in studies of polymer reactions, the monomer re- activity [104]. In general, these properties are also influenced by the larger scale structure of polymer systems. For example, the effective monomer re- activity depends on the accessibility of the reactive sites, which is determined not only by the local elec- tronic and steric monomer structure, but also by the polymer conformation [104, 105]. Likewise, the ef- fective charges and/or polarization of monomers de- pend on the local environment [106, 107]. In most cases, however, the corrections due to the larger scale structure

shaded bands. In all cases, there is a high level of agreement between predictions and experimental data points. Interestingly, the meta learner predicts averaged trends through the experimental data points. For example, in the case of copolymer (b), the predicted trend of Ta takes an averaged pathway through the scattered experimental data points across the range of the copolymer compositions. Also, the predicted trends display an appropriate level of smoothness, which indicates that the meta learner was regulated properly during training (we are using dropouts), thus avoiding both overfitting or underfitting. Another interesting finding is that the meta learner is capable of distilling key knowledge from the data set, as shown for Tm of polymer (b) in Figure 4: although no experimental data point is present at weight fraction 0, the meta learner predicts an upwards trend for Tm. This Tm trend is inferred from the Tg trend for the same polymer. Apparently, the data on which

, the values of metrics in this case are also lesser than the model using both descriptors. Hence we can conclude that calculated descriptors also add value to the model. From these tests, we find that the R2 shows a value of > 0.9 in both calculated and learnt descriptor case. Therefore, if one is not interested in using the learnt descriptors in order to keep the model more explainable, then also a R2 ~ 0.92 can be attained using the calculated descriptors alone. Further, we also verify the fact that both learnt and calculated descriptors provide useful information as removing either reduces the values of all metrics. The high R2 value of 0.9949 for the model using both descriptors validates the idea that the configurational fingerprint adds value to the predictive capabilities of the model.

The residual curve is also plotted (Figure 3) to see differences between the actual and predicted values. The residual plot shows the ideal behaviour of being uniformly distributed around zero. Additionally, the residual plot shows that there are no correlations and most of the values lie between +0.2. Anomalously high value at X~75000 occurs because the position vector takes very large values in this case. It is a singular exceptional case when the MC simulation ends up taking very
