Understanding and manipulating the structures of polymers is essential for tailoring their properties to specific applications in materials science.\n",

      "To represent polymers effectively, researchers have developed various methods and techniques that capture their structural complexity. The representation of polymers involves the translation of their chemical information into a format that can be easily understood and used for analysis and modeling. This representation is important for studying their behavior, predicting their properties, and designing new polymers with desired characteristics.\n",

      "The historical evolution of polymer representation has paved the way for the development of different representation methods. Chemical formulas were among the first representations used to describe the elemental composition of polymers. However, this method alone does not capture the spatial arrangement and connectivity of polymer chains, limiting its ability to fully represent complex structures.\n",
