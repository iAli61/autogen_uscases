That is, if the bond is convertible into a variable number of shares\\nwith a value equal to unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal\\namount outstanding. In this case, the bond would satisfy the SPPI criteria and\\nwould be derecognised on conversion. However, such conversion features\\nare often capped because, otherwise, the issuer could be required to deliver a\\npotentially unlimited amount of shares. The existence of such a cap, if genuine,\\nwould result in the failure of the SPPI test.\\n\\nBail-in procedures imposed by regulator\\n\\nQ33: Does the ability of a regulator to impose losses (referred to as\\n\\u2018write-down\\u2019) on the holder of a bond, or conversion into shares,\\nresult in non-SPPI cash flows?53\\n\\nFact pattern 1: the provision is not a contractual feature\\n\\nA regulated bank issues an instrument with a stated maturity date. The\\ninstrument pays a fixed interest rate and all contractual cash flows are\\nnon-discretionary.\\n\\nHowever, the issuer is subject to legislation that permits or requires a national\\nresolution authority to impose losses on holders of particular instruments,\\nincluding the above-mentioned instrument, in certain circumstances. For\\nexample, the national resolution authority has the power to write down the\\npar amount of such an instrument or to convert it into a fixed number of the\\nissuer\\u2019s ordinary shares if the national resolution authority determines that the\\nissuer is having severe financial difficulties, needs additional regulatory capital\\nor is failing.\\n\\nAnalysis 1\\n\\nThe holder would analyse the contractual terms of the financial instrument to\\ndetermine whether they give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of\\nprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and thus are\\nconsistent with a basic lending arrangement.\\n\\n52 Q&A based on IFRS 9.B4.1.14 Instrument F.\\n53 Q&A based on IFRS 9.B4.1.13 Instrument E\n",
      "\\n\\nContractually linked instruments\\n\\nThe effect of credit enhancement on the contractually linked instruments test\\n\\nQ42: What would be the effect on the look-through test for contractually\\nlinked instruments if the SPE benefits from credit enhancement\\nthrough the purchase of a credit default swap?\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nPurchased credit default swaps (CDSs) would generally be viewed as reducing\\nthe risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments, provided that, in\\ncombination with the underlying instruments, the cash flows are solely\\npayments of principal and interest. This would require that the derivative pays\\nout only to compensate for loss of principal and interest and not, for instance,\\nthe instruments\\u2019 fair value.\\n\\nThis may be difficult to achieve, as most CDS will repay the par amount, which\\nwill not equal the principal if the assets are acquired at a discount or a premium.\\n\\nAlso, in practice, many SPE structures contain written rather than purchased\\nCDSs, which will not be viewed as reducing the credit risk of the underlying\\npool. Also see the response to Q43.\\n\\nInvestments in collateralised debt obligations (CDOs)\\n\\nQ43: How would investments in CDOs be accounted for under IFRS 9?\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nIt is necessary to distinguish between cash CDOs (in which the SPE holds the\\nunderlying reference assets) and synthetic CDOs (in which the reference\\nexposure is achieved through a derivative). Investments in cash CDOs may\\nqualify for amortised cost or FVOCI measurement, as long as the underlying\\nassets also qualify for amortised cost or FVOCI accounting and the other\\nrequirements of IFRS 9 are met. But an investment in a synthetic CDO would\\nnot qualify, as the derivatives on the reference portfolio would not reduce the\\nvariability of the cash flows of the assets in the pool or align the cash flows in\\nthe manner permitted by IFRS 9 (see the response to Q42).\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 54\\n\\nA practical point to note is that it may be difficult for the holder to perform the\\nlook-through test if all the underlying reference assets of the CDO have not\\nbeen acquired at the time of the investment in the CDO. As a result, the holder\\nmay not be able to assess whether all the underlying reference assets of the\\nCDO would qualify for measurement at amortised cost or FVOCI. In such\\ncircumstances, we believe that the holder will need to consider amongst other\\nthings, the objectives of the CDO as well as the investment mandate of the\\nCDO\\u2019s manager before determining whether the investment qualifies for\\nmeasurement at amortised cost or FVOCI.\\n\\nSeizure of a CDO\\u2019s collateral and its effect on a tranche\\u2019s classification\\n\\nQ44: How would the seizure of collateral (in the circumstances described\\nbelow) affect the classification of an investment in a tranche of a CDO\\nthat would otherwise be eligible for measurement at amortised cost\\nor FVOCI?\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe underlying pool of instruments of a CDO may contain only assets eligible\\nfor measurement at amortised cost or FVOCI, but could then change to include\\nproperty or equity securities if collateral is seized following default by the\\nunderlying borrower of an asset in the CDO. The seizure of the collateral\\nmay result in derecognition of the original secured asset and recognition of\\nthe property/equity security as a new asset by the issuer of the CDO. The\\nproperty/equity security may then be sold at the discretion of the CDO\\u2019s\\ninvestment manager.\\n\\nNote that paragraph B4.1.26 of IFRS 9 explicitly states that if the underlying\\npool of instruments can change after initial recognition in such a way that the\\npool may not meet the contractually linked instruments test, then the tranche\\nshall be measured at FVTPL\n",

That is, if the bond is convertible into a variable number of shares\\\\nwith a value equal to unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal\\\\namount outstanding. In this case, the bond would satisfy the SPPI criteria and\\\\nwould be derecognised on conversion. However, such conversion features\\\\nare often capped because, otherwise, the issuer could be required to deliver a\\\\npotentially unlimited amount of shares. The existence of such a cap, if genuine,\\\\nwould result in the failure of the SPPI test.\\\\n\\\\nBail-in procedures imposed by regulator\\\\n\\\\nQ33: Does the ability of a regulator to impose losses (referred to as\\\\n\\\\u2018write-down\\\\u2019) on the holder of a bond, or conversion into shares,\\\\nresult in non-SPPI cash flows?53\\\\n\\\\nFact pattern 1: the provision is not a contractual feature\\\\n\\\\nA regulated bank issues an instrument with a stated maturity date. The\\\\ninstrument pays a fixed interest rate and all contractual cash flows are\\\\nnon-discretionary.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the issuer is subject to legislation that permits or requires a national\\\\nresolution authority to impose losses on holders of particular instruments,\\\\nincluding the above-mentioned instrument, in certain circumstances. For\\\\nexample, the national resolution authority has the power to write down the\\\\npar amount of such an instrument or to convert it into a fixed number of the\\\\nissuer\\\\u2019s ordinary shares if the national resolution authority determines that the\\\\nissuer is having severe financial difficulties, needs additional regulatory capital\\\\nor is failing.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis 1\\\\n\\\\nThe holder would analyse the contractual terms of the financial instrument to\\\\ndetermine whether they give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of\\\\nprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and thus are\\\\nconsistent with a basic lending arrangement.\\\\n\\\\n52 Q&A based on IFRS 9.B4.1.14 Instrument F.\\\\n53 Q&A based on IFRS 9.B4.1.13 Instrument E\\n\\\\n\\\\nContractually linked instruments\\\\n\\\\nThe effect of credit enhancement on the contractually linked instruments test\\\\n\\\\nQ42: What would be the effect on the look-through test for contractually\\\\nlinked instruments if the SPE benefits from credit enhancement\\\\nthrough the purchase of a credit default swap?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nPurchased credit default swaps (CDSs) would generally be viewed as reducing\\\\nthe risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments, provided that, in\\\\ncombination with the underlying instruments, the cash flows are solely\\\\npayments of principal and interest. This would require that the derivative pays\\\\nout only to compensate for loss of principal and interest and not, for instance,\\\\nthe instruments\\\\u2019 fair value.\\\\n\\\\nThis may be difficult to achieve, as most CDS will repay the par amount, which\\\\nwill not equal the principal if the assets are acquired at a discount or a premium.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, in practice, many SPE structures contain written rather than purchased\\\\nCDSs, which will not be viewed as reducing the credit risk of the underlying\\\\npool. Also see the response to Q43.\\\\n\\\\nInvestments in collateralised debt obligations (CDOs)\\\\n\\\\nQ43: How would investments in CDOs be accounted for under IFRS 9?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nIt is necessary to distinguish between cash CDOs (in which the SPE holds the\\\\nunderlying reference assets) and synthetic CDOs (in which the reference\\\\nexposure is achieved through a derivative). Investments in cash CDOs may\\\\nqualify for amortised cost or FVOCI measurement, as long as the underlying\\\\nassets also qualify for amortised cost or FVOCI accounting and the other\\\\nrequirements of IFRS 9 are met. But an investment in a synthetic CDO would\\\\nnot qualify, as the derivatives on the reference portfolio would not reduce the\\\\nvariability of the cash flows of the assets in the pool or align the cash flows in\\\\nthe manner permitted by IFRS 9 (see the response to Q42).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 54\\\\n\\\\nA practical point to note is that it may be difficult for the holder to perform the\\\\nlook-through test if all the underlying reference assets of the CDO have not\\\\nbeen acquired at the time of the investment in the CDO. As a result, the holder\\\\nmay not be able to assess whether all the underlying reference assets of the\\\\nCDO would qualify for measurement at amortised cost or FVOCI. In such\\\\ncircumstances, we believe that the holder will need to consider amongst other\\\\nthings, the objectives of the CDO as well as the investment mandate of the\\\\nCDO\\\\u2019s manager before determining whether the investment qualifies for\\\\nmeasurement at amortised cost or FVOCI.\\\\n\\\\nSeizure of a CDO\\\\u2019s collateral and its effect on a tranche\\\\u2019s classification\\\\n\\\\nQ44: How would the seizure of collateral (in the circumstances described\\\\nbelow) affect the classification of an investment in a tranche of a CDO\\\\nthat would otherwise be eligible for measurement at amortised cost\\\\nor FVOCI?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nThe underlying pool of instruments of a CDO may contain only assets eligible\\\\nfor measurement at amortised cost or FVOCI, but could then change to include\\\\nproperty or equity securities if collateral is seized following default by the\\\\nunderlying borrower of an asset in the CDO. The seizure of the collateral\\\\nmay result in derecognition of the original secured asset and recognition of\\\\nthe property/equity security as a new asset by the issuer of the CDO. The\\\\nproperty/equity security may then be sold at the discretion of the CDO\\\\u2019s\\\\ninvestment manager.\\\\n\\\\nNote that paragraph B4.1.26 of IFRS 9 explicitly states that if the underlying\\\\npool of instruments can change after initial recognition in such a way that the\\\\npool may not meet the contractually linked instruments test, then the tranche\\\\nshall be measured at FVTPL\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe following sections cover the individual aspects of the SPPI test, starting\\\\nwith the meaning of the terms principal and interest in sections 4.1 and 4.2, as\\\\nwell as the different types of modified contractual cash flows and their effect on\\\\nthe SPPI test in section 4.3. Contractually linked instruments are separately\\\\ncovered in section 4.4.\\\\n\\\\n4.1 The meaning of \\\\u2018principal\\\\u2019\\\\nPrincipal is not a defined term in IFRS 9. However, the standard states that, for\\\\nthe purposes of applying the SPPI test, the principal is \\\\u2018the fair value of the\\\\nasset at initial recognition\\\\u2019 and that it may change over the life of the financial\\\\nasset (e.g., if there are repayments of principal).\\\\n\\\\nThe IASB believes that this meaning reflects the economics of the financial asset\\\\nfrom the perspective of the current holder; this means that the entity would\\\\nassess the contractual cash flow characteristics by comparing the contractual\\\\ncash flows to the amount that it actually invested.8\\\\n\\\\nIllustration 4-1 \\\\u2014 The meaning of principal\\\\n\\\\nEntity A issued a bond with a contractually stated principal of CU1,000. The\\\\nbond was originally issued at CU990. Because interest rates have risen sharply\\\\nsince the bond was originally issued, Entity B, the current holder of the bond,\\\\nacquired it in the secondary market for CU975. From the perspective of entity\\\\nB, the principal amount is CU975.\\\\n\\\\nThe principal is, therefore, not necessarily the contractual par amount, nor\\\\n(when the holder has acquired the asset subsequent to its origination) is it\\\\nnecessarily the amount that was advanced to the debtor when the instrument\\\\nwas originally issued.\\\\n\\\\n4.2 The meaning of \\\\u2018interest\\\\u2019\\\\nIFRS 9 states that the most significant elements of interest within a basic\\\\nlending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money\\\\nand credit risk. In addition, interest may also include consideration for other\\\\nbasic lending risks (e.g., liquidity risk) and costs (e.g., administrative costs)\\\\nassociated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time. In\\\\naddition, interest may include a profit margin that is consistent with a basic\\\\nlending arrangement. In extreme economic circumstances, interest can be\\\\nnegative if, for example, the holder of a financial asset, in effect, pays a fee for\\\\nthe safekeeping of its money for a particular period of time and that fee exceeds\\\\n\\\\n8 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.182(a)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n11 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nthe consideration the holder receives for the time value of money, credit risk\\\\nand other basic lending risks and costs.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, contractual terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the\\\\ncontractual cash flows that is unrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as\\\\nexposure to changes in equity prices or commodity prices, do not give rise to\\\\ncontractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the\\\\nprincipal amount outstanding.\\\\n\\\\nAn originated or a purchased financial asset can be a basic lending arrangement\\\\nirrespective of whether it is a loan in its legal form.\\\\n\\\\nThe IASB noted in the Basis for Conclusions that the assessment of interest\\\\nfocuses on what the entity is being compensated for (i.e., whether the entity is\\\\nreceiving consideration for basic lending risks, costs and a profit margin or is\\\\nbeing compensated for something else), instead of how much the entity\\\\nreceives for a particular element.9\\\\n\\\\nTime value of money is the element of interest that provides consideration for\\\\nonly the passage of time. That is, the time value of money element does not\\\\nprovide consideration for other risks or costs associated with holding the\\\\nfinancial asset. To make this assessment, an entity considers relevant factors\\\\nsuch as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period\\\\nfor which the interest rate is set.\\\\n\\\\nThe IASB also notes that, as a general proposition, the market in which the\\\\ntransaction occurs is relevant to the assessment of the time value of money\\\\nelement. For example, in Europe, it is common to reference interest rates to\\\\nLIBOR and in the United States it is common to reference interest rates to the\\\\nprime rate\\n\\\\n\\\\nLoans intended to be sub-participated\\\\n\\\\nQ18: How should an entity account for originated loans, when some are\\\\nintended to be sold or sub-participated?\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nAn entity may originate loans so that it holds part of the portfolio to maturity,\\\\nbut sells a portion in the near term, or sub-participates a portion of the loans to\\\\nother banks. The question arises whether, for the purposes of the application of\\\\nIFRS 9, the entity has one business model or two.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nThe entity could consider the activities of lending to hold and lending to sell\\\\nor sub-participate as two separate business models, requiring different skills\\\\nand processes.\\\\n\\\\n45 Q&A based on IFRS 9.B4.1.4 Example 3.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 40\\\\n\\\\nWhilst the financial assets resulting from the former activity would typically\\\\nqualify for amortised cost measurement as they are held to collect contractual\\\\ncash flows, those from the latter activity would not and, as they are to be sold\\\\nor sub-participated in the near future, they would need to be measured at\\\\nFVTPL.\\\\n\\\\nIf a loan is assessed, in part, to be sold or sub-participated, this raises the\\\\nadditional issue of whether a single financial asset can be classified into two\\\\nseparate business models. As it is already common under IAS 39 for loans to be\\\\nclassified in part as held for trading and in part at amortised cost, it is likely that\\\\nthis practice will continue under IFRS 9.\\\\n\\\\nQ19: What happens if the sale or sub-participation referred to in Q18 fails?\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nIn some cases, an entity may fail to achieve the intended disposal, having\\\\npreviously classified a portion of a loan at FVTPL because of the intention to sell.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nThe standard requires classification to be determined in accordance with the\\\\nbusiness model applicable at the point of initial recognition of the asset.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, the fact that the entity fails to achieve an intended disposal\\\\ndoes not trigger a reclassification in accordance with the standard as the\\\\nthreshold for reclassification is a high hurdle. Therefore, loans or portions of\\\\nloans that the entity fails to dispose of would continue to be recorded at FVTPL\\\\nfollowing the arguments in Q18.\\\\n\\\\nFVTPL business models\\\\n\\\\nPortfolio managed on a fair value basis\\\\n\\\\nQ20: What are the business models that result in measurement at FVTPL?\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nAn entity manages a portfolio and measures its performance on a fair value\\\\nbasis and makes decisions based on the fair value of the financial assets. Such\\\\nan objective typically results in frequent sales and purchases of financial assets.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nA portfolio of financial assets that is managed and whose performance is\\\\nevaluated on a fair value basis, is neither held to collect contractual cash flows\\\\nnor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. In\\\\naddition, a portfolio of financial assets that meets the definition of held for\\\\ntrading is not held to collect contractual cash flows or held both to collect\\\\ncontractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. The entity is primarily\\\\nfocused on fair value information and uses that information to assess the\\\\nassets\\\\u2019 performance and to make decisions.\\\\n\\\\nEven though the entity will collect contractual cash flows while it holds financial\\\\nassets in the FVTPL category, this is only incidental and not integral to\\\\nachieving the business model\\\\u2019s objective. Consequently, such portfolios of\\\\nfinancial assets must be measured at FVTPL.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n41 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nThe SPPI test\\\\nInstruments without \\\\u2019modified\\\\u2019 cash flows\\\\n\\\\nBond with a capped interest rate\\\\n\\\\nQ21: Can an instrument with a capped interest rate meet the SPPI test?46\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nAn entity holds a bond with a stated maturity date that pays a variable market\\\\ninterest rate. That variable interest rate is capped\\n\\\\n\\\\nImpact of early adopting and not restating comparatives on the annual\\\\nfinancial statements\\\\n\\\\nQ57: An entity with a financial year ending on 31 December decides to\\\\nadopt IFRS 9 with a date of initial application of 1 October 2017. If the\\\\nentity elects not to restate comparative information, what is the\\\\neffect on its 2017 financial statements?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nThe business model assessment will need to be made for financial assets\\\\nrecorded on the entity\\\\u2019s balance sheet as at the date of initial application (i.e., 1\\\\nOctober 2017), based on facts and circumstances existing as at that date. After\\\\nthe assessment is made at the date of initial application, the entity is required to\\\\napply the classification under IFRS 9 retrospectively. The difference between\\\\n\\\\n62 See paragraphs IFRS 9 BC4.117.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n63 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nthe previous carrying amounts and the revised carrying amounts of those\\\\nassets will be recognised in opening retained earnings, as at the beginning of\\\\nthe annual reporting period (1 January 2017 in this example, assuming the\\\\nentity is preparing annual financial statements).63\\\\n\\\\nIf the entity does not restate comparative figures, the comparative figures for\\\\n2016 would remain as previously reported. Consequently, the previous\\\\nclassification categories under IAS 39 (held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, etc.)\\\\nwill need to be presented as the prior year numbers in the 2017 statement of\\\\nfinancial position.\\\\n\\\\nNote also that there would be no adjustment to the 2017 results for financial\\\\ninstruments derecognised during the first three quarters of the year. This could\\\\nbe confusing and may require explanation. This complexity can be avoided by\\\\napplying IFRS 9 at the beginning of the annual reporting period rather than an\\\\ninterim reporting period.\\\\n\\\\nLoans previously reclassified from held for trading under IAS 39\\\\n\\\\nQ58: How does IFRS 9 interact with the Reclassification Amendments of\\\\nOctober 2008?\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nAt the date of initial application of IFRS 9, a bank holds a portfolio of loans that\\\\nit intends to sell as soon as possible, but is currently unable to do so due to\\\\nilliquidity in the market. The bank had taken advantage of the October 2008\\\\namendments to IAS 39 and because it had the intention and ability to hold the\\\\nassets for the foreseeable future, it had reclassified this portfolio from held for\\\\ntrading to loans and receivables.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nAn entity applying IFRS 9 for the first time should apply the business model\\\\nassessment at the date of initial application. Given management's intention to\\\\nsell the assets as soon as possible, the presumption would be that the portfolio\\\\nshould be classified as at FVTPL. It does not matter that the bank may have to\\\\nhold the portfolio for the foreseeable future due to the market's illiquidity. The\\\\nstandard is clear that the entity's objective should be to hold the assets to\\\\ncollect the contractual cash flows if it is to qualify for amortised cost\\\\nclassification. Such a portfolio would not meet the FVOCI criteria either if the\\\\nintention is to sell all of the financial assets in the near term.\\\\n\\\\nLoans held within a business intended for disposal\\\\n\\\\nQ59: At the date of transition to IFRS 9, how should an entity assess the\\\\nbusiness model of a portfolio of loans that is part of a business that a\\\\nbank has decided to dispose of?\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nAn international bank has a variety of businesses (in the sense of\\\\nIFRS 3 Business Combinations), each of which is managed separately. Before\\\\nthe date of initial application of IFRS 9, the bank makes a strategic decision to\\\\ndispose of its auto finance business, which originates loans. The portfolio of\\\\n\\\\n63 See paragraph IFRS 9.7.2.15.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 64\\\\n\\\\nloans is held under a business model whose objective is to collect contractual\\\\ncash flows of the loans. The bank intends to dispose of the entire business,\\\\nincluding personnel, IT systems and buildings, and not merely a portfolio of\\\\nloans.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nThere is no right answer in respect of these facts and circumstances\\nHowever, a particular interest rate does not necessarily reflect\\\\nconsideration for only the time value of money merely because that rate is\\\\nconsidered \\\\u2018normal\\\\u2019 in a particular market. For example, if an interest rate is\\\\nreset every year, but the reference rate is always a 15-year rate, it would be\\\\ndifficult for an entity to conclude that such a rate provides consideration for\\\\nonly the passage of time, even if such pricing is commonly used in that\\\\nparticular market. Accordingly, the IASB believes that an entity must apply\\\\njudgement to conclude whether the stated time value of money element meets\\\\nthe objective of providing consideration for only the passage of time.10\\\\n\\\\nHow we see it\\\\nIt could be argued that the standard is not entirely clear as to the status of\\\\nbenchmark rates such as LIBOR. For such rates, the consideration for credit\\\\nrisk is neither fixed, nor varies over time to reflect the specific credit risk of\\\\nthe obligor, but instead varies to reflect the credit risks associated with a\\\\nclass of borrowers. Given that LIBOR is cited in the standard as an example\\\\nof a rate that would satisfy the SPPI criteria, it would seem that this is not\\\\nan issue.\\\\n\\\\n9 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.182(b).\\\\n10 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.178.\\\\n\\\\nThe IASB acknowledges\\\\nthat different entities may\\\\nprice elements of interest\\\\ndifferently.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 12\\\\n\\\\n4.3 Modified contractual cash flows11\\\\n\\\\nSometimes, contractual provisions modify the cash flows of an instrument\\\\nsuch that they do not give rise to only a straightforward repayment of principal\\\\nand interest.\\\\n\\\\n4.3.1 De minimis and non-genuine features12\\\\n\\\\nA contractual cash flow characteristic does not affect the classification of the\\\\nfinancial asset if it can have only a de minimis effect on the contractual cash\\\\nflows of the financial asset. To make this determination, an entity must consider\\\\nthe possible effect of the contractual cash flow characteristic in each reporting\\\\nperiod and cumulatively over the life of the financial instrument.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, if a contractual cash flow characteristic could have an effect on the\\\\ncontractual cash flows that is more than de minimis (either in a single reporting\\\\nperiod or cumulatively) but that cash flow characteristic is not genuine, it does\\\\nnot affect the classification of a financial asset. A cash flow characteristic is\\\\nnot genuine if it affects the instrument\\\\u2019s contractual cash flows only on the\\\\noccurrence of an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely\\\\nto occur.\\\\n\\\\nHow we see it\\\\nAlthough the de minimis and non-genuine thresholds are high hurdles,\\\\nallowing entities to disregard such features will result in more debt\\\\ninstruments qualifying for the amortised cost or FVOCI measurement\\\\ncategories than in previous versions of IFRS 9. The terms will need to be\\\\ninterpreted by preparers in analysing the impact of the clarified SPPI test on\\\\nthe debt instruments they hold.\\\\n\\\\n4.3.2 Modified consideration for the time value of money13\\\\n\\\\nThere are contractual features that modify the time value of money element of\\\\ninterest (e.g., the tenor of the interest rate does not correspond with the\\\\nfrequency with which it resets). The standard describes such time value of\\\\nmoney elements as \\\\u2018imperfect\\\\u2019.14 In such cases, an entity must assess the\\\\nmodification to determine whether the contractual cash flows represent solely\\\\npayments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. In some\\\\ncircumstances, the entity may be able to make that determination by\\\\nperforming a qualitative assessment whereas, in other circumstances, it may be\\\\nnecessary to perform a quantitative analysis.\\\\n\\\\nThe objective of a quantitative assessment is to determine how different the\\\\ncontractual (undiscounted) cash flows could be from the (undiscounted) cash\\\\nflows that would arise if the time value of money element were not modified\\\\n(referred to as the \\\\u2018the benchmark\\\\u2019 cash flows)\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nGiven that investors enter and exit the fund based on fair value, the cash flows\\\\nof an investment in such a fund are not likely to be solely payments of principal\\\\nand interest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 52\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, such investments would not normally qualify for the FVOCI option\\\\nfor equity instruments as they do not normally meet the definition of an equity\\\\ninstrument from the perspective of the fund (i.e., the issuer). See Q48-Q50\\\\nregarding equity investments that can or cannot be classified at fair value\\\\nthrough OCI.\\\\n\\\\nSubordination features, non-recourse and full-recourse loans\\\\n\\\\nConventional subordination features\\\\n\\\\nQ39: Would a conventional subordination feature preclude a financial asset\\\\nfrom passing the SPPI test?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nIn almost every lending transaction, the creditor\\\\u2019s instrument is ranked relative\\\\nto the debtor\\\\u2019s other creditors\\\\u2019 instruments. An instrument that is subordinated\\\\nto other instruments may be considered to have contractual cash flows that are\\\\npayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding if the\\\\ndebtor\\\\u2019s non-payment arises only on a breach of contract and the holder has a\\\\ncontractual right to unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal\\\\namount outstanding even in the event of the debtor\\\\u2019s bankruptcy.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, a trade receivable that ranks its creditor as a general creditor\\\\nwould qualify as having payments of principal and interest on the principal\\\\namount outstanding. This is the case even if the debtor issued loans that are\\\\ncollateralised which, in the event of bankruptcy, would give that loan holder\\\\npriority over the claims of the general creditor in respect of the collateral, but\\\\ndoes not affect the contractual right of the general creditor to unpaid principal\\\\nand other amounts due.\\\\n\\\\nNon-recourse loans\\\\n\\\\nQ40: Would project finance loans pass the SPPI test?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nThe lender should apply the non-recourse provisions of IFRS 9 and \\\\u2018look-through\\\\u2019\\\\nto the underlying assets or cash flows.\\\\n\\\\nWhere a loan is given for the construction and maintenance of a toll road and\\\\nthe payments of cash flows to the lender are reduced or cancelled if less than\\\\na certain number of vehicles travel on that road, the loan will not pass the\\\\nSPPI test.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a loan with cash flows specifically referenced to the performance of\\\\nan underlying business will not pass the test.\\\\n\\\\nIn other cases, in which there is no such reference and there is adequate equity\\\\nin the project to absorb losses before affecting the ability to meet payments on\\\\nthe loan, it may well pass the SPPI test.\\\\n\\\\nQ41: Would a loan to an SPE that funds the acquisition of other assets pass\\\\nthe SPPI test?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nWhere a loan is provided to an SPE that funds the acquisition of other assets,\\\\nwhether that loan passes the SPPI test will depend on the specific\\\\ncircumstances of the arrangement.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n53 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nFor example, if the SPE uses the loan from the entity to fund investments in\\\\nassets which will not themselves pass the SPPI test, such as equity securities or\\\\nnon-financial assets, and the loan is the only source of finance to the SPE so\\\\nthat it absorbs any losses from the equity securities, it would probably not pass\\\\nthe cash flow characteristics test.\\\\n\\\\nWhether the loan is legally non-recourse or full-recourse does not matter in this\\\\nscenario because the SPE has limited other assets. If the loan was legally\\\\nfull-recourse and if the SPE would have sufficient equity to cover losses on its\\\\ninvestments, the loan may pass the SPPI test.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, if the assets were all debt instruments which would themselves pass\\\\nthe cash flow characteristics test, the loan to the SPE might well pass it too.\\\\n\\\\nIf the SPE was consolidated by the lender, the question becomes less relevant,\\\\nsince the loan to the SPE would be eliminated in the lender's consolidated\\\\nfinancial statements\\n\\n\",\n",

In this case, the bond would satisfy the SPPI criteria and\\nwould be derecognised on conversion.

This would require that the derivative pays\\nout only to compensate for loss of principal and interest and not, for instance,\\nthe instruments\\u2019 fair value.\\n\\nThis may be difficult to achieve, as most CDS will repay the par amount, which\\nwill not equal the principal if the assets are acquired at a discount or a premium.\\n\\nAlso, in practice, many SPE structures contain written rather than purchased\\nCDSs, which will not be viewed as reducing the credit risk of the underlying\\npool. Also see the response to Q43.\\n\\nInvestments in collateralised debt obligations (CDOs)\\n\\nQ43: How would investments in CDOs be accounted for under IFRS 9?\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nIt is necessary to distinguish between cash CDOs (in which the SPE holds the\\nunderlying reference assets) and synthetic CDOs (in which the reference\\nexposure is achieved through a derivative). Investments in cash CDOs may\\nqualify for amortised cost or FVOCI measurement, as long as the underlying\\nassets also qualify for amortised cost or FVOCI accounting and the other\\nrequirements of IFRS 9 are met. But an investment in a synthetic CDO would\\nnot qualify, as the derivatives on the reference portfolio would not reduce the\\nvariability of the cash flows of the assets in the pool or align the cash flows in\\nthe manner permitted by IFRS 9 (see the response to Q42).\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 54\\n\\nA practical point to note is that it may be difficult for the holder to perform the\\nlook-through test if all the underlying reference assets of the CDO have not\\nbeen acquired at the time of the investment in the CDO. As a result, the holder\\nmay not be able to assess whether all the underlying reference assets of the\\nCDO would qualify for measurement at amortised cost or FVOCI. In such\\ncircumstances, we believe that the holder will need to consider amongst other\\nthings, the objectives of the CDO as well as the investment mandate of the\\nCDO\\u2019s manager before determining whether the investment qualifies for\\nmeasurement at amortised cost or FVOCI.\\n\\nSeizure of a CDO\\u2019s collateral and its effect on a tranche\\u2019s classification\\n\\nQ44: How would the seizure of collateral (in the circumstances described\\nbelow) affect the classification of an investment in a tranche of a CDO\\nthat would otherwise be eligible for measurement at amortised cost\\nor FVOCI?\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe underlying pool of instruments of a CDO may contain only assets eligible\\nfor measurement at amortised cost or FVOCI, but could then change to include\\nproperty or equity securities if collateral is seized following default by the\\nunderlying borrower of an asset in the CDO. The seizure of the collateral\\nmay result in derecognition of the original secured asset and recognition of\\nthe property/equity security as a new asset by the issuer of the CDO. The\\nproperty/equity security may then be sold at the discretion of the CDO\\u2019s\\ninvestment manager.\\n\\nNote that paragraph B4.1.26 of IFRS 9 explicitly states that if the underlying\\npool of instruments can change after initial recognition in such a way that the\\npool may not meet the contractually linked instruments test, then the tranche\\nshall be measured at FVTPL\n",

      "Context is: \\n\\nThe following sections cover the individual aspects of the SPPI test, starting\\nwith the meaning of the terms principal and interest in sections 4.1 and 4.2, as\\nwell as the different types of modified contractual cash flows and their effect on\\nthe SPPI test in section 4.3. Contractually linked instruments are separately\\ncovered in section 4.4.\\n\\n4.1 The meaning of \\u2018principal\\u2019\\nPrincipal is not a defined term in IFRS 9. However, the standard states that, for\\nthe purposes of applying the SPPI test, the principal is \\u2018the fair value of the\\nasset at initial recognition\\u2019 and that it may change over the life of the financial\\nasset (e.g., if there are repayments of principal).\\n\\nThe IASB believes that this meaning reflects the economics of the financial asset\\nfrom the perspective of the current holder; this means that the entity would\\nassess the contractual cash flow characteristics by comparing the contractual\\ncash flows to the amount that it actually invested.8\\n\\nIllustration 4-1 \\u2014 The meaning of principal\\n\\nEntity A issued a bond with a contractually stated principal of CU1,000. The\\nbond was originally issued at CU990. Because interest rates have risen sharply\\nsince the bond was originally issued, Entity B, the current holder of the bond,\\nacquired it in the secondary market for CU975. From the perspective of entity\\nB, the principal amount is CU975.\\n\\nThe principal is, therefore, not necessarily the contractual par amount, nor\\n(when the holder has acquired the asset subsequent to its origination) is it\\nnecessarily the amount that was advanced to the debtor when the instrument\\nwas originally issued.\\n\\n4.2 The meaning of \\u2018interest\\u2019\\nIFRS 9 states that the most significant elements of interest within a basic\\nlending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money\\nand credit risk. In addition, interest may also include consideration for other\\nbasic lending risks (e.g., liquidity risk) and costs (e.g., administrative costs)\\nassociated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time. In\\naddition, interest may include a profit margin that is consistent with a basic\\nlending arrangement. In extreme economic circumstances, interest can be\\nnegative if, for example, the holder of a financial asset, in effect, pays a fee for\\nthe safekeeping of its money for a particular period of time and that fee exceeds\\n\\n8 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.182(a)\\n\\n\\n\\n11 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\n\\nthe consideration the holder receives for the time value of money, credit risk\\nand other basic lending risks and costs.\\n\\nHowever, contractual terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the\\ncontractual cash flows that is unrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as\\nexposure to changes in equity prices or commodity prices, do not give rise to\\ncontractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the\\nprincipal amount outstanding.\\n\\nAn originated or a purchased financial asset can be a basic lending arrangement\\nirrespective of whether it is a loan in its legal form.\\n\\nThe IASB noted in the Basis for Conclusions that the assessment of interest\\nfocuses on what the entity is being compensated for (i.e., whether the entity is\\nreceiving consideration for basic lending risks, costs and a profit margin or is\\nbeing compensated for something else), instead of how much the entity\\nreceives for a particular element.9\\n\\nTime value of money is the element of interest that provides consideration for\\nonly the passage of time. That is, the time value of money element does not\\nprovide consideration for other risks or costs associated with holding the\\nfinancial asset. To make this assessment, an entity considers relevant factors\\nsuch as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period\\nfor which the interest rate is set.\\n\\nThe IASB also notes that, as a general proposition, the market in which the\\ntransaction occurs is relevant to the assessment of the time value of money\\nelement. For example, in Europe, it is common to reference interest rates to\\nLIBOR and in the United States it is common to reference interest rates to the\\nprime rate\n",
      "\\n\\nLoans intended to be sub-participated\\n\\nQ18: How should an entity account for originated loans, when some are\\nintended to be sold or sub-participated?\\n\\nAdditional information\\n\\nAn entity may originate loans so that it holds part of the portfolio to maturity,\\nbut sells a portion in the near term, or sub-participates a portion of the loans to\\nother banks. The question arises whether, for the purposes of the application of\\nIFRS 9, the entity has one business model or two.\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe entity could consider the activities of lending to hold and lending to sell\\nor sub-participate as two separate business models, requiring different skills\\nand processes.\\n\\n45 Q&A based on IFRS 9.B4.1.4 Example 3.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 40\\n\\nWhilst the financial assets resulting from the former activity would typically\\nqualify for amortised cost measurement as they are held to collect contractual\\ncash flows, those from the latter activity would not and, as they are to be sold\\nor sub-participated in the near future, they would need to be measured at\\nFVTPL.\\n\\nIf a loan is assessed, in part, to be sold or sub-participated, this raises the\\nadditional issue of whether a single financial asset can be classified into two\\nseparate business models. As it is already common under IAS 39 for loans to be\\nclassified in part as held for trading and in part at amortised cost, it is likely that\\nthis practice will continue under IFRS 9.\\n\\nQ19: What happens if the sale or sub-participation referred to in Q18 fails?\\n\\nAdditional information\\n\\nIn some cases, an entity may fail to achieve the intended disposal, having\\npreviously classified a portion of a loan at FVTPL because of the intention to sell.\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe standard requires classification to be determined in accordance with the\\nbusiness model applicable at the point of initial recognition of the asset.\\n\\nIn this example, the fact that the entity fails to achieve an intended disposal\\ndoes not trigger a reclassification in accordance with the standard as the\\nthreshold for reclassification is a high hurdle.

In\\naddition, a portfolio of financial assets that meets the definition of held for\\ntrading is not held to collect contractual cash flows or held both to collect\\ncontractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. The entity is primarily\\nfocused on fair value information and uses that information to assess the\\nassets\\u2019 performance and to make decisions.\\n\\nEven though the entity will collect contractual cash flows while it holds financial\\nassets in the FVTPL category, this is only incidental and not integral to\\nachieving the business model\\u2019s objective.

Given management's intention to\\nsell the assets as soon as possible, the presumption would be that the portfolio\\nshould be classified as at FVTPL.

The\\nstandard is clear that the entity's objective should be to hold the assets to\\ncollect the contractual cash flows if it is to qualify for amortised cost\\nclassification.

      "However, a particular interest rate does not necessarily reflect\\nconsideration for only the time value of money merely because that rate is\\nconsidered \\u2018normal\\u2019 in a particular market. For example, if an interest rate is\\nreset every year, but the reference rate is always a 15-year rate, it would be\\ndifficult for an entity to conclude that such a rate provides consideration for\\nonly the passage of time, even if such pricing is commonly used in that\\nparticular market. Accordingly, the IASB believes that an entity must apply\\njudgement to conclude whether the stated time value of money element meets\\nthe objective of providing consideration for only the passage of time.10\\n\\nHow we see it\\nIt could be argued that the standard is not entirely clear as to the status of\\nbenchmark rates such as LIBOR. For such rates, the consideration for credit\\nrisk is neither fixed, nor varies over time to reflect the specific credit risk of\\nthe obligor, but instead varies to reflect the credit risks associated with a\\nclass of borrowers.

A cash flow characteristic is\\nnot genuine if it affects the instrument\\u2019s contractual cash flows only on the\\noccurrence of an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely\\nto occur.\\n\\nHow we see it\\nAlthough the de minimis and non-genuine thresholds are high hurdles,\\nallowing entities to disregard such features will result in more debt\\ninstruments qualifying for the amortised cost or FVOCI measurement\\ncategories than in previous versions of IFRS 9. The terms will need to be\\ninterpreted by preparers in analysing the impact of the clarified SPPI test on\\nthe debt instruments they hold.\\n\\n4.3.2 Modified consideration for the time value of money13\\n\\nThere are contractual features that modify the time value of money element of\\ninterest (e.g., the tenor of the interest rate does not correspond with the\\nfrequency with which it resets). The standard describes such time value of\\nmoney elements as \\u2018imperfect\\u2019.14 In such cases, an entity must assess the\\nmodification to determine whether the contractual cash flows represent solely\\npayments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. In some\\ncircumstances, the entity may be able to make that determination by\\nperforming a qualitative assessment whereas, in other circumstances, it may be\\nnecessary to perform a quantitative analysis.\\n\\nThe objective of a quantitative assessment is to determine how different the\\ncontractual (undiscounted) cash flows could be from the (undiscounted) cash\\nflows that would arise if the time value of money element were not modified\\n(referred to as the \\u2018the benchmark\\u2019 cash flows)\n",
