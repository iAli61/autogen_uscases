But an investment in a synthetic CDO would\\\\nnot qualify, as the derivatives on the reference portfolio would not reduce the\\\\nvariability of the cash flows of the assets in the pool or align the cash flows in\\\\nthe manner permitted by IFRS 9 (see the response to Q42).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 54\\\\n\\\\nA practical point to note is that it may be difficult for the holder to perform the\\\\nlook-through test if all the underlying reference assets of the CDO have not\\\\nbeen acquired at the time of the investment in the CDO. As a result, the holder\\\\nmay not be able to assess whether all the underlying reference assets of the\\\\nCDO would qualify for measurement at amortised cost or FVOCI. In such\\\\ncircumstances, we believe that the holder will need to consider amongst other\\\\nthings, the objectives of the CDO as well as the investment mandate of the\\\\nCDO\\\\u2019s manager before determining whether the investment qualifies for\\\\nmeasurement at amortised cost or FVOCI.\\\\n\\\\nSeizure of a CDO\\\\u2019s collateral and its effect on a tranche\\\\u2019s classification\\\\n\\\\nQ44: How would the seizure of collateral (in the circumstances described\\\\nbelow) affect the classification of an investment in a tranche of a CDO\\\\nthat would otherwise be eligible for measurement at amortised cost\\\\nor FVOCI?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nThe underlying pool of instruments of a CDO may contain only assets eligible\\\\nfor measurement at amortised cost or FVOCI, but could then change to include\\\\nproperty or equity securities if collateral is seized following default by the\\\\nunderlying borrower of an asset in the CDO. The seizure of the collateral\\\\nmay result in derecognition of the original secured asset and recognition of\\\\nthe property/equity security as a new asset by the issuer of the CDO.

Contractually linked instruments are separately\\\\ncovered in section 4.4.\\\\n\\\\n4.1 The meaning of \\\\u2018principal\\\\u2019\\\\nPrincipal is not a defined term in IFRS 9. However, the standard states that, for\\\\nthe purposes of applying the SPPI test, the principal is \\\\u2018the fair value of the\\\\nasset at initial recognition\\\\u2019 and that it may change over the life of the financial\\\\nasset (e.g., if there are repayments of principal).\\\\n\\\\nThe IASB believes that this meaning reflects the economics of the financial asset\\\\nfrom the perspective of the current holder; this means that the entity would\\\\nassess the contractual cash flow characteristics by comparing the contractual\\\\ncash flows to the amount that it actually invested.8\\\\n\\\\nIllustration 4-1 \\\\u2014 The meaning of principal\\\\n\\\\nEntity A issued a bond with a contractually stated principal of CU1,000. The\\\\nbond was originally issued at CU990.

In addition, interest may also include consideration for other\\\\nbasic lending risks (e.g., liquidity risk) and costs (e.g., administrative costs)\\\\nassociated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time. In\\\\naddition, interest may include a profit margin that is consistent with a basic\\\\nlending arrangement. In extreme economic circumstances, interest can be\\\\nnegative if, for example, the holder of a financial asset, in effect, pays a fee for\\\\nthe safekeeping of its money for a particular period of time and that fee exceeds\\\\n\\\\n8 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.182(a)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n11 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nthe consideration the holder receives for the time value of money, credit risk\\\\nand other basic lending risks and costs.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, contractual terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the\\\\ncontractual cash flows that is unrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as\\\\nexposure to changes in equity prices or commodity prices, do not give rise to\\\\ncontractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the\\\\nprincipal amount outstanding.\\\\n\\\\nAn originated or a purchased financial asset can be a basic lending arrangement\\\\nirrespective of whether it is a loan in its legal form.\\\\n\\\\nThe IASB noted in the Basis for Conclusions that the assessment of interest\\\\nfocuses on what the entity is being compensated for (i.e., whether the entity is\\\\nreceiving consideration for basic lending risks, costs and a profit margin or is\\\\nbeing compensated for something else), instead of how much the entity\\\\nreceives for a particular element.9\\\\n\\\\nTime value of money is the element of interest that provides consideration for\\\\nonly the passage of time. That is, the time value of money element does not\\\\nprovide consideration for other risks or costs associated with holding the\\\\nfinancial asset. To make this assessment, an entity considers relevant factors\\\\nsuch as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period\\\\nfor which the interest rate is set.\\\\n\\\\nThe IASB also notes that, as a general proposition, the market in which the\\\\ntransaction occurs is relevant to the assessment of the time value of money\\\\nelement.

Therefore, loans or portions of\\\\nloans that the entity fails to dispose of would continue to be recorded at FVTPL\\\\nfollowing the arguments in Q18.\\\\n\\\\nFVTPL business models\\\\n\\\\nPortfolio managed on a fair value basis\\\\n\\\\nQ20: What are the business models that result in measurement at FVTPL?\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nAn entity manages a portfolio and measures its performance on a fair value\\\\nbasis and makes decisions based on the fair value of the financial assets. Such\\\\nan objective typically results in frequent sales and purchases of financial assets.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nA portfolio of financial assets that is managed and whose performance is\\\\nevaluated on a fair value basis, is neither held to collect contractual cash flows\\\\nnor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. In\\\\naddition, a portfolio of financial assets that meets the definition of held for\\\\ntrading is not held to collect contractual cash flows or held both to collect\\\\ncontractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. The entity is primarily\\\\nfocused on fair value information and uses that information to assess the\\\\nassets\\\\u2019 performance and to make decisions.\\\\n\\\\nEven though the entity will collect contractual cash flows while it holds financial\\\\nassets in the FVTPL category, this is only incidental and not integral to\\\\nachieving the business model\\\\u2019s objective. Consequently, such portfolios of\\\\nfinancial assets must be measured at FVTPL.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n41 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nThe SPPI test\\\\nInstruments without \\\\u2019modified\\\\u2019 cash flows\\\\n\\\\nBond with a capped interest rate\\\\n\\\\nQ21: Can an instrument with a capped interest rate meet the SPPI test?46\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nAn entity holds a bond with a stated maturity date that pays a variable market\\\\ninterest rate.

Given management's intention to\\\\nsell the assets as soon as possible, the presumption would be that the portfolio\\\\nshould be classified as at FVTPL. It does not matter that the bank may have to\\\\nhold the portfolio for the foreseeable future due to the market's illiquidity. The\\\\nstandard is clear that the entity's objective should be to hold the assets to\\\\ncollect the contractual cash flows if it is to qualify for amortised cost\\\\nclassification.

To make this determination, an entity must consider\\\\nthe possible effect of the contractual cash flow characteristic in each reporting\\\\nperiod and cumulatively over the life of the financial instrument.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, if a contractual cash flow characteristic could have an effect on the\\\\ncontractual cash flows that is more than de minimis (either in a single reporting\\\\nperiod or cumulatively) but that cash flow characteristic is not genuine, it does\\\\nnot affect the classification of a financial asset. A cash flow characteristic is\\\\nnot genuine if it affects the instrument\\\\u2019s contractual cash flows only on the\\\\noccurrence of an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely\\\\nto occur.\\\\n\\\\nHow we see it\\\\nAlthough the de minimis and non-genuine thresholds are high hurdles,\\\\nallowing entities to disregard such features will result in more debt\\\\ninstruments qualifying for the amortised cost or FVOCI measurement\\\\ncategories than in previous versions of IFRS 9.

The standard describes such time value of\\\\nmoney elements as \\\\u2018imperfect\\\\u2019.14 In such cases, an entity must assess the\\\\nmodification to determine whether the contractual cash flows represent solely\\\\npayments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding.
