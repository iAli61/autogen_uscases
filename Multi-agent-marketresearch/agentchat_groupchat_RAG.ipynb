However, an\\nentity must consider\\ninformation about how\\ncash flows were realised in\\nthe past, together with all\\nother relevant information.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 8\\n\\n3.1 Holding-to-collect contractual cash flows5\\n\\nFinancial assets that are held within a business model with the objective of\\nholding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows are measured at\\namortised cost (provided the asset also meets the contractual cash flow test).\\nSuch assets are managed to realise cash flows by collecting contractual\\npayments over the life of the instrument.\\n\\nIn determining whether cash flows are going to be realised by collecting the\\nfinancial assets\\u2019 contractual cash flows, it is necessary to consider the\\nfrequency and value of sales in prior periods, whether the sales were of assets\\nclose to maturity, the reasons for those sales, and expectations about future\\nsales activity. However, the standard states that sales, in themselves, do not\\ndetermine the business model and cannot be considered in isolation. It goes on\\nto say that, instead, information about past sales and expectations about future\\nsales provide evidence related to how the entity\\u2019s stated objective for managing\\nthe financial assets is achieved and, specifically, how cash flows are realised.\\nAn entity must consider information about past sales in terms of the reasons for\\nthe sales and the conditions that existed at that time compared to current\\nconditions.\\n\\nBased on these considerations, an entity needs to determine the predictive\\nvalue of the past sales for the expectations of future sales. When performing\\nthis assessment, the standard makes it clear that it is irrelevant whether a third\\nparty (such as a banking regulator in the case of some liquidity portfolios held\\nby banks) imposes the requirement to sell the financial assets, or whether that\\nactivity is at the entity\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nHow we see it\\nIFRS 9 is unclear concerning the role of sales, when it says that \\u2018sales in\\nthemselves do not determine the business model\\u2019, the emphasis seems to be\\non past sales. Given the requirements in the standard, the magnitude and\\nfrequency of sales is certainly important evidence in determining an entity\\u2019s\\nbusiness models. However, the key point is that the standard requires the\\nconsideration of expected future sales while past sales are of relevance only\\nas a source of evidence. Unlike the held-to-maturity classification under\\nIAS 39, there is no concept of \\u2018tainting\\u2019.\\n\\n3.2 Holding-to-collect contractual cash flows and selling6\\n\\nThe FVOCI measurement category is mandatory for portfolios of financial assets\\nthat are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both\\ncollecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (provided the asset\\nalso meets the contractual cash flow test).\\n\\nIn this type of business model, the entity\\u2019s key management personnel has\\nmade a decision that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling are\\nfundamental to achieving the objective of the business model. There are various\\nobjectives that may be consistent with this type of business model. For example,\\nthe objective of the business model may be to manage everyday liquidity needs,\\nto achieve a particular interest yield profile or to match the duration of financial\\nassets to the duration of the liabilities that those assets are funding. To achieve\\nthese objectives, the entity will both collect contractual cash flows and sell the\\nfinancial assets.\\n\\n5 Refer to questions Q3-Q9 and Q13-Q19 in the Appendix to this publication\\n6 Refer to questions Q10-Q13 and Q17 in the Appendix to this publication\\n\\nPast sales and\\nexpectations about future\\nsales are important\\naspects to how the entity\\u2019s\\nstated objective for\\nmanaging the financial\\nassets is achieved.\\n\\n\\n\\n9 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\n\\nCompared to the business model with an objective to hold financial assets to\\ncollect contractual cash flows, this business model will typically involve greater\\nfrequency and value of sales. This is because selling financial assets is integral\\nto achieving the business model's objective rather than only incidental to it\n",
      "These assets are not held\\nfor trading, but individual assets are sold if the portfolio manager believes he or\\nshe can reinvest the funds in assets with a higher yield. As a result, a more than\\ninfrequent number of sales that are significant in value are anticipated for this\\nportfolio and it is unlikely that this portfolio would meet the amortised cost\\ncriteria if it were assessed on a stand-alone basis.\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe bank will need to exercise judgement to determine the appropriate level at\\nwhich to assess its business model(s). Hence, different conclusions are possible\\ndepending on the facts and circumstances.\\n\\nThis does not mean that the bank has an accounting policy choice, but it is,\\nrather, a matter of fact that can be observed by the way the organisation is\\nstructured and managed. In many organisations, key management personnel\\nmay determine the overall strategy and then delegate their authority for\\nexecuting the strategy to others. The combination of the overall strategy and\\nthe effect of the delegated authority are among the factors that can be\\nconsidered in the determination of business models.\\n\\nIn the specified fact pattern, the determining factor is whether the fifth\\nsubsidiary is managed independently from the other four subsidiaries (and\\nperformance is assessed and management is compensated accordingly). If it is\\nseparately managed, the number of business models is three (i.e., investment\\nbanking, one business model for the first four subsidiaries and a second\\nbusiness model for the fifth subsidiary). If not, the number of business models is\\ntwo (i.e., one for retail banking and one for investment banking). In the case of\\ntwo business models, all of the debt securities held by the retail banking\\nbusiness would be accounted for at FVOCI.\\n\\nImpact of sales on the assessment\\n\\nGeneral considerations\\n\\nQ3: How do past sales influence the business models of an entity and the\\nassets held within those business models?\\n\\nAdditional information\\n\\nAn entity initially assesses its business model as qualifying for amortised cost\\nmeasurement, but assets are subsequently sold for reasons that were not\\npreviously anticipated.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 32\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nAn increase in the frequency or value of sales in a particular period is not\\nnecessarily inconsistent with an objective to hold financial assets in order to\\ncollect contractual cash flows, if an entity can explain the reasons for the sales\\nand demonstrate why they sales do not reflect a change in the entity\\u2019s business\\nmodel and, hence, sales will in future be lower in frequency or value.\\n\\nThis assessment is about expectations and not about intent. For instance, the\\nfact that it is not the entity\\u2019s objective to realise fair value gains or losses is not\\nsufficient in itself to be able to conclude that measurement at amortised cost is\\nappropriate.\\n\\nIf the entity comes to the conclusion that sales will be more than infrequent\\n(and significant in value) in the future, the objective of the business model is\\nrather to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and to sell\\nfinancial assets. Newly acquired financial assets under this business model will\\nneed to be accounted for at FVOCI, whereas existing financial assets remain\\nmeasured at amortised cost.\\n\\nExisting financial assets are only reclassified in case of a change in business\\nmodel. However, this is expected to happen only \\u2018very infrequently\\u2019, for\\ninstance, when an entity begins or ceases an activity that is significant to its\\noperations. The examples given in the standard involve the acquisition, disposal\\nor shutting down of business lines. Unanticipated sales are very unlikely to meet\\nthat hurdle.\\n\\nQ4: How will an entity interpret \\u2018infrequent\\u2019 and \\u2018insignificant\\u2019?\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nIFRS 9 requires that if more than an infrequent number of sales is made out of a\\nportfolio and those sales are more than insignificant in value (either individually\\nor in aggregate), the entity needs to assess whether and how such sales are\\nconsistent with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows.\\n\\nHowever, IFRS 9 does not explain how \\u2018infrequent\\u2019 and \\u2018insignificant\\u2019 should be\\ninterpreted\n",

      "The Board noted that, because the underlying pool of assets must have\\ncontractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, then,\\nby extension, any prepayment features in those underlying financial assets must\\nalso be solely payments of principal and interest.24\\n\\nHow we see it\\nThe Board\\u2019s clarification that a prepayment feature in the underlying pool of\\nassets does not necessarily prevent a tranche from meeting the SPPI criteria\\nis helpful. But, unless the underlying pool can only be acquired at origination,\\nit may be very difficult to \\u2018look through\\u2019 to the underlying pool to determine\\nif its prepayment features would themselves be solely payments of principal\\nand interest. This is because the information will often not be available to\\ndetermine whether the assets were acquired at a premium or discount and\\nwhether the fair value of any prepayment feature was insignificant on\\nacquisition (see 4.3.4).\\n\\n4.4.1 Assessing the characteristics of the underlying pool\\n\\nFor the purposes of criterion (b) in 4.4 above, the underlying pool may contain\\nfinancial assets or liabilities such as interest rate swaps. In order for these\\ninstruments not to preclude the use of amortised cost or FVOCI accounting for\\nholders of a tranche, they must reduce the variability of cash flows, or align the\\ncash flows of the tranches with the cash flows of the underlying pool of the\\nprimary instruments. If the underlying pool of financial instruments contained a\\npurchased credit default swap, this would not preclude the use of amortised\\ncost or FVOCI accounting provided it paid out only to compensate for the loss\\nof principal and interest, although, in practice, it is far more common for\\nunderlying pools to contain written rather than purchased credit default swaps.\\nAs a consequence, it may well be possible to obtain amortised cost or FVOCI\\naccounting treatment for the more senior investments in cash CDOs, i.e., those\\nfor which the underlying pool comprises the reference debt instruments.\\nHowever, senior tranches of synthetic CDOs, for which the risk exposure of the\\ntranches is generated by derivatives, would not pass the SPPI test.\\n\\n4.4.2 Assessing the exposure to credit risk in the tranche held25\\n\\nIFRS 9 does not prescribe a method for comparing the exposure to credit risk in\\nthe tranche held to that of the underlying pool of financial instruments.\\n\\n23 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.206.\\n24 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.206(a).\\n25 Refer to question Q46 in the Appendix to this publication.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 20\\n\\nFor the more senior and junior tranches, it may become obvious, after relatively\\nlittle analysis, whether the tranche is more or less risky than the underlying\\nassets. In some cases, it may be possible to compare the credit rating allocated\\nto the tranche with that for the underlying pool of financial instruments,\\nprovided they are all rated.\\n\\nHowever, in some circumstances involving complex securitisation structures, a\\nmore detailed assessment may be required. For example, it might be\\nappropriate to prepare an analysis that involves developing various credit loss\\nscenarios for the underlying pool of financial instruments, computing the\\nprobability-weighted outcomes of those scenarios, determining the\\nprobability-weighted effect on the tranche held, and comparing the relative\\nvariability of the tranche held with that of the underlying assets.\\n\\n5. Classifying financial liabilities26\\n\\nThe classification of financial liabilities under IFRS9 does not follow the\\napproach for the classification of financial assets, rather it remains broadly\\nthe same as under IAS 39. Except for financial guarantee contracts and loan\\ncommitments that are scoped out of the standard, financial liabilities are\\nmeasured either at FVTPL or at amortised cost.\\n\\nFinancial liabilities are measured at FVTPL when they meet the definition of held\\nfor trading or when they are designated as such on initial recognition using the\\nfair value option (see section 6)\n",
      ", that results in a more than an infrequent number of sales), so\\nthat the business model would no longer qualify for amortised cost accounting,\\nthe question of how the entity should measure the existing assets and any\\nnewly acquired assets then arises.\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nAlthough more than an infrequent number of sales have occurred, unless there\\nhas been a fundamental change in the entity\\u2019s business model, the requirements\\nof the standard regarding reclassification are unlikely to be triggered. Changes\\nin the business model for managing financial assets that trigger reclassification\\nof financial assets must be significant to the entity's operations and\\ndemonstrable to external parties. They are expected to be very infrequent.\\n\\nAssuming that the assets are not reclassified, it is likely that the entity will have\\nto divide the portfolio into two sub-portfolios going forward \\u2014 one for the old\\nassets and one for any new assets acquired.\\n\\nFinancial assets previously recognised will remain at amortised cost. New\\nfinancial assets acquired will be measured at FVTPL or at FVOCI. Whether the\\nassets are measured at FVTPL or FVOCI depends on the new business model\\nand the characteristics of the assets.\\n\\nThe date for recording reclassifications\\n\\nQ54: An entity changes its business model during the year, and is required\\nto reclassify all affected financial assets. When is the reclassification\\nrecorded?\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nA change in the entity\\u2019s business model must be accounted for prospectively\\nfrom the reclassification date, which is defined in the standard as \\u2018the first\\nday of the first reporting period following the change in business model\\u2019.\\n\\nFor example, an entity with a reporting year-end of 31 December might\\ndetermine that there is a change in its business model in August.\\n\\nIf the entity prepares and publishes quarterly reports under IFRS, it should\\napply the old classification up to 30 September and, as of 1 October, reclassify\\nall affected financial assets and apply the new classification prospectively from\\nthat date. However, if the entity only prepares annual accounts, the entity is\\nrequired to reclassify all affected financial assets and apply the new\\nclassification as of 1 January of the following year.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 62\\n\\nChanges in a financial asset\\u2019s characteristics\\n\\nQ55: Is reclassification permitted or required when the characteristics of a\\nfinancial asset change, e.g., when the conversion option of a\\nconvertible bond lapses? Does the answer differ if the convertible\\nbond is converted into shares of the issuer?\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nReclassifications are neither permitted nor required when the characteristics of\\na financial asset vary over the asset\\u2019s life based on its original contractual\\nterms. Unlike a change in the business model, the contractual terms of a\\nfinancial asset are known at initial recognition and an entity classifies the\\nfinancial asset at initial recognition based on the contractual terms over the life\\nof the instrument.62\\n\\nThus, no reclassification is permitted or required when, for instance, the\\nconversion option of a convertible bond lapses. If, however, a convertible bond\\nis converted into shares, the shares represent a new financial asset to be\\nrecognised by the entity. The entity would then need to determine the\\nclassification category for the new equity investment.\\n\\nEffective date and transition\\nThe standard\\u2019s date of initial application\\n\\nQ56: What is the date of initial application of IFRS 9?\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nIf IFRS 9 is adopted in 2016 or 2017, the date of initial application will be the\\nfirst day of the reporting period in which it is adopted. For an entity that\\npublishes quarterly financial statements that comply with IAS 34, we consider\\nreporting period to include interim periods and not only annual reporting\\nperiods. Hence, such an entity could designate the start of any quarterly period\\nas its date of initial application.\\n\\nHowever, for entities that do not adopt IFRS 9 early, the date of initial application\\nwill be the start of the annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2018\n",

      "\\nThere is no threshold for the frequency or value of sales that can or must occur\\nin this business model.\\n\\n3.3 FVTPL business models7\\n\\nIFRS 9 requires financial assets to be measured at FVTPL if they are not held\\nwithin either a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect\\ncontractual cash flows or within a business model whose objective is achieved\\nby both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. A business\\nmodel that results in measurement at FVTPL is where the financial assets are\\nheld for trading. Another is where the assets are managed on a fair value basis.\\nIn each case, the entity manages the financial assets with the objective of\\nrealising cash flows through the sale of the assets. The entity makes decisions\\nbased on the assets\\u2019 fair values and manages the assets to realise those fair\\nvalues. As consequence, the entity\\u2019s objective will typically result in active\\nbuying and selling.\\n\\nHow we see it\\nAs set out in IFRS 9, FVOCI is a defined category and is neither a residual nor\\nan election. However, in practice, entities may identify those debt\\ninstruments that are held to collect contractual cash flows, those that are\\nheld for trading, those managed on a fair value basis and those for which the\\nentity applies the fair value option to avoid a measurement mismatch, and\\nthen measure the remaining debt instruments at FVOCI. As a consequence,\\nthe FVOCI category might, in effect, be used as a residual, just because it is\\nfar easier to articulate business models that would be classified at amortised\\ncost or at FVTPL.\\n\\n4 Characteristics of the contractual cash flows\\nof the instrument\\n\\nThe assessment of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows aims to\\nidentify whether the contractual cash flows are \\u2018solely payments of principal and\\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding\\u2019. Hence, the assessment is\\ncolloquially referred to as the \\u2018SPPI test\\u2019.\\n\\nThe SPPI test is designed to screen out financial assets on which the application\\nof the effective interest method (EIM) either is not viable from a pure\\nmechanical standpoint or does not provide useful information about the\\nuncertainty, timing and amount of the financial asset\\u2019s contractual cash flows.\\n\\nBecause the EIM is essentially an allocation mechanism that spreads interest\\nrevenue or expense over time, amortised cost or FVOCI measurement is only\\nappropriate for simple cash flows that have low variability such as those of \\u2018plain\\nvanilla\\u2019 loans and receivables and debt securities. Accordingly, the SPPI test is\\nbased on the premise that it is only when the variability in the contractual cash\\nflows arises to maintain the holder\\u2019s return in line with a \\u2018basic lending\\narrangement\\u2019 that the application of the EIM provides useful information.\\n\\n7 Refer to questions Q17-Q20 in the Appendix to this publication.\\n\\nThe IASB believes that\\namortised cost would\\nprovide relevant and\\nuseful information as long\\nas the contractual cash\\nflows do not introduce\\nrisks or volatility that are\\ninconsistent with a basic\\nlending arrangement.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 10\\n\\nIn this context, the term \\u2018basic lending arrangement\\u2019 is used broadly to capture\\nboth originated and acquired financial assets, the lender or the holder of which is\\nlooking to earn a return that compensates primarily for the time value of money\\nand credit risk. However, such an arrangement can also include other elements\\nthat provide consideration for other basic lending risks such as liquidity risks,\\ncosts associated with holding the financial asset for a period of time (e.g.,\\nservicing or administrative costs) and can also include a profit margin.\\n\\nIn contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimis exposure\\n(see section 4.3.1) to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that is\\nunrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity\\nprices or commodity prices, do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are\\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding\n",

However, an\\\\nentity must consider\\\\ninformation about how\\\\ncash flows were realised in\\\\nthe past, together with all\\\\nother relevant information.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 8\\\\n\\\\n3.1 Holding-to-collect contractual cash flows5\\\\n\\\\nFinancial assets that are held within a business model with the objective of\\\\nholding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows are measured at\\\\namortised cost (provided the asset also meets the contractual cash flow test).\\\\nSuch assets are managed to realise cash flows by collecting contractual\\\\npayments over the life of the instrument.\\\\n\\\\nIn determining whether cash flows are going to be realised by collecting the\\\\nfinancial assets\\\\u2019 contractual cash flows, it is necessary to consider the\\\\nfrequency and value of sales in prior periods, whether the sales were of assets\\\\nclose to maturity, the reasons for those sales, and expectations about future\\\\nsales activity. However, the standard states that sales, in themselves, do not\\\\ndetermine the business model and cannot be considered in isolation. It goes on\\\\nto say that, instead, information about past sales and expectations about future\\\\nsales provide evidence related to how the entity\\\\u2019s stated objective for managing\\\\nthe financial assets is achieved and, specifically, how cash flows are realised.\\\\nAn entity must consider information about past sales in terms of the reasons for\\\\nthe sales and the conditions that existed at that time compared to current\\\\nconditions.\\\\n\\\\nBased on these considerations, an entity needs to determine the predictive\\\\nvalue of the past sales for the expectations of future sales. When performing\\\\nthis assessment, the standard makes it clear that it is irrelevant whether a third\\\\nparty (such as a banking regulator in the case of some liquidity portfolios held\\\\nby banks) imposes the requirement to sell the financial assets, or whether that\\\\nactivity is at the entity\\\\u2019s discretion.\\\\n\\\\nHow we see it\\\\nIFRS 9 is unclear concerning the role of sales, when it says that \\\\u2018sales in\\\\nthemselves do not determine the business model\\\\u2019, the emphasis seems to be\\\\non past sales. Given the requirements in the standard, the magnitude and\\\\nfrequency of sales is certainly important evidence in determining an entity\\\\u2019s\\\\nbusiness models. However, the key point is that the standard requires the\\\\nconsideration of expected future sales while past sales are of relevance only\\\\nas a source of evidence. Unlike the held-to-maturity classification under\\\\nIAS 39, there is no concept of \\\\u2018tainting\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\n3.2 Holding-to-collect contractual cash flows and selling6\\\\n\\\\nThe FVOCI measurement category is mandatory for portfolios of financial assets\\\\nthat are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both\\\\ncollecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (provided the asset\\\\nalso meets the contractual cash flow test).\\\\n\\\\nIn this type of business model, the entity\\\\u2019s key management personnel has\\\\nmade a decision that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling are\\\\nfundamental to achieving the objective of the business model. There are various\\\\nobjectives that may be consistent with this type of business model. For example,\\\\nthe objective of the business model may be to manage everyday liquidity needs,\\\\nto achieve a particular interest yield profile or to match the duration of financial\\\\nassets to the duration of the liabilities that those assets are funding. To achieve\\\\nthese objectives, the entity will both collect contractual cash flows and sell the\\\\nfinancial assets.\\\\n\\\\n5 Refer to questions Q3-Q9 and Q13-Q19 in the Appendix to this publication\\\\n6 Refer to questions Q10-Q13 and Q17 in the Appendix to this publication\\\\n\\\\nPast sales and\\\\nexpectations about future\\\\nsales are important\\\\naspects to how the entity\\\\u2019s\\\\nstated objective for\\\\nmanaging the financial\\\\nassets is achieved.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n9 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nCompared to the business model with an objective to hold financial assets to\\\\ncollect contractual cash flows, this business model will typically involve greater\\\\nfrequency and value of sales. This is because selling financial assets is integral\\\\nto achieving the business model\\'s objective rather than only incidental to it\\nThese assets are not held\\\\nfor trading, but individual assets are sold if the portfolio manager believes he or\\\\nshe can reinvest the funds in assets with a higher yield. As a result, a more than\\\\ninfrequent number of sales that are significant in value are anticipated for this\\\\nportfolio and it is unlikely that this portfolio would meet the amortised cost\\\\ncriteria if it were assessed on a stand-alone basis.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nThe bank will need to exercise judgement to determine the appropriate level at\\\\nwhich to assess its business model(s). Hence, different conclusions are possible\\\\ndepending on the facts and circumstances.\\\\n\\\\nThis does not mean that the bank has an accounting policy choice, but it is,\\\\nrather, a matter of fact that can be observed by the way the organisation is\\\\nstructured and managed. In many organisations, key management personnel\\\\nmay determine the overall strategy and then delegate their authority for\\\\nexecuting the strategy to others. The combination of the overall strategy and\\\\nthe effect of the delegated authority are among the factors that can be\\\\nconsidered in the determination of business models.\\\\n\\\\nIn the specified fact pattern, the determining factor is whether the fifth\\\\nsubsidiary is managed independently from the other four subsidiaries (and\\\\nperformance is assessed and management is compensated accordingly). If it is\\\\nseparately managed, the number of business models is three (i.e., investment\\\\nbanking, one business model for the first four subsidiaries and a second\\\\nbusiness model for the fifth subsidiary). If not, the number of business models is\\\\ntwo (i.e., one for retail banking and one for investment banking). In the case of\\\\ntwo business models, all of the debt securities held by the retail banking\\\\nbusiness would be accounted for at FVOCI.\\\\n\\\\nImpact of sales on the assessment\\\\n\\\\nGeneral considerations\\\\n\\\\nQ3: How do past sales influence the business models of an entity and the\\\\nassets held within those business models?\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nAn entity initially assesses its business model as qualifying for amortised cost\\\\nmeasurement, but assets are subsequently sold for reasons that were not\\\\npreviously anticipated.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 32\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nAn increase in the frequency or value of sales in a particular period is not\\\\nnecessarily inconsistent with an objective to hold financial assets in order to\\\\ncollect contractual cash flows, if an entity can explain the reasons for the sales\\\\nand demonstrate why they sales do not reflect a change in the entity\\\\u2019s business\\\\nmodel and, hence, sales will in future be lower in frequency or value.\\\\n\\\\nThis assessment is about expectations and not about intent. For instance, the\\\\nfact that it is not the entity\\\\u2019s objective to realise fair value gains or losses is not\\\\nsufficient in itself to be able to conclude that measurement at amortised cost is\\\\nappropriate.\\\\n\\\\nIf the entity comes to the conclusion that sales will be more than infrequent\\\\n(and significant in value) in the future, the objective of the business model is\\\\nrather to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and to sell\\\\nfinancial assets. Newly acquired financial assets under this business model will\\\\nneed to be accounted for at FVOCI, whereas existing financial assets remain\\\\nmeasured at amortised cost.\\\\n\\\\nExisting financial assets are only reclassified in case of a change in business\\\\nmodel. However, this is expected to happen only \\\\u2018very infrequently\\\\u2019, for\\\\ninstance, when an entity begins or ceases an activity that is significant to its\\\\noperations. The examples given in the standard involve the acquisition, disposal\\\\nor shutting down of business lines. Unanticipated sales are very unlikely to meet\\\\nthat hurdle.\\\\n\\\\nQ4: How will an entity interpret \\\\u2018infrequent\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018insignificant\\\\u2019?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nIFRS 9 requires that if more than an infrequent number of sales is made out of a\\\\nportfolio and those sales are more than insignificant in value (either individually\\\\nor in aggregate), the entity needs to assess whether and how such sales are\\\\nconsistent with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, IFRS 9 does not explain how \\\\u2018infrequent\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018insignificant\\\\u2019 should be\\\\ninterpreted\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe transition guidance in paragraph 7.2.4 of IFRS 9 provides that an entity\\\\nshould assess the business model based on the facts and circumstances that\\\\nexist at the date of initial application, and that the resulting classification should\\\\nbe applied retrospectively. However, this transition relief is not extended to the\\\\nSPPI test.\\\\n\\\\n64 See paragraph IFRS 9.3.1.1.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAbout EY\\\\nEY is a global leader in assurance, tax, transaction and advisory services. \\\\nThe insights and quality services we deliver help build trust and confidence \\\\nin the capital markets and in economies the world over.

But, unless the underlying pool can only be acquired at origination,\\\\nit may be very difficult to \\\\u2018look through\\\\u2019 to the underlying pool to determine\\\\nif its prepayment features would themselves be solely payments of principal\\\\nand interest. This is because the information will often not be available to\\\\ndetermine whether the assets were acquired at a premium or discount and\\\\nwhether the fair value of any prepayment feature was insignificant on\\\\nacquisition (see 4.3.4).\\\\n\\\\n4.4.1 Assessing the characteristics of the underlying pool\\\\n\\\\nFor the purposes of criterion (b) in 4.4 above, the underlying pool may contain\\\\nfinancial assets or liabilities such as interest rate swaps. In order for these\\\\ninstruments not to preclude the use of amortised cost or FVOCI accounting for\\\\nholders of a tranche, they must reduce the variability of cash flows, or align the\\\\ncash flows of the tranches with the cash flows of the underlying pool of the\\\\nprimary instruments. If the underlying pool of financial instruments contained a\\\\npurchased credit default swap, this would not preclude the use of amortised\\\\ncost or FVOCI accounting provided it paid out only to compensate for the loss\\\\nof principal and interest, although, in practice, it is far more common for\\\\nunderlying pools to contain written rather than purchased credit default swaps.\\\\nAs a consequence, it may well be possible to obtain amortised cost or FVOCI\\\\naccounting treatment for the more senior investments in cash CDOs, i.e., those\\\\nfor which the underlying pool comprises the reference debt instruments.\\\\nHowever, senior tranches of synthetic CDOs, for which the risk exposure of the\\\\ntranches is generated by derivatives, would not pass the SPPI test.\\\\n\\\\n4.4.2 Assessing the exposure to credit risk in the tranche held25\\\\n\\\\nIFRS 9 does not prescribe a method for comparing the exposure to credit risk in\\\\nthe tranche held to that of the underlying pool of financial instruments.\\\\n\\\\n23 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.206.\\\\n24 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.206(a).\\\\n25 Refer to question Q46 in the Appendix to this publication.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 20\\\\n\\\\nFor the more senior and junior tranches, it may become obvious, after relatively\\\\nlittle analysis, whether the tranche is more or less risky than the underlying\\\\nassets. In some cases, it may be possible to compare the credit rating allocated\\\\nto the tranche with that for the underlying pool of financial instruments,\\\\nprovided they are all rated.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, in some circumstances involving complex securitisation structures, a\\\\nmore detailed assessment may be required. For example, it might be\\\\nappropriate to prepare an analysis that involves developing various credit loss\\\\nscenarios for the underlying pool of financial instruments, computing the\\\\nprobability-weighted outcomes of those scenarios, determining the\\\\nprobability-weighted effect on the tranche held, and comparing the relative\\\\nvariability of the tranche held with that of the underlying assets.\\\\n\\\\n5. Classifying financial liabilities26\\\\n\\\\nThe classification of financial liabilities under IFRS9 does not follow the\\\\napproach for the classification of financial assets, rather it remains broadly\\\\nthe same as under IAS 39. Except for financial guarantee contracts and loan\\\\ncommitments that are scoped out of the standard, financial liabilities are\\\\nmeasured either at FVTPL or at amortised cost.\\\\n\\\\nFinancial liabilities are measured at FVTPL when they meet the definition of held\\\\nfor trading or when they are designated as such on initial recognition using the\\\\nfair value option (see section 6)\\n, that results in a more than an infrequent number of sales), so\\\\nthat the business model would no longer qualify for amortised cost accounting,\\\\nthe question of how the entity should measure the existing assets and any\\\\nnewly acquired assets then arises.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nAlthough more than an infrequent number of sales have occurred, unless there\\\\nhas been a fundamental change in the entity\\\\u2019s business model, the requirements\\\\nof the standard regarding reclassification are unlikely to be triggered. Changes\\\\nin the business model for managing financial assets that trigger reclassification\\\\nof financial assets must be significant to the entity\\'s operations and\\\\ndemonstrable to external parties. They are expected to be very infrequent.\\\\n\\\\nAssuming that the assets are not reclassified, it is likely that the entity will have\\\\nto divide the portfolio into two sub-portfolios going forward \\\\u2014 one for the old\\\\nassets and one for any new assets acquired.\\\\n\\\\nFinancial assets previously recognised will remain at amortised cost. New\\\\nfinancial assets acquired will be measured at FVTPL or at FVOCI. Whether the\\\\nassets are measured at FVTPL or FVOCI depends on the new business model\\\\nand the characteristics of the assets.\\\\n\\\\nThe date for recording reclassifications\\\\n\\\\nQ54: An entity changes its business model during the year, and is required\\\\nto reclassify all affected financial assets. When is the reclassification\\\\nrecorded?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nA change in the entity\\\\u2019s business model must be accounted for prospectively\\\\nfrom the reclassification date, which is defined in the standard as \\\\u2018the first\\\\nday of the first reporting period following the change in business model\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, an entity with a reporting year-end of 31 December might\\\\ndetermine that there is a change in its business model in August.\\\\n\\\\nIf the entity prepares and publishes quarterly reports under IFRS, it should\\\\napply the old classification up to 30 September and, as of 1 October, reclassify\\\\nall affected financial assets and apply the new classification prospectively from\\\\nthat date. However, if the entity only prepares annual accounts, the entity is\\\\nrequired to reclassify all affected financial assets and apply the new\\\\nclassification as of 1 January of the following year.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 62\\\\n\\\\nChanges in a financial asset\\\\u2019s characteristics\\\\n\\\\nQ55: Is reclassification permitted or required when the characteristics of a\\\\nfinancial asset change, e.g., when the conversion option of a\\\\nconvertible bond lapses? Does the answer differ if the convertible\\\\nbond is converted into shares of the issuer?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nReclassifications are neither permitted nor required when the characteristics of\\\\na financial asset vary over the asset\\\\u2019s life based on its original contractual\\\\nterms. Unlike a change in the business model, the contractual terms of a\\\\nfinancial asset are known at initial recognition and an entity classifies the\\\\nfinancial asset at initial recognition based on the contractual terms over the life\\\\nof the instrument.62\\\\n\\\\nThus, no reclassification is permitted or required when, for instance, the\\\\nconversion option of a convertible bond lapses. If, however, a convertible bond\\\\nis converted into shares, the shares represent a new financial asset to be\\\\nrecognised by the entity. The entity would then need to determine the\\\\nclassification category for the new equity investment.\\\\n\\\\nEffective date and transition\\\\nThe standard\\\\u2019s date of initial application\\\\n\\\\nQ56: What is the date of initial application of IFRS 9?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nIf IFRS 9 is adopted in 2016 or 2017, the date of initial application will be the\\\\nfirst day of the reporting period in which it is adopted. For an entity that\\\\npublishes quarterly financial statements that comply with IAS 34, we consider\\\\nreporting period to include interim periods and not only annual reporting\\\\nperiods. Hence, such an entity could designate the start of any quarterly period\\\\nas its date of initial application.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, for entities that do not adopt IFRS 9 early, the date of initial application\\\\nwill be the start of the annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2018\\n\"\\\\nApplying IFRS\\\\n\\\\nClassification of financial \\\\ninstruments under IFRS 9\\\\nMay 2015\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nContents\\\\n\\\\n1.

A business\\\\nmodel that results in measurement at FVTPL is where the financial assets are\\\\nheld for trading. Another is where the assets are managed on a fair value basis.\\\\nIn each case, the entity manages the financial assets with the objective of\\\\nrealising cash flows through the sale of the assets. The entity makes decisions\\\\nbased on the assets\\\\u2019 fair values and manages the assets to realise those fair\\\\nvalues. As consequence, the entity\\\\u2019s objective will typically result in active\\\\nbuying and selling.\\\\n\\\\nHow we see it\\\\nAs set out in IFRS 9, FVOCI is a defined category and is neither a residual nor\\\\nan election. However, in practice, entities may identify those debt\\\\ninstruments that are held to collect contractual cash flows, those that are\\\\nheld for trading, those managed on a fair value basis and those for which the\\\\nentity applies the fair value option to avoid a measurement mismatch, and\\\\nthen measure the remaining debt instruments at FVOCI. As a consequence,\\\\nthe FVOCI category might, in effect, be used as a residual, just because it is\\\\nfar easier to articulate business models that would be classified at amortised\\\\ncost or at FVTPL.\\\\n\\\\n4 Characteristics of the contractual cash flows\\\\nof the instrument\\\\n\\\\nThe assessment of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows aims to\\\\nidentify whether the contractual cash flows are \\\\u2018solely payments of principal and\\\\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding\\\\u2019. Hence, the assessment is\\\\ncolloquially referred to as the \\\\u2018SPPI test\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nThe SPPI test is designed to screen out financial assets on which the application\\\\nof the effective interest method (EIM) either is not viable from a pure\\\\nmechanical standpoint or does not provide useful information about the\\\\nuncertainty, timing and amount of the financial asset\\\\u2019s contractual cash flows.\\\\n\\\\nBecause the EIM is essentially an allocation mechanism that spreads interest\\\\nrevenue or expense over time, amortised cost or FVOCI measurement is only\\\\nappropriate for simple cash flows that have low variability such as those of \\\\u2018plain\\\\nvanilla\\\\u2019 loans and receivables and debt securities. Accordingly, the SPPI test is\\\\nbased on the premise that it is only when the variability in the contractual cash\\\\nflows arises to maintain the holder\\\\u2019s return in line with a \\\\u2018basic lending\\\\narrangement\\\\u2019 that the application of the EIM provides useful information.\\\\n\\\\n7 Refer to questions Q17-Q20 in the Appendix to this publication.\\\\n\\\\nThe IASB believes that\\\\namortised cost would\\\\nprovide relevant and\\\\nuseful information as long\\\\nas the contractual cash\\\\nflows do not introduce\\\\nrisks or volatility that are\\\\ninconsistent with a basic\\\\nlending arrangement.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 10\\\\n\\\\nIn this context, the term \\\\u2018basic lending arrangement\\\\u2019 is used broadly to capture\\\\nboth originated and acquired financial assets, the lender or the holder of which is\\\\nlooking to earn a return that compensates primarily for the time value of money\\\\nand credit risk. However, such an arrangement can also include other elements\\\\nthat provide consideration for other basic lending risks such as liquidity risks,\\\\ncosts associated with holding the financial asset for a period of time (e.g.,\\\\nservicing or administrative costs) and can also include a profit margin.\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimis exposure\\\\n(see section 4.3.1) to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that is\\\\nunrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity\\\\nprices or commodity prices, do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are\\\\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding\\n\\n', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'FVOCI stands for Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income.

However, an\\\\nentity must consider\\\\ninformation about how\\\\ncash flows were realised in\\\\nthe past, together with all\\\\nother relevant information.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 8\\\\n\\\\n3.1 Holding-to-collect contractual cash flows5\\\\n\\\\nFinancial assets that are held within a business model with the objective of\\\\nholding assets in order to collect contractual cash flows are measured at\\\\namortised cost (provided the asset also meets the contractual cash flow test).\\\\nSuch assets are managed to realise cash flows by collecting contractual\\\\npayments over the life of the instrument.\\\\n\\\\nIn determining whether cash flows are going to be realised by collecting the\\\\nfinancial assets\\\\u2019 contractual cash flows, it is necessary to consider the\\\\nfrequency and value of sales in prior periods, whether the sales were of assets\\\\nclose to maturity, the reasons for those sales, and expectations about future\\\\nsales activity. However, the standard states that sales, in themselves, do not\\\\ndetermine the business model and cannot be considered in isolation. It goes on\\\\nto say that, instead, information about past sales and expectations about future\\\\nsales provide evidence related to how the entity\\\\u2019s stated objective for managing\\\\nthe financial assets is achieved and, specifically, how cash flows are realised.\\\\nAn entity must consider information about past sales in terms of the reasons for\\\\nthe sales and the conditions that existed at that time compared to current\\\\nconditions.\\\\n\\\\nBased on these considerations, an entity needs to determine the predictive\\\\nvalue of the past sales for the expectations of future sales. When performing\\\\nthis assessment, the standard makes it clear that it is irrelevant whether a third\\\\nparty (such as a banking regulator in the case of some liquidity portfolios held\\\\nby banks) imposes the requirement to sell the financial assets, or whether that\\\\nactivity is at the entity\\\\u2019s discretion.\\\\n\\\\nHow we see it\\\\nIFRS 9 is unclear concerning the role of sales, when it says that \\\\u2018sales in\\\\nthemselves do not determine the business model\\\\u2019, the emphasis seems to be\\\\non past sales. Given the requirements in the standard, the magnitude and\\\\nfrequency of sales is certainly important evidence in determining an entity\\\\u2019s\\\\nbusiness models. However, the key point is that the standard requires the\\\\nconsideration of expected future sales while past sales are of relevance only\\\\nas a source of evidence. Unlike the held-to-maturity classification under\\\\nIAS 39, there is no concept of \\\\u2018tainting\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\n3.2 Holding-to-collect contractual cash flows and selling6\\\\n\\\\nThe FVOCI measurement category is mandatory for portfolios of financial assets\\\\nthat are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both\\\\ncollecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (provided the asset\\\\nalso meets the contractual cash flow test).\\\\n\\\\nIn this type of business model, the entity\\\\u2019s key management personnel has\\\\nmade a decision that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling are\\\\nfundamental to achieving the objective of the business model. There are various\\\\nobjectives that may be consistent with this type of business model. For example,\\\\nthe objective of the business model may be to manage everyday liquidity needs,\\\\nto achieve a particular interest yield profile or to match the duration of financial\\\\nassets to the duration of the liabilities that those assets are funding. To achieve\\\\nthese objectives, the entity will both collect contractual cash flows and sell the\\\\nfinancial assets.\\\\n\\\\n5 Refer to questions Q3-Q9 and Q13-Q19 in the Appendix to this publication\\\\n6 Refer to questions Q10-Q13 and Q17 in the Appendix to this publication\\\\n\\\\nPast sales and\\\\nexpectations about future\\\\nsales are important\\\\naspects to how the entity\\\\u2019s\\\\nstated objective for\\\\nmanaging the financial\\\\nassets is achieved.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n9 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nCompared to the business model with an objective to hold financial assets to\\\\ncollect contractual cash flows, this business model will typically involve greater\\\\nfrequency and value of sales. This is because selling financial assets is integral\\\\nto achieving the business model\\'s objective rather than only incidental to it\\nThese assets are not held\\\\nfor trading, but individual assets are sold if the portfolio manager believes he or\\\\nshe can reinvest the funds in assets with a higher yield. As a result, a more than\\\\ninfrequent number of sales that are significant in value are anticipated for this\\\\nportfolio and it is unlikely that this portfolio would meet the amortised cost\\\\ncriteria if it were assessed on a stand-alone basis.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nThe bank will need to exercise judgement to determine the appropriate level at\\\\nwhich to assess its business model(s). Hence, different conclusions are possible\\\\ndepending on the facts and circumstances.\\\\n\\\\nThis does not mean that the bank has an accounting policy choice, but it is,\\\\nrather, a matter of fact that can be observed by the way the organisation is\\\\nstructured and managed. In many organisations, key management personnel\\\\nmay determine the overall strategy and then delegate their authority for\\\\nexecuting the strategy to others. The combination of the overall strategy and\\\\nthe effect of the delegated authority are among the factors that can be\\\\nconsidered in the determination of business models.\\\\n\\\\nIn the specified fact pattern, the determining factor is whether the fifth\\\\nsubsidiary is managed independently from the other four subsidiaries (and\\\\nperformance is assessed and management is compensated accordingly). If it is\\\\nseparately managed, the number of business models is three (i.e., investment\\\\nbanking, one business model for the first four subsidiaries and a second\\\\nbusiness model for the fifth subsidiary). If not, the number of business models is\\\\ntwo (i.e., one for retail banking and one for investment banking). In the case of\\\\ntwo business models, all of the debt securities held by the retail banking\\\\nbusiness would be accounted for at FVOCI.\\\\n\\\\nImpact of sales on the assessment\\\\n\\\\nGeneral considerations\\\\n\\\\nQ3: How do past sales influence the business models of an entity and the\\\\nassets held within those business models?\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nAn entity initially assesses its business model as qualifying for amortised cost\\\\nmeasurement, but assets are subsequently sold for reasons that were not\\\\npreviously anticipated.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 32\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nAn increase in the frequency or value of sales in a particular period is not\\\\nnecessarily inconsistent with an objective to hold financial assets in order to\\\\ncollect contractual cash flows, if an entity can explain the reasons for the sales\\\\nand demonstrate why they sales do not reflect a change in the entity\\\\u2019s business\\\\nmodel and, hence, sales will in future be lower in frequency or value.\\\\n\\\\nThis assessment is about expectations and not about intent. For instance, the\\\\nfact that it is not the entity\\\\u2019s objective to realise fair value gains or losses is not\\\\nsufficient in itself to be able to conclude that measurement at amortised cost is\\\\nappropriate.\\\\n\\\\nIf the entity comes to the conclusion that sales will be more than infrequent\\\\n(and significant in value) in the future, the objective of the business model is\\\\nrather to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and to sell\\\\nfinancial assets. Newly acquired financial assets under this business model will\\\\nneed to be accounted for at FVOCI, whereas existing financial assets remain\\\\nmeasured at amortised cost.\\\\n\\\\nExisting financial assets are only reclassified in case of a change in business\\\\nmodel. However, this is expected to happen only \\\\u2018very infrequently\\\\u2019, for\\\\ninstance, when an entity begins or ceases an activity that is significant to its\\\\noperations. The examples given in the standard involve the acquisition, disposal\\\\nor shutting down of business lines. Unanticipated sales are very unlikely to meet\\\\nthat hurdle.\\\\n\\\\nQ4: How will an entity interpret \\\\u2018infrequent\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018insignificant\\\\u2019?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nIFRS 9 requires that if more than an infrequent number of sales is made out of a\\\\nportfolio and those sales are more than insignificant in value (either individually\\\\nor in aggregate), the entity needs to assess whether and how such sales are\\\\nconsistent with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, IFRS 9 does not explain how \\\\u2018infrequent\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018insignificant\\\\u2019 should be\\\\ninterpreted\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe transition guidance in paragraph 7.2.4 of IFRS 9 provides that an entity\\\\nshould assess the business model based on the facts and circumstances that\\\\nexist at the date of initial application, and that the resulting classification should\\\\nbe applied retrospectively. However, this transition relief is not extended to the\\\\nSPPI test.\\\\n\\\\n64 See paragraph IFRS 9.3.1.1.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAbout EY\\\\nEY is a global leader in assurance, tax, transaction and advisory services. \\\\nThe insights and quality services we deliver help build trust and confidence \\\\nin the capital markets and in economies the world over.

But, unless the underlying pool can only be acquired at origination,\\\\nit may be very difficult to \\\\u2018look through\\\\u2019 to the underlying pool to determine\\\\nif its prepayment features would themselves be solely payments of principal\\\\nand interest. This is because the information will often not be available to\\\\ndetermine whether the assets were acquired at a premium or discount and\\\\nwhether the fair value of any prepayment feature was insignificant on\\\\nacquisition (see 4.3.4).\\\\n\\\\n4.4.1 Assessing the characteristics of the underlying pool\\\\n\\\\nFor the purposes of criterion (b) in 4.4 above, the underlying pool may contain\\\\nfinancial assets or liabilities such as interest rate swaps. In order for these\\\\ninstruments not to preclude the use of amortised cost or FVOCI accounting for\\\\nholders of a tranche, they must reduce the variability of cash flows, or align the\\\\ncash flows of the tranches with the cash flows of the underlying pool of the\\\\nprimary instruments. If the underlying pool of financial instruments contained a\\\\npurchased credit default swap, this would not preclude the use of amortised\\\\ncost or FVOCI accounting provided it paid out only to compensate for the loss\\\\nof principal and interest, although, in practice, it is far more common for\\\\nunderlying pools to contain written rather than purchased credit default swaps.\\\\nAs a consequence, it may well be possible to obtain amortised cost or FVOCI\\\\naccounting treatment for the more senior investments in cash CDOs, i.e., those\\\\nfor which the underlying pool comprises the reference debt instruments.\\\\nHowever, senior tranches of synthetic CDOs, for which the risk exposure of the\\\\ntranches is generated by derivatives, would not pass the SPPI test.\\\\n\\\\n4.4.2 Assessing the exposure to credit risk in the tranche held25\\\\n\\\\nIFRS 9 does not prescribe a method for comparing the exposure to credit risk in\\\\nthe tranche held to that of the underlying pool of financial instruments.\\\\n\\\\n23 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.206.\\\\n24 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.206(a).\\\\n25 Refer to question Q46 in the Appendix to this publication.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 20\\\\n\\\\nFor the more senior and junior tranches, it may become obvious, after relatively\\\\nlittle analysis, whether the tranche is more or less risky than the underlying\\\\nassets. In some cases, it may be possible to compare the credit rating allocated\\\\nto the tranche with that for the underlying pool of financial instruments,\\\\nprovided they are all rated.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, in some circumstances involving complex securitisation structures, a\\\\nmore detailed assessment may be required. For example, it might be\\\\nappropriate to prepare an analysis that involves developing various credit loss\\\\nscenarios for the underlying pool of financial instruments, computing the\\\\nprobability-weighted outcomes of those scenarios, determining the\\\\nprobability-weighted effect on the tranche held, and comparing the relative\\\\nvariability of the tranche held with that of the underlying assets.\\\\n\\\\n5. Classifying financial liabilities26\\\\n\\\\nThe classification of financial liabilities under IFRS9 does not follow the\\\\napproach for the classification of financial assets, rather it remains broadly\\\\nthe same as under IAS 39. Except for financial guarantee contracts and loan\\\\ncommitments that are scoped out of the standard, financial liabilities are\\\\nmeasured either at FVTPL or at amortised cost.\\\\n\\\\nFinancial liabilities are measured at FVTPL when they meet the definition of held\\\\nfor trading or when they are designated as such on initial recognition using the\\\\nfair value option (see section 6)\\n, that results in a more than an infrequent number of sales), so\\\\nthat the business model would no longer qualify for amortised cost accounting,\\\\nthe question of how the entity should measure the existing assets and any\\\\nnewly acquired assets then arises.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nAlthough more than an infrequent number of sales have occurred, unless there\\\\nhas been a fundamental change in the entity\\\\u2019s business model, the requirements\\\\nof the standard regarding reclassification are unlikely to be triggered. Changes\\\\nin the business model for managing financial assets that trigger reclassification\\\\nof financial assets must be significant to the entity\\'s operations and\\\\ndemonstrable to external parties. They are expected to be very infrequent.\\\\n\\\\nAssuming that the assets are not reclassified, it is likely that the entity will have\\\\nto divide the portfolio into two sub-portfolios going forward \\\\u2014 one for the old\\\\nassets and one for any new assets acquired.\\\\n\\\\nFinancial assets previously recognised will remain at amortised cost. New\\\\nfinancial assets acquired will be measured at FVTPL or at FVOCI. Whether the\\\\nassets are measured at FVTPL or FVOCI depends on the new business model\\\\nand the characteristics of the assets.\\\\n\\\\nThe date for recording reclassifications\\\\n\\\\nQ54: An entity changes its business model during the year, and is required\\\\nto reclassify all affected financial assets. When is the reclassification\\\\nrecorded?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nA change in the entity\\\\u2019s business model must be accounted for prospectively\\\\nfrom the reclassification date, which is defined in the standard as \\\\u2018the first\\\\nday of the first reporting period following the change in business model\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, an entity with a reporting year-end of 31 December might\\\\ndetermine that there is a change in its business model in August.\\\\n\\\\nIf the entity prepares and publishes quarterly reports under IFRS, it should\\\\napply the old classification up to 30 September and, as of 1 October, reclassify\\\\nall affected financial assets and apply the new classification prospectively from\\\\nthat date. However, if the entity only prepares annual accounts, the entity is\\\\nrequired to reclassify all affected financial assets and apply the new\\\\nclassification as of 1 January of the following year.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 62\\\\n\\\\nChanges in a financial asset\\\\u2019s characteristics\\\\n\\\\nQ55: Is reclassification permitted or required when the characteristics of a\\\\nfinancial asset change, e.g., when the conversion option of a\\\\nconvertible bond lapses? Does the answer differ if the convertible\\\\nbond is converted into shares of the issuer?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nReclassifications are neither permitted nor required when the characteristics of\\\\na financial asset vary over the asset\\\\u2019s life based on its original contractual\\\\nterms. Unlike a change in the business model, the contractual terms of a\\\\nfinancial asset are known at initial recognition and an entity classifies the\\\\nfinancial asset at initial recognition based on the contractual terms over the life\\\\nof the instrument.62\\\\n\\\\nThus, no reclassification is permitted or required when, for instance, the\\\\nconversion option of a convertible bond lapses. If, however, a convertible bond\\\\nis converted into shares, the shares represent a new financial asset to be\\\\nrecognised by the entity. The entity would then need to determine the\\\\nclassification category for the new equity investment.\\\\n\\\\nEffective date and transition\\\\nThe standard\\\\u2019s date of initial application\\\\n\\\\nQ56: What is the date of initial application of IFRS 9?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nIf IFRS 9 is adopted in 2016 or 2017, the date of initial application will be the\\\\nfirst day of the reporting period in which it is adopted. For an entity that\\\\npublishes quarterly financial statements that comply with IAS 34, we consider\\\\nreporting period to include interim periods and not only annual reporting\\\\nperiods. Hence, such an entity could designate the start of any quarterly period\\\\nas its date of initial application.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, for entities that do not adopt IFRS 9 early, the date of initial application\\\\nwill be the start of the annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2018\\n\"\\\\nApplying IFRS\\\\n\\\\nClassification of financial \\\\ninstruments under IFRS 9\\\\nMay 2015\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nContents\\\\n\\\\n1.

A business\\\\nmodel that results in measurement at FVTPL is where the financial assets are\\\\nheld for trading. Another is where the assets are managed on a fair value basis.\\\\nIn each case, the entity manages the financial assets with the objective of\\\\nrealising cash flows through the sale of the assets. The entity makes decisions\\\\nbased on the assets\\\\u2019 fair values and manages the assets to realise those fair\\\\nvalues. As consequence, the entity\\\\u2019s objective will typically result in active\\\\nbuying and selling.\\\\n\\\\nHow we see it\\\\nAs set out in IFRS 9, FVOCI is a defined category and is neither a residual nor\\\\nan election. However, in practice, entities may identify those debt\\\\ninstruments that are held to collect contractual cash flows, those that are\\\\nheld for trading, those managed on a fair value basis and those for which the\\\\nentity applies the fair value option to avoid a measurement mismatch, and\\\\nthen measure the remaining debt instruments at FVOCI. As a consequence,\\\\nthe FVOCI category might, in effect, be used as a residual, just because it is\\\\nfar easier to articulate business models that would be classified at amortised\\\\ncost or at FVTPL.\\\\n\\\\n4 Characteristics of the contractual cash flows\\\\nof the instrument\\\\n\\\\nThe assessment of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows aims to\\\\nidentify whether the contractual cash flows are \\\\u2018solely payments of principal and\\\\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding\\\\u2019. Hence, the assessment is\\\\ncolloquially referred to as the \\\\u2018SPPI test\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nThe SPPI test is designed to screen out financial assets on which the application\\\\nof the effective interest method (EIM) either is not viable from a pure\\\\nmechanical standpoint or does not provide useful information about the\\\\nuncertainty, timing and amount of the financial asset\\\\u2019s contractual cash flows.\\\\n\\\\nBecause the EIM is essentially an allocation mechanism that spreads interest\\\\nrevenue or expense over time, amortised cost or FVOCI measurement is only\\\\nappropriate for simple cash flows that have low variability such as those of \\\\u2018plain\\\\nvanilla\\\\u2019 loans and receivables and debt securities. Accordingly, the SPPI test is\\\\nbased on the premise that it is only when the variability in the contractual cash\\\\nflows arises to maintain the holder\\\\u2019s return in line with a \\\\u2018basic lending\\\\narrangement\\\\u2019 that the application of the EIM provides useful information.\\\\n\\\\n7 Refer to questions Q17-Q20 in the Appendix to this publication.\\\\n\\\\nThe IASB believes that\\\\namortised cost would\\\\nprovide relevant and\\\\nuseful information as long\\\\nas the contractual cash\\\\nflows do not introduce\\\\nrisks or volatility that are\\\\ninconsistent with a basic\\\\nlending arrangement.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 10\\\\n\\\\nIn this context, the term \\\\u2018basic lending arrangement\\\\u2019 is used broadly to capture\\\\nboth originated and acquired financial assets, the lender or the holder of which is\\\\nlooking to earn a return that compensates primarily for the time value of money\\\\nand credit risk. However, such an arrangement can also include other elements\\\\nthat provide consideration for other basic lending risks such as liquidity risks,\\\\ncosts associated with holding the financial asset for a period of time (e.g.,\\\\nservicing or administrative costs) and can also include a profit margin.\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimis exposure\\\\n(see section 4.3.1) to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that is\\\\nunrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity\\\\nprices or commodity prices, do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are\\\\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding\\n\\n',\n",

However, the standard states that sales, in themselves, do not\\\\ndetermine the business model and cannot be considered in isolation. It goes on\\\\nto say that, instead, information about past sales and expectations about future\\\\nsales provide evidence related to how the entity\\\\u2019s stated objective for managing\\\\nthe financial assets is achieved and, specifically, how cash flows are realised.\\\\nAn entity must consider information about past sales in terms of the reasons for\\\\nthe sales and the conditions that existed at that time compared to current\\\\nconditions.\\\\n\\\\nBased on these considerations, an entity needs to determine the predictive\\\\nvalue of the past sales for the expectations of future sales. When performing\\\\nthis assessment, the standard makes it clear that it is irrelevant whether a third\\\\nparty (such as a banking regulator in the case of some liquidity portfolios held\\\\nby banks) imposes the requirement to sell the financial assets, or whether that\\\\nactivity is at the entity\\\\u2019s discretion.\\\\n\\\\nHow we see it\\\\nIFRS 9 is unclear concerning the role of sales, when it says that \\\\u2018sales in\\\\nthemselves do not determine the business model\\\\u2019, the emphasis seems to be\\\\non past sales. Given the requirements in the standard, the magnitude and\\\\nfrequency of sales is certainly important evidence in determining an entity\\\\u2019s\\\\nbusiness models. However, the key point is that the standard requires the\\\\nconsideration of expected future sales while past sales are of relevance only\\\\nas a source of evidence. Unlike the held-to-maturity classification under\\\\nIAS 39, there is no concept of \\\\u2018tainting\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\n3.2 Holding-to-collect contractual cash flows and selling6\\\\n\\\\nThe FVOCI measurement category is mandatory for portfolios of financial assets\\\\nthat are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both\\\\ncollecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (provided the asset\\\\nalso meets the contractual cash flow test).\\\\n\\\\nIn this type of business model, the entity\\\\u2019s key management personnel has\\\\nmade a decision that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling are\\\\nfundamental to achieving the objective of the business model. There are various\\\\nobjectives that may be consistent with this type of business model. For example,\\\\nthe objective of the business model may be to manage everyday liquidity needs,\\\\nto achieve a particular interest yield profile or to match the duration of financial\\\\nassets to the duration of the liabilities that those assets are funding. To achieve\\\\nthese objectives, the entity will both collect contractual cash flows and sell the\\\\nfinancial assets.\\\\n\\\\n5 Refer to questions Q3-Q9 and Q13-Q19 in the Appendix to this publication\\\\n6 Refer to questions Q10-Q13 and Q17 in the Appendix to this publication\\\\n\\\\nPast sales and\\\\nexpectations about future\\\\nsales are important\\\\naspects to how the entity\\\\u2019s\\\\nstated objective for\\\\nmanaging the financial\\\\nassets is achieved.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n9 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nCompared to the business model with an objective to hold financial assets to\\\\ncollect contractual cash flows, this business model will typically involve greater\\\\nfrequency and value of sales. This is because selling financial assets is integral\\\\nto achieving the business model\\'s objective rather than only incidental to it\\nThese assets are not held\\\\nfor trading, but individual assets are sold if the portfolio manager believes he or\\\\nshe can reinvest the funds in assets with a higher yield. As a result, a more than\\\\ninfrequent number of sales that are significant in value are anticipated for this\\\\nportfolio and it is unlikely that this portfolio would meet the amortised cost\\\\ncriteria if it were assessed on a stand-alone basis.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nThe bank will need to exercise judgement to determine the appropriate level at\\\\nwhich to assess its business model(s). Hence, different conclusions are possible\\\\ndepending on the facts and circumstances.\\\\n\\\\nThis does not mean that the bank has an accounting policy choice, but it is,\\\\nrather, a matter of fact that can be observed by the way the organisation is\\\\nstructured and managed. In many organisations, key management personnel\\\\nmay determine the overall strategy and then delegate their authority for\\\\nexecuting the strategy to others. The combination of the overall strategy and\\\\nthe effect of the delegated authority are among the factors that can be\\\\nconsidered in the determination of business models.\\\\n\\\\nIn the specified fact pattern, the determining factor is whether the fifth\\\\nsubsidiary is managed independently from the other four subsidiaries (and\\\\nperformance is assessed and management is compensated accordingly). If it is\\\\nseparately managed, the number of business models is three (i.e., investment\\\\nbanking, one business model for the first four subsidiaries and a second\\\\nbusiness model for the fifth subsidiary). If not, the number of business models is\\\\ntwo (i.e., one for retail banking and one for investment banking). In the case of\\\\ntwo business models, all of the debt securities held by the retail banking\\\\nbusiness would be accounted for at FVOCI.\\\\n\\\\nImpact of sales on the assessment\\\\n\\\\nGeneral considerations\\\\n\\\\nQ3: How do past sales influence the business models of an entity and the\\\\nassets held within those business models?\\\\n\\\\nAdditional information\\\\n\\\\nAn entity initially assesses its business model as qualifying for amortised cost\\\\nmeasurement, but assets are subsequently sold for reasons that were not\\\\npreviously anticipated.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 32\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nAn increase in the frequency or value of sales in a particular period is not\\\\nnecessarily inconsistent with an objective to hold financial assets in order to\\\\ncollect contractual cash flows, if an entity can explain the reasons for the sales\\\\nand demonstrate why they sales do not reflect a change in the entity\\\\u2019s business\\\\nmodel and, hence, sales will in future be lower in frequency or value.\\\\n\\\\nThis assessment is about expectations and not about intent. For instance, the\\\\nfact that it is not the entity\\\\u2019s objective to realise fair value gains or losses is not\\\\nsufficient in itself to be able to conclude that measurement at amortised cost is\\\\nappropriate.\\\\n\\\\nIf the entity comes to the conclusion that sales will be more than infrequent\\\\n(and significant in value) in the future, the objective of the business model is\\\\nrather to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and to sell\\\\nfinancial assets. Newly acquired financial assets under this business model will\\\\nneed to be accounted for at FVOCI, whereas existing financial assets remain\\\\nmeasured at amortised cost.\\\\n\\\\nExisting financial assets are only reclassified in case of a change in business\\\\nmodel. However, this is expected to happen only \\\\u2018very infrequently\\\\u2019, for\\\\ninstance, when an entity begins or ceases an activity that is significant to its\\\\noperations. The examples given in the standard involve the acquisition, disposal\\\\nor shutting down of business lines. Unanticipated sales are very unlikely to meet\\\\nthat hurdle.\\\\n\\\\nQ4: How will an entity interpret \\\\u2018infrequent\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018insignificant\\\\u2019?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nIFRS 9 requires that if more than an infrequent number of sales is made out of a\\\\nportfolio and those sales are more than insignificant in value (either individually\\\\nor in aggregate), the entity needs to assess whether and how such sales are\\\\nconsistent with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, IFRS 9 does not explain how \\\\u2018infrequent\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018insignificant\\\\u2019 should be\\\\ninterpreted\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe transition guidance in paragraph 7.2.4 of IFRS 9 provides that an entity\\\\nshould assess the business model based on the facts and circumstances that\\\\nexist at the date of initial application, and that the resulting classification should\\\\nbe applied retrospectively. However, this transition relief is not extended to the\\\\nSPPI test.\\\\n\\\\n64 See paragraph IFRS 9.3.1.1.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAbout EY\\\\nEY is a global leader in assurance, tax, transaction and advisory services. \\\\nThe insights and quality services we deliver help build trust and confidence \\\\nin the capital markets and in economies the world over.

But, unless the underlying pool can only be acquired at origination,\\\\nit may be very difficult to \\\\u2018look through\\\\u2019 to the underlying pool to determine\\\\nif its prepayment features would themselves be solely payments of principal\\\\nand interest. This is because the information will often not be available to\\\\ndetermine whether the assets were acquired at a premium or discount and\\\\nwhether the fair value of any prepayment feature was insignificant on\\\\nacquisition (see 4.3.4).\\\\n\\\\n4.4.1 Assessing the characteristics of the underlying pool\\\\n\\\\nFor the purposes of criterion (b) in 4.4 above, the underlying pool may contain\\\\nfinancial assets or liabilities such as interest rate swaps. In order for these\\\\ninstruments not to preclude the use of amortised cost or FVOCI accounting for\\\\nholders of a tranche, they must reduce the variability of cash flows, or align the\\\\ncash flows of the tranches with the cash flows of the underlying pool of the\\\\nprimary instruments. If the underlying pool of financial instruments contained a\\\\npurchased credit default swap, this would not preclude the use of amortised\\\\ncost or FVOCI accounting provided it paid out only to compensate for the loss\\\\nof principal and interest, although, in practice, it is far more common for\\\\nunderlying pools to contain written rather than purchased credit default swaps.\\\\nAs a consequence, it may well be possible to obtain amortised cost or FVOCI\\\\naccounting treatment for the more senior investments in cash CDOs, i.e., those\\\\nfor which the underlying pool comprises the reference debt instruments.\\\\nHowever, senior tranches of synthetic CDOs, for which the risk exposure of the\\\\ntranches is generated by derivatives, would not pass the SPPI test.\\\\n\\\\n4.4.2 Assessing the exposure to credit risk in the tranche held25\\\\n\\\\nIFRS 9 does not prescribe a method for comparing the exposure to credit risk in\\\\nthe tranche held to that of the underlying pool of financial instruments.\\\\n\\\\n23 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.206.\\\\n24 See paragraph IFRS 9.BC4.206(a).\\\\n25 Refer to question Q46 in the Appendix to this publication.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 20\\\\n\\\\nFor the more senior and junior tranches, it may become obvious, after relatively\\\\nlittle analysis, whether the tranche is more or less risky than the underlying\\\\nassets. In some cases, it may be possible to compare the credit rating allocated\\\\nto the tranche with that for the underlying pool of financial instruments,\\\\nprovided they are all rated.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, in some circumstances involving complex securitisation structures, a\\\\nmore detailed assessment may be required. For example, it might be\\\\nappropriate to prepare an analysis that involves developing various credit loss\\\\nscenarios for the underlying pool of financial instruments, computing the\\\\nprobability-weighted outcomes of those scenarios, determining the\\\\nprobability-weighted effect on the tranche held, and comparing the relative\\\\nvariability of the tranche held with that of the underlying assets.\\\\n\\\\n5. Classifying financial liabilities26\\\\n\\\\nThe classification of financial liabilities under IFRS9 does not follow the\\\\napproach for the classification of financial assets, rather it remains broadly\\\\nthe same as under IAS 39. Except for financial guarantee contracts and loan\\\\ncommitments that are scoped out of the standard, financial liabilities are\\\\nmeasured either at FVTPL or at amortised cost.\\\\n\\\\nFinancial liabilities are measured at FVTPL when they meet the definition of held\\\\nfor trading or when they are designated as such on initial recognition using the\\\\nfair value option (see section 6)\\n, that results in a more than an infrequent number of sales), so\\\\nthat the business model would no longer qualify for amortised cost accounting,\\\\nthe question of how the entity should measure the existing assets and any\\\\nnewly acquired assets then arises.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nAlthough more than an infrequent number of sales have occurred, unless there\\\\nhas been a fundamental change in the entity\\\\u2019s business model, the requirements\\\\nof the standard regarding reclassification are unlikely to be triggered. Changes\\\\nin the business model for managing financial assets that trigger reclassification\\\\nof financial assets must be significant to the entity\\'s operations and\\\\ndemonstrable to external parties. They are expected to be very infrequent.\\\\n\\\\nAssuming that the assets are not reclassified, it is likely that the entity will have\\\\nto divide the portfolio into two sub-portfolios going forward \\\\u2014 one for the old\\\\nassets and one for any new assets acquired.\\\\n\\\\nFinancial assets previously recognised will remain at amortised cost. New\\\\nfinancial assets acquired will be measured at FVTPL or at FVOCI. Whether the\\\\nassets are measured at FVTPL or FVOCI depends on the new business model\\\\nand the characteristics of the assets.\\\\n\\\\nThe date for recording reclassifications\\\\n\\\\nQ54: An entity changes its business model during the year, and is required\\\\nto reclassify all affected financial assets. When is the reclassification\\\\nrecorded?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nA change in the entity\\\\u2019s business model must be accounted for prospectively\\\\nfrom the reclassification date, which is defined in the standard as \\\\u2018the first\\\\nday of the first reporting period following the change in business model\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, an entity with a reporting year-end of 31 December might\\\\ndetermine that there is a change in its business model in August.\\\\n\\\\nIf the entity prepares and publishes quarterly reports under IFRS, it should\\\\napply the old classification up to 30 September and, as of 1 October, reclassify\\\\nall affected financial assets and apply the new classification prospectively from\\\\nthat date. However, if the entity only prepares annual accounts, the entity is\\\\nrequired to reclassify all affected financial assets and apply the new\\\\nclassification as of 1 January of the following year.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 62\\\\n\\\\nChanges in a financial asset\\\\u2019s characteristics\\\\n\\\\nQ55: Is reclassification permitted or required when the characteristics of a\\\\nfinancial asset change, e.g., when the conversion option of a\\\\nconvertible bond lapses? Does the answer differ if the convertible\\\\nbond is converted into shares of the issuer?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nReclassifications are neither permitted nor required when the characteristics of\\\\na financial asset vary over the asset\\\\u2019s life based on its original contractual\\\\nterms. Unlike a change in the business model, the contractual terms of a\\\\nfinancial asset are known at initial recognition and an entity classifies the\\\\nfinancial asset at initial recognition based on the contractual terms over the life\\\\nof the instrument.62\\\\n\\\\nThus, no reclassification is permitted or required when, for instance, the\\\\nconversion option of a convertible bond lapses. If, however, a convertible bond\\\\nis converted into shares, the shares represent a new financial asset to be\\\\nrecognised by the entity. The entity would then need to determine the\\\\nclassification category for the new equity investment.\\\\n\\\\nEffective date and transition\\\\nThe standard\\\\u2019s date of initial application\\\\n\\\\nQ56: What is the date of initial application of IFRS 9?\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\n\\\\nIf IFRS 9 is adopted in 2016 or 2017, the date of initial application will be the\\\\nfirst day of the reporting period in which it is adopted. For an entity that\\\\npublishes quarterly financial statements that comply with IAS 34, we consider\\\\nreporting period to include interim periods and not only annual reporting\\\\nperiods. Hence, such an entity could designate the start of any quarterly period\\\\nas its date of initial application.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, for entities that do not adopt IFRS 9 early, the date of initial application\\\\nwill be the start of the annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2018\\n\"\\\\nApplying IFRS\\\\n\\\\nClassification of financial \\\\ninstruments under IFRS 9\\\\nMay 2015\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 May 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9\\\\n\\\\nContents\\\\n\\\\n1.

A business\\\\nmodel that results in measurement at FVTPL is where the financial assets are\\\\nheld for trading. Another is where the assets are managed on a fair value basis.\\\\nIn each case, the entity manages the financial assets with the objective of\\\\nrealising cash flows through the sale of the assets. The entity makes decisions\\\\nbased on the assets\\\\u2019 fair values and manages the assets to realise those fair\\\\nvalues. As consequence, the entity\\\\u2019s objective will typically result in active\\\\nbuying and selling.\\\\n\\\\nHow we see it\\\\nAs set out in IFRS 9, FVOCI is a defined category and is neither a residual nor\\\\nan election. However, in practice, entities may identify those debt\\\\ninstruments that are held to collect contractual cash flows, those that are\\\\nheld for trading, those managed on a fair value basis and those for which the\\\\nentity applies the fair value option to avoid a measurement mismatch, and\\\\nthen measure the remaining debt instruments at FVOCI. As a consequence,\\\\nthe FVOCI category might, in effect, be used as a residual, just because it is\\\\nfar easier to articulate business models that would be classified at amortised\\\\ncost or at FVTPL.\\\\n\\\\n4 Characteristics of the contractual cash flows\\\\nof the instrument\\\\n\\\\nThe assessment of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows aims to\\\\nidentify whether the contractual cash flows are \\\\u2018solely payments of principal and\\\\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding\\\\u2019. Hence, the assessment is\\\\ncolloquially referred to as the \\\\u2018SPPI test\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nThe SPPI test is designed to screen out financial assets on which the application\\\\nof the effective interest method (EIM) either is not viable from a pure\\\\nmechanical standpoint or does not provide useful information about the\\\\nuncertainty, timing and amount of the financial asset\\\\u2019s contractual cash flows.\\\\n\\\\nBecause the EIM is essentially an allocation mechanism that spreads interest\\\\nrevenue or expense over time, amortised cost or FVOCI measurement is only\\\\nappropriate for simple cash flows that have low variability such as those of \\\\u2018plain\\\\nvanilla\\\\u2019 loans and receivables and debt securities. Accordingly, the SPPI test is\\\\nbased on the premise that it is only when the variability in the contractual cash\\\\nflows arises to maintain the holder\\\\u2019s return in line with a \\\\u2018basic lending\\\\narrangement\\\\u2019 that the application of the EIM provides useful information.\\\\n\\\\n7 Refer to questions Q17-Q20 in the Appendix to this publication.\\\\n\\\\nThe IASB believes that\\\\namortised cost would\\\\nprovide relevant and\\\\nuseful information as long\\\\nas the contractual cash\\\\nflows do not introduce\\\\nrisks or volatility that are\\\\ninconsistent with a basic\\\\nlending arrangement.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay 2015 Applying IFRS \\\\u2013 Classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9 10\\\\n\\\\nIn this context, the term \\\\u2018basic lending arrangement\\\\u2019 is used broadly to capture\\\\nboth originated and acquired financial assets, the lender or the holder of which is\\\\nlooking to earn a return that compensates primarily for the time value of money\\\\nand credit risk. However, such an arrangement can also include other elements\\\\nthat provide consideration for other basic lending risks such as liquidity risks,\\\\ncosts associated with holding the financial asset for a period of time (e.g.,\\\\nservicing or administrative costs) and can also include a profit margin.\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimis exposure\\\\n(see section 4.3.1) to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that is\\\\nunrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity\\\\nprices or commodity prices, do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are\\\\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding\\n\\n',\n",
