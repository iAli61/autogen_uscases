      "The increasing complexity of technical data and concepts poses significant challenges when it comes to making information accessible to broader audiences. However, various research and informational campaigns have successfully demystified these complexities, presenting data in a form that engages and educates readers without a background in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "One landmark approach is the use of data visualization tools, a practice that has evolved considerably over recent years. For example, in a study titled \"Visualizing Complexity: Using Participatory Data Visualization to Foster Understanding,\" researchers discussed how participatory data visualization could engage communities in understanding complex data (Bresciani, 2018). By involving audiences in the creation process, these visual tools make the data more relatable and easier to understand.\n",

In \"Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals,\" Knaflic showcases how narrative combined with data helps convey technical insights more clearly (Knaflic, 2015). By constructing a story around data, the information becomes more memorable and impactful for the audience.\n",

      "Machine learning is another complex technical concept that greatly benefits from simplified explanations. In the study \"Demystifying Machine Learning for Better Public Understanding,\" authors explain how they distilled the principles of machine learning into comprehensible parts without losing the essence of the technology (Smith et al., 2020). By breaking down the topic into fundamental elements and providing examples, the researchers were able to make the subject matter more approachable.\n",

For instance, the project \"SimCityEDU: Pollution Challenge!\" used an interactive game to teach players about the impact of urban planning on the environment while integrating complex data on pollution and public health (Mislevy et al., 2014). Through gameplay, players learn by doing, which can be a powerful method for internalizing technical information.\n",

      "TXT: Profiling: The First Step Towards Optimal Machine Learning Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "In the realm of machine learning, optimal performance doesn't solely hinge on advanced algorithms or large datasets – it often boils down to a deceptively old-school process: profiling. Profiling refers to the analysis of code to determine which sections consume the most resources, whether it's processing time, memory, or data communications. By identifying common performance bottlenecks, profiling enables developers to target specific areas for optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "For machine learning applications, such bottlenecks might include inefficient data preprocessing, poorly optimized numerical computations, or suboptimal resource allocation during model training. These can cause significant slowdowns, particularly when scaling up to larger datasets or more complex neural network architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of profiling in enhancing machine learning performance. A survey by Sun et al. provides a comprehensive overview of optimization methods, which are essential for understanding where and how to optimize after profiling has identified potential issues. Additionally, the development of profiling tools specifically for machine learning workloads has become an area of focus. An example is the study \"Efficient Runtime Profiling for Black-box Machine Learning Services on Sensor Streams,\" where Becker et al. have demonstrated a black-box approach suitable for containerized machine learning applications, assembling multiple techniques to efficiently profile jobs without making assumptions about the underlying hardware or data streams (Becker et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "High-level optimization techniques, such as those described by Tavarageri et al. (2021), can exploit the multi-level cache hierarchy of CPUs, while low-level techniques deal with vectorizing code to run well on SIMD units of processors. This combination of high-level and low-level approaches ensures that machine learning code is not only efficient in its execution pattern but also precisely optimized for the hardware it runs on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, ongoing research indicates that profiling can lead to not just improvements in speed but also gains in AI safety and operational reliability. The study \"Learning Intermediate Representations using Graph Neural Networks for NUMA and Prefetchers Optimization\" by TehraniJamsaz et al. (2022) shows that a hybrid model using both static and dynamic profiling information can achieve significant performance improvements, which are crucial for ensuring the reliability of AI systems in real-world scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, profiling can reveal that certain sections of code are inefficient because they make repetitive calls to slow operations or because they access memory in patterns that create bottlenecks. For example, matrix multiplication is a common operation in machine learning that, if not properly optimized, can drastically reduce performance. Techniques that specifically optimize such operations can lead to noticeable speed-ups. In deep learning workloads, these improvements are linked not only to model training time but also to energy consumption and hardware utilization – factors that are increasingly important as machine learning applications grow in scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "To encapsulate, the integration of profiling into the machine learning development workflow serves as a critical measure towards optimal performance. It informs developers where they can make impactful changes, ensuring that the system is not only accurate but also efficiently uses resources. This balance of speed, accuracy, and resource management is the key to scalable, sustainable machine learning solutions.\n",

      "**Metrics Matter: How to Gauge GPU Utilization Effectively**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fast-paced domain of machine learning, the need for robust performance metrics is non-negotiable. Researchers and engineers alike depend on well-defined metrics to measure the efficiency of their GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) utilization in order to optimize outcomes of machine learning models. GPU utilization directly impacts the speed and effectiveness of training deep learning algorithms and the inference times of trained models. Therefore, understanding and employing correct utilization metrics is critical for boosting operational efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "One fundamental metric to monitor is **throughput**, which indicates how some workload is processed by the GPU over a period of time. Higher throughput can imply better GPU utilization, as it suggests that more data is being processed more swiftly. This concept has been demonstrated effectively in the domain of Function-as-a-Service for machine learning inference. Zhao, Jha, and Hong's work on GPU-accelerated services shows that proper allocation of GPU resources for machine learning inference can significantly reduce latency, thus enhancing throughput (2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key metric is the **average job completion time**. Salus, for example, is a system that enables fine-grained GPU sharing with primitives like fast job switching and memory sharing. This approach improved the average completion time of DL training jobs by 3.19 times and fuelled a 42 times increase in GPU utilization for deep learning inference applications, compared to not sharing the GPU at all (Peifeng Yu et al., 2019). This demonstrates how techniques aimed at optimizing GPU scheduling can have a profound influence on overall machine learning performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, it's important to consider **latency**, especially in a production environment where real-time inference is required. Spatial sharing of GPU for Autotuning DNN models, as reported by Dhakal, Cho, Kulkarni, Ramakrishnan, and Sharma, is notable for optimizing GPU utilization and, subsequently, reducing latency. By effectively multiplexing several DNNs on the same GPU resources, latency can be improved, and throughput is increased by a factor of 5 (2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also worth mentioning that a metric like **inference latency** is crucial for evaluating the practicability of deploying a tuned DNN model. As discovered in the same study, a model tuned with an appropriate amount of GPU resources achieves commendable inference latency across a broad range of GPU resource availability. This is a significant insight for applications requiring scalability and reliability in variable operating conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet another metric to take into account is the efficiency of **dynamic resource allocation techniques**. MISO, for instance, can predict the optimal GPU partition allocation for different jobs without significant overhead. The result was a decrease in average job completion time by 49% compared to an unpartitioned scheme (Baolin Li et al., 2022). As AI applications become more multifaceted, the ability to dynamically allocate resources effectively becomes ever more critical for maintaining high levels of GPU utilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these metrics, it's clear that understanding and improving GPU utilization shapes the bedrock of machine learning efficiency. The above studies and findings present compelling evidence that leveraging specific strategies like Salus' sharing primitives, spatial sharing, and dynamic resource allocation can deliver significant enhancements in performance metrics across a spectrum of machine learning operations.\n",

      "Ensuring AI Safety and Reliability Through Optimization\n",
      "\n",
      "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in our daily lives, their safety and reliability are paramount concerns, particularly in high-stakes environments like autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance. Optimization strategies play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety, by ensuring that these systems can handle real-world variability and uncertainties with grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key strategy in optimization for safety is the implementation of inherent diverse redundant safety mechanisms, especially in AI-based software elements (Pitale, Abbaspour, Upadhyay). For instance, in autonomous driving systems, AI algorithms are responsible for critical tasks like perception, decision-making, and emergency responses. Given the unpredictability of road conditions, it is vital that these AI models have the ability to generalize beyond their initial training data while avoiding overconfidence in their decisions. By promoting certainty reporting architectures and diverse training data sets, the AI systems can maintain performance without compromising safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adopting a comprehensive safety framework is another optimization strategy for AI systems. For example, Chai's AI safety principles—content safeguarding, stability and robustness, operational transparency, and traceability—demonstrate how multidimensional safety research can be integrated into AI platforms (Lu, Korshuk, Liu, Beauchamp). These frameworks help in mitigating potential risks and promoting responsible and ethical use of AI, which are vital for user safety and trust in AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, a taxonomy for AI system evaluation can help streamline safety assessments by providing harmonized terminology and identifying essential evaluation elements (Xia, Lu, Zhu, Xing). This taxonomy enables a clear mapping between the AI lifecycle, stakeholders, and required evaluations, ensuring a more accountable AI supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several other aspects of AI optimization are noteworthy, such as the use of NeuroSymbolic AI systems, which bring together statistical and symbolic AI methods. The CREST framework developed by Gaur and Sheth focuses on consistency, reliability, explainability, and safety, offering a structured approach that can enhance trust in AI systems. However, while creating trust through safety is necessary, it is not enough on its own. AI safety must also encompass socio-technical and emergent system properties, an understanding advocated by Dobbe through the insights from the field of system safety for software-based automation in safety-critical domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, optimizing AI for safety involves a multi-layered approach that includes technical design, risk management considering the human-AI interaction (Saberi), and the socio-technical landscape as a whole. Such an approach must be both inclusive and robust, taking into account the many facets of AI deployment in real-world scenarios.\n",

      "As artificial intelligence (AI) permeates more areas of our lives, safety and performance optimization are becoming paramount. Researchers are delving into pressing challenges in AI safety, questioning how these systems can operate safely in unpredictable environments and examining the legal and ethical ramifications of AI applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "A primary concern outlined in the paper 'Inherent Diverse Redundant Safety Mechanisms for AI-based Software Elements in Automotive Applications' is the reliance of AI systems on training data and their subsequent struggle in situations unaccounted for in their datasets (Pitale et al., 2024). This is especially critical in autonomous driving, where AI must make split-second decisions with potentially life-threatening consequences. The research highlights the need for AI models to generalize effectively and function efficiently in the face of these domain shifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the legal and ethical aspects, 'The Human Factor in AI Safety' by Morteza Saberi (2022) underscores the complications arising from human interaction with AI systems. As these systems assume roles in decision-making, risks such as ethical dilemmas, biased outcomes, and safety hazards surface. It's imperative to consider not only the algorithms' safety but also the end-users' decision-making archetypes to ensure comprehensive risk management. \n",
      "\n",
      "Legal and ethical considerations deeply impact AI performance optimization and safety measures. Dobbe (2022) articulates that AI safety cannot be achieved solely through technical solutions. A broader view that encompasses the technical, social, and institutional components within the system's operational environment is required. This indicates the need for a transdisciplinary approach involving diverse stakeholders to create AI systems that are inherently safe and aligned with societal values.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the pursuit of optimization, 'The Chai Platform's AI Safety Framework' demonstrates how AI safety can be operationalized (Lu et al., 2023). By implementing a framework of content safeguarding, stability and robustness, alongside operational transparency and traceability, Chai shows how AI can progress responsibly. The application of safety principles in real-world platforms like Chai reveals that ethical use and user safety are integral to optimization.\n",

      "TXT: Introduction: The Imperative of Profiling and Optimization in Machine Learning\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a world where traffic flows smoothly at all hours, with no congestion, no accidents, just a seamless commute from point A to point B. This is not a utopian dream but a realistic future made possible by optimizing machine learning models in autonomous vehicles. Every millisecond of processing improvement could mean the difference between collision and correction, risk and safety. This scenario accentuates the significance of code optimization in real-world machine learning applications. Profiling and optimization serve as the twin beacons of performance and safety in the universe of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially within the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, profiling is the diagnostic exploration of machine learning models, providing insights into performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies. It enables us to understand resource consumption and detect areas within the code that can be refined for speed, accuracy, and efficiency. Take the research by TehraniJamsaz et al. (2022), where an innovative approach using graph neural networks for profiling led to capturing 80% of the performance gains available from dynamic profiling but with only 30% of the programs, signifying a substantial reduction in cost and computational effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Optimizing these insights is like finding a new gear in a high-performance engine. Optimization strategies, spanning from system design to deployment, refine models to run on diverse platforms without compromising safety. For instance, the advent of AI-powered compiler techniques transformed deep learning code optimization, achieving speed-ups of up to 8.2X on CPUs, a feat that Tavarageri et al. (2021) realized through machine learning-assisted compiler techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs like GPT-3 demand high resources and speed for seamless interaction and prompt decision-making. Optimization ensures safety by reducing risks of malfunction and inefficiency, which is crucial in applications such as medical diagnosis, where precision is imperative. The work by Becker et al. (2022) on efficient runtime profiling for black-box machine learning services exemplifies modern strides in optimization. Using a confluence of techniques to adaptively adjust resources, their method captured the general runtime behavior of machine learning jobs swiftly and accurately, emphasizing the importance of responsive and adaptive optimization in real-time AI safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "As AI systems grow more complex and integral to our daily lives, the disciplines of profiling and optimization are not merely about performance—they embody the stewardship of trust and reliability in technology.\n",

      "In the world of machine learning (ML), code optimization is akin to a relentless quest for efficiency and speed—a task that has evolved considerably from the hand-tuned efforts of yesteryears to today’s breakthrough AI-driven methodologies. Historically, code optimization in ML was a craft mastered by specialists with an intricate understanding of both algorithm intricacies and hardware specifications. The early approaches required a granular level of control, often resulting in labor-intensive, manual tuning to achieve desired performance outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to the present, and the landscape has undergone a seismic shift. Notably, the emergence of refined software frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch marked a transitional period towards automated optimizations, abstracting the complexity of code efficiency from machine learning developers and enabling a broader range of individuals to contribute to the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, it is the advent of sophisticated learning-based methods that truly revolutionizes code optimization. A particularly influential work by Sun et al. (2019) delivers an exhaustive survey of various optimization techniques, accentuating their transformative impact on machine learning (Sun et al., 2019). Machine learning not only reshapes existing optimization methods but is also used to directly enhance compiler efficiency, as demonstrated by Tavarageri et al. (2021) who apply AI techniques to markedly speed up deep learning operations on central processing units (CPUs) by considerable margins (Tavarageri et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "Building on these advancements, recent research has seen the rise of groundbreaking technologies that make optimization processes more cost-effective without sacrificing performance. TehraniJamsaz et al. (2022) explore this promising domain, unveiling hybrid models that integrate static and dynamic data to reduce the overhead of performance profiling, bringing a new level of efficiency to optimization practices (TehraniJamsaz et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The current trajectory points towards a future where AI not only powers the development of machine learning models but also curates the environment they operate within. Ensuring the AI systems we deploy are both high-performing and cost-effective, machine learning code optimization stands as a bedrock of reliable and sustainable AI solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing upon the Linked Papers With Code (LPWC) knowledge graph (Färber & Lamprecht, 2023), which divulges rich insights from nearly 400,000 machine learning publications, we find a treasure trove of data illustrating the ceaseless march of progress in the field. This vast repository includes information on a myriad of optimization tasks, methods, and evaluations, highlighting the community's collective endeavor to refine machine learning’s operational backbone.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the convergence of machine learning and code optimization continues to unfold, researchers and practitioners alike forge new paths—paths lit by the dual lanterns of innovation and efficiency. This exciting journey reaffirms the transformative power of machine learning, not just as a scientific discipline, but as an essential tool for nurturing the potential of artificial intelligence.\n",

      "ECENTLY, machine learning has grown at a remarkable rate, attracting a great number of researchers and practitioners. It has become one of the most popular research directions and plays a significant role in many fields, such as machine translation, speech recognition, image recognition, recommendation system, etc. Optimization is one of the core components of machine learning. The essence of most machine learning algorithms is to build an optimization model and learn the parameters in the objective function from the given data. In the era of immense data, the effectiveness and efficiency of the numerical optimization algorithms dramatically influence the popularization and application of the machine learning models. In order to promote the development of machine learning, a series of effective optimization methods were put forward, which have improved the performance and efficiency of machine learning methods.\n",

      "\n",
      "As the representative of first-order optimization methods, the stochastic gradient descent method [1], [2], as well as its variants, has been widely used in recent years and is evolving at a high speed. However, many users pay little attention to the characteristics or application scope of these methods. They often adopt them as black box optimizers, which may limit the functionality of the optimization methods. In this paper, we comprehensively introduce the fundamental optimization methods. Particularly, we systematically explain their advantages and disadvantages, their application scope, and the characteristics of their parameters. We hope that the targeted introduction will help users to choose the first-order optimization methods more conveniently and make parameter adjustment more reasonable in the learning process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared with first-order optimization methods, high- order methods [3], [4], [5] converge at a faster speed in which the curvature information makes the search direction more effective. High-order optimizations attract widespread attention but face more challenges. The difficulty in high- order methods lies in the operation and storage of the inverse matrix of the Hessian matrix. To solve this problem, many variants based on Newton's method have been developed, most of which try to approximate the Hessian matrix through some techniques [6], [7]. In subsequent studies, the stochastic quasi- Newton method and its variants are introduced to extend high- order methods to large-scale data [8], [9], [10].\n",
      "\n",
      "Derivative-free optimization methods [11], [12] are mainly used in the case that the derivative of the objective function may not exist or be difficult to calculate. There are two main ideas in derivative-free optimization methods. One is adopting a heuristic search based on empirical rules, and the other is fitting the objective function with samples. Derivative- free optimization methods can also work in conjunction with gradient-based methods.\n",

      "very popular NNs, i.e., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [13] and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which play important roles in various fields of machine learning. CNNs are feedforward neural networks with convolution calculation. CNNs have been successfully used in many fields such as image processing [14], [15], video processing [16] and natural language processing (NLP) [17], [18]. RNNs are a kind of sequential model and very active in NLP [19], [20], [21], [22]. Besides, RNNs are also popular in the fields of image processing [23], [24] and video processing [25]. In the field of constrained optimization, RNNs can achieve excellent results [26], [27], [28], [29]. In these works, the parameters of weights in RNNs can be learned by analytical methods, and these methods can find the optimal solution according to the trajectory of the state solution. Stochastic gradient-based algorithms are widely used in deep neural networks [30], [31], [32], [33]. However, various problems are emerging when employing stochastic gradient-based algorithms. For example, the learning rate will be oscillating in the later training stage of some adaptive methods [34], [35], which may lead to the problem of non-converging. Thus, further optimization algorithms based on variance reduction were proposed to improve the convergence rate [36], [37]. Moreover, combining the stochastic gradient descent and the characteristics of its variants is a possible direction to improve the optimization. Especially, switching an adaptive algorithm to the stochastic gradient descent method can improve the accuracy and convergence speed of the algorithm [38].\n",

      "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning, for which an agent interacts with the environment by trial-and-error mechanism and learns an optimal policy by maximizing cumulative rewards [39]. Deep reinforcement learning combines the RL and deep learning techniques, and enables the RL agent to have a good perception of its environment. Recent research has shown that deep learning can be applied to learn a useful representation for reinforcement learning problems [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. Stochastic optimization algorithms are commonly used in RL and deep RL models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meta learning [45], [46] has recently become very popular in the field of machine learning. The goal of meta learning is to design a model that can efficiently adapt to the new environment with as few samples as possible. The application of meta learning in supervised learning can solve the few-shot learning problems [47]. In general, meta learning methods can be summarized into the following three types [48]: metric- based methods [49], [50], [51], [52], model-based methods [53], [54] and optimization-based methods [55], [56], [47]. We will describe the details of optimization-based meta learning methods in the subsequent sections.\n",

      "Variational inference is a useful approximation method which aims to approximate the posterior distributions in Bayesian machine learning. It can be considered as an optimization problem. For example, mean-field variational inference uses coordinate ascent to solve this optimization problem [57]. As the amount of data increases continuously, it is not friendly to use the traditional optimization method to handle the variational inference. Thus, the stochastic\n",

      "variational inference was proposed, which introduced natural gradients and extended the variational inference to large-scale data [58].\n",
      "\n",
      "Optimization methods have a significative influence on various fields of machine learning. For example, [5] proposed the transformer network using Adam optimization [33], which is applied to machine translation tasks. [59] proposed super- resolution generative adversarial network for image super resolution, which is also optimized by Adam. [60] proposed Actor-Critic using trust region optimization to solve the deep reinforcement learning on Atari games as well as the MuJoCo environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stochastic optimization method can also be applied to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to improve efficiency. In this kind of application, stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a representative method [61] where the stochastic gradient accelerates the step of gradient update when handling large-scale samples. The noise introduced by the stochastic gradient can be characterized by introducing Gaussian noise and friction terms. Additionally, the deviation caused by HMC discretization can be eliminated by the friction term, and thus the Metropolis-Hasting step can be omitted. The hyper-parameter settings in the HMC will affect the performance of the model. There are some efficient ways to automatically adjust the hyperparameters and improve the performance of the sampler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The development of optimization brings a lot of contri- butions to the progress of machine learning. However, there are still many challenges and open problems for optimization problems in machine learning. 1) How to improve optimization performance with insufficient data in deep neural networks is a tricky problem. If there are not enough samples in the training of deep neural networks, it is prone to cause the problem of high variances and overfitting [62]. In addition, non-convex optimization has been one of the difficulties in deep neural networks, which makes the optimization tend to get a locally optimal solution rather than the global optimal solution. 2) For sequential models, the samples are often truncated by batches when the sequence is too long, which will cause deviation. How to analyze the deviation of stochastic optimization in this case and correct it is vital. 3) The stochastic variational inference is graceful and practical, and it is probably a good choice to develop methods of applying high-order gradient information to stochastic variational inference. 4) It may be a great idea to introduce the stochastic technique to the conjugate gradient method to obtain an elegant and powerful optimization algorithm. The detailed techniques to make improvements in the stochastic conjugate gradient is an interesting and challenging problem.\n",

      "The purpose of this paper is to summarize and analyze classical and modern optimization methods from a machine learning perspective. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes the machine learning problems from the perspective of optimization. Section III discusses the classical optimization algorithms and their latest developments in machine learning. Particularly, the recent popular optimization methods including the first and second order optimization algorithms are emphatically introduced.\n",

      "ECENTLY, machine learning has grown at a remarkable rate, attracting a great number of researchers and practitioners. It has become one of the most popular research directions and plays a significant role in many fields, such as machine translation, speech recognition, image recognition, recommendation system, etc. Optimization is one of the core components of machine learning. The essence of most machine learning algorithms is to build an optimization model and learn the parameters in the objective function from the given data. In the era of immense data, the effectiveness and efficiency of the numerical optimization algorithms dramatically influence the popularization and application of the machine learning models. In order to promote the development of machine learning, a series of effective optimization methods were put forward, which have improved the performance and efficiency of machine learning methods.\n",

      "As the representative of first-order optimization methods, the stochastic gradient descent method [1], [2], as well as its variants, has been widely used in recent years and is evolving at a high speed. However, many users pay little attention to the characteristics or application scope of these methods. They often adopt them as black box optimizers, which may limit the functionality of the optimization methods. In this paper, we comprehensively introduce the fundamental optimization methods. Particularly, we systematically explain their advantages and disadvantages, their application scope, and the characteristics of their parameters. We hope that the targeted introduction will help users to choose the first-order optimization methods more conveniently and make parameter adjustment more reasonable in the learning process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared with first-order optimization methods, high- order methods [3], [4], [5] converge at a faster speed in which the curvature information makes the search direction more effective. High-order optimizations attract widespread attention but face more challenges. The difficulty in high- order methods lies in the operation and storage of the inverse matrix of the Hessian matrix. To solve this problem, many variants based on Newton's method have been developed, most of which try to approximate the Hessian matrix through some techniques [6], [7]. In subsequent studies, the stochastic quasi- Newton method and its variants are introduced to extend high- order methods to large-scale data [8], [9], [10].\n",
      "\n",
      "Derivative-free optimization methods [11], [12] are mainly used in the case that the derivative of the objective function may not exist or be difficult to calculate. There are two main ideas in derivative-free optimization methods. One is adopting a heuristic search based on empirical rules, and the other is fitting the objective function with samples. Derivative- free optimization methods can also work in conjunction with gradient-based methods.\n",

      "very popular NNs, i.e., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [13] and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which play important roles in various fields of machine learning. CNNs are feedforward neural networks with convolution calculation. CNNs have been successfully used in many fields such as image processing [14], [15], video processing [16] and natural language processing (NLP) [17], [18]. RNNs are a kind of sequential model and very active in NLP [19], [20], [21], [22]. Besides, RNNs are also popular in the fields of image processing [23], [24] and video processing [25]. In the field of constrained optimization, RNNs can achieve excellent results [26], [27], [28], [29]. In these works, the parameters of weights in RNNs can be learned by analytical methods, and these methods can find the optimal solution according to the trajectory of the state solution. Stochastic gradient-based algorithms are widely used in deep neural networks [30], [31], [32], [33]. However, various problems are emerging when employing stochastic gradient-based algorithms. For example, the learning rate will be oscillating in the later training stage of some adaptive methods [34], [35], which may lead to the problem of non-converging. Thus, further optimization algorithms based on variance reduction were proposed to improve the convergence rate [36], [37]. Moreover, combining the stochastic gradient descent and the characteristics of its variants is a possible direction to improve the optimization. Especially, switching an adaptive algorithm to the stochastic gradient descent method can improve the accuracy and convergence speed of the algorithm [38].\n",

      "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning, for which an agent interacts with the environment by trial-and-error mechanism and learns an optimal policy by maximizing cumulative rewards [39]. Deep reinforcement learning combines the RL and deep learning techniques, and enables the RL agent to have a good perception of its environment. Recent research has shown that deep learning can be applied to learn a useful representation for reinforcement learning problems [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. Stochastic optimization algorithms are commonly used in RL and deep RL models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meta learning [45], [46] has recently become very popular in the field of machine learning. The goal of meta learning is to design a model that can efficiently adapt to the new environment with as few samples as possible. The application of meta learning in supervised learning can solve the few-shot learning problems [47]. In general, meta learning methods can be summarized into the following three types [48]: metric- based methods [49], [50], [51], [52], model-based methods [53], [54] and optimization-based methods [55], [56], [47]. We will describe the details of optimization-based meta learning methods in the subsequent sections.\n",

      "Variational inference is a useful approximation method which aims to approximate the posterior distributions in Bayesian machine learning. It can be considered as an optimization problem. For example, mean-field variational inference uses coordinate ascent to solve this optimization problem [57]. As the amount of data increases continuously, it is not friendly to use the traditional optimization method to handle the variational inference. Thus, the stochastic\n",

      "Optimization methods have a significative influence on various fields of machine learning. For example, [5] proposed the transformer network using Adam optimization [33], which is applied to machine translation tasks. [59] proposed super- resolution generative adversarial network for image super resolution, which is also optimized by Adam. [60] proposed Actor-Critic using trust region optimization to solve the deep reinforcement learning on Atari games as well as the MuJoCo environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stochastic optimization method can also be applied to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to improve efficiency. In this kind of application, stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a representative method [61] where the stochastic gradient accelerates the step of gradient update when handling large-scale samples. The noise introduced by the stochastic gradient can be characterized by introducing Gaussian noise and friction terms. Additionally, the deviation caused by HMC discretization can be eliminated by the friction term, and thus the Metropolis-Hasting step can be omitted. The hyper-parameter settings in the HMC will affect the performance of the model. There are some efficient ways to automatically adjust the hyperparameters and improve the performance of the sampler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The development of optimization brings a lot of contri- butions to the progress of machine learning. However, there are still many challenges and open problems for optimization problems in machine learning. 1) How to improve optimization performance with insufficient data in deep neural networks is a tricky problem. If there are not enough samples in the training of deep neural networks, it is prone to cause the problem of high variances and overfitting [62]. In addition, non-convex optimization has been one of the difficulties in deep neural networks, which makes the optimization tend to get a locally optimal solution rather than the global optimal solution. 2) For sequential models, the samples are often truncated by batches when the sequence is too long, which will cause deviation. How to analyze the deviation of stochastic optimization in this case and correct it is vital. 3) The stochastic variational inference is graceful and practical, and it is probably a good choice to develop methods of applying high-order gradient information to stochastic variational inference. 4) It may be a great idea to introduce the stochastic technique to the conjugate gradient method to obtain an elegant and powerful optimization algorithm. The detailed techniques to make improvements in the stochastic conjugate gradient is an interesting and challenging problem.\n",

Section II summarizes the machine learning problems from the perspective of optimization. Section III discusses the classical optimization algorithms and their latest developments in machine learning. Particularly, the recent popular optimization methods including the first and second order optimization algorithms are emphatically introduced.\n",

      "Abstract-In highly distributed environments such as cloud, edge and fog computing, the application of machine learning for automating and optimizing processes is on the rise. Machine learning jobs are frequently applied in streaming conditions, where models are used to analyze data streams originating from e.g. video streams or sensory data. Often the results for particular data samples need to be provided in time before the arrival of next data. Thus, enough resources must be provided to ensure the just-in-time processing for the specific data stream. This paper focuses on proposing a runtime modeling strategy for containerized machine learning jobs, which enables the optimization and adaptive adjustment of resources per job and component. Our black-box approach assembles multiple tech- niques into an efficient runtime profiling method, while making no assumptions about underlying hardware, data streams, or applied machine learning jobs. The results show that our method is able to capture the general runtime behaviour of different machine learning jobs already after a short profiling phase.\n",

Especially in the aforementioned domains, different types of sensors are employed to collect data in order to represent real-world phenomena, enable technologies such as digital twins and improve the environmental awareness. Moreover, the combination and analysis of sensor streams allows for new usage scenarios and business models, providing e.g. pre- dictive maintenance services, healthcare monitoring or remote machine orchestration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the advances in data analysis through i.e. sophisti- cated deep-learning models and the increase in data acquisi- tion, the locality of data processing tasks is also shifted closer to the actual sources: Upcoming technologies such as edge and fog computing enable the execution of machine learning (ML) models on small and lightweight devices, which can be located across e.g. a smart city. Consequently, the amount of heterogeneous devices in terms of hardware components (i.e. different CPU architectures, CPU cores, memory or available accelerators such as GPUs) in the edge cloud continuum is growing rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although lightweight virtualization technologies such as containerization, in combination with orchestration frame- works like Kubernetes, simplified the deployment of analy-\n",
      "\n",
      "sis tasks in these environments, considerable challenges still remain. One of the main benefits of analyzing the (sensor) data streams as close as possible to the data source, is the accelerated response time for situations indicated in the data. In order to act as soon as possible on e.g. outliers detected in the data stream, enough resources for the ML jobs need to be provided to ensure a just-in-time computation of the ingested data. Consequently, this results in strict requirements for hardware resources to permit the analysis of a sample in the data stream before the next sample arrives. Especially in settings of high-frequent data streams, the bounds get increasingly important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, a runtime model of the applied stream-based ML jobs under different resource limitations is needed to determine the required resources for just-in-time computation with given sample frequencies in the data stream. Runtime prediction in the context of cloud environments and big data is often based on historical data of job executions and involves do- main knowledge about the data and applied algorithms, static runtime targets and employed hardware [1], [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the heterogeneous nature of the previously mentioned highly distributed environments, a global runtime model of a job might not be fitting for each available device type in the infrastructure. In addition, new sensors can be connected in an ad-hoc manner to available devices, yielding further data streams and resulting in stream-based analytic jobs for which historical data is not yet available. Finally, the sample frequency in the data stream can vary over time or configuration which motivates an efficient approach to model the runtime behaviour of jobs directly on the respective and possibly lightweight devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we aim to investigate the problem of runtime profiling and prediction for black-box streaming ML jobs. In this paper, we propose a profiling approach which is executed on the respective devices each time a new job is started. Fur- thermore, we present several selection strategies for profiling points and introduce the concept of synthetic runtime targets. The generated model can be used for the adaptive adjustment of resources to set the highest restriction of resources, while still meeting runtime targets of the incoming data.\n",

      "## II. APPROACH\n",
      "\n",
      "This section presents our solution to obtaining a general runtime model for black-box machine learning services. To this end, as depicted in Figure 1, we propose an approach that combines both parallel and iterative profiling runs to- gether with an iterative replacement strategy for the employed runtime model, such that for any number of investigated resource configurations, a more suitable function is fitted. Finally, the resulting model can be used to dynamically adjust the resources of analysis jobs using i.e. Kubernetes, in order to enable a just-in-time processing of incoming data samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "## A. Runtime Model\n",
      "\n",
      "Since profiling of applications induces additional costs, we seek a lightweight solution for both profiling and modeling. In [3], the authors propose an approximation function for modeling the computation time with respect to limited re- sources R. As shown in [4], it is reasonable for certain stream- based ML jobs to focus on CPU only, as memory overhead is oftentimes constant. We design an adapted version of this function compute(.) and define it as:\n",
      "\n",
      "compute(R) = a · (R . d)-b+c (1)\n",
      "\n",
      "This equation includes four parameters to be optimized, namely a, b, c, and d. Previous works [3]-[5] found that learning these four parameters from a profiling phase can provide high quality profiling approximations for stream-based machine learning jobs. Due to the four parameters, fitting a curve is just possible with at least five points from a profiling phase. However, it remains unclear how to best proceed when no data points are available yet, and how to select valuable next data points based on a handful of already known. We deliver an answer to the question of limited data points by proposing an iterative replacement strategy for the employed function to fit. Formally, let |R| denote the number of data points, we employ a function to fit as:\n",

      "|a · R-b + c,|if | R| = 4|\n",
      "|a . (R . d) -b + c,|else|\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "f(R) =\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, we choose our fitting function dependent on the number of available data points. We thus incrementally improve our prediction capabilities with each newly profiled data point until Equation 1 can be employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "## B. Selection Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given an envisioned target runtime, our approach to runtime modeling can be used to predict the next CPU limitation to investigate which most likely better matches the runtime target. Over time, with an increasing number of data points and also more sophisticated fitting functions usable, the runtime behavior of a black-box machine learning service with respect to its CPU limitations can be sufficiently approximated. Yet, this procedure is vulnerable in two aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "· The learned runtime behavior is highly dependent on the concrete runtime target, which means that a fitted function does not necessarily generalize well, i.e. its interpolation and extrapolation capabilities are potentially limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "· As the runtime increases exponentially for small limita- tions imposed on the CPU, a disadvantageous selection strategy can significantly prolong the profiling phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure that the exponential relationship between CPU limitations and runtimes is appropriately captured, we intro- duce the idea of synthetic targets, i.e. we target the runtime corresponding to a CPU limitation that is just small enough to guarantee an inspection of most of the exponential curve by our runtime modeling approach. By profiling this small CPU limitation and using the observed runtime as runtime target, all subsequent CPU limitations will be selected accordingly. Moreover, since the profiling of especially small CPU lim- itations takes a comparably long time while only utilizing a fraction of the overall available resources, we initially conduct multiple profiling runs in parallel and ensure that the range of CPU limitations to investigate is appropriately covered. This effectively reduces the overall profiling time and makes use of the available resources efficiently. Formally, given a set of pos- sible CPU limitations L = {/min, /min + 8, ... , lmax - 8, max } with lower bound (min, upper bound (max, and logical step size 8, we aim at running n initial profiling runs in parallel such that the selected CPU limitations Rinitial are unique, sum up to at most (max, and sufficiently represent the range of possible CPU limitations while minimizing the profiling time:\n",

The time is reported by the model itself for each single computed sample. The main task is therefore to determine when enough samples have been reviewed to be confident in the computation time per sample, in order to stop the profiling of the given resource limitation.\n",

      "Creating high performance implementations of deep learn- ing primitives on CPUs is a challenging task. Multiple con- siderations including multi-level cache hierarchy, and wide SIMD units of CPU platforms influence the choice of pro- gram transformations to apply for performance optimization. In this paper, we present machine learning powered compiler techniques to optimize loop nests. We take a two-pronged approach to code optimization: We first apply high level op- timizations to optimize the code to take optimal advantage of the cache memories. Then, we perform low level, target- specific optimizations to effectively vectorize the code to run well on the SIMD units of the machine. For high level opti- mizations, we use polyhedral compilation techniques and deep learning approaches. For low level optimization, we use a target specific code generator that generates code using vec- tor intrinsics and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to find the optimal parameters for the code generator. We per- form experimental evaluation of the developed techniques on various matrix multiplications that occur in popular deep learning workloads. The experimental results show that the compiler techniques presented in the paper achieve 7.6X and 8.2X speed-ups over a baseline for sequential and parallel runs respectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "Deep learning (DL) has become pervasive in various domains of computing. Image recognition [14, 17], language model- ing [10], language translation [31], speech recognition [15] make extensive use of deep neural networks (DNNs). Deep Learning inference is an important workload across appli- cations, such as object classification & recognition, text and speech translation etc. A 2018 Mc Kinsey study [5] pointed out that in datacenters, 75% of the inference tasks are run on CPUs. Optimizing DL workloads on CPUs is a challenging proposition because of architectural complexities of CPU\n",

      "platforms. Multi-level cache hierarchies, TLBs (Translation Look-aside Buffers), hardware data prefetchers, SIMD (a.k.a vector) units present particular challenges in writing high performance code. Therefore, the current state-of-practice is to use expert-coded high performance libraries such as Intel oneDNN [3] in deep learning frameworks such as Tensor- Flow and PyTorch to achieve good performance. However, being reliant on libraries for performance is not scalable. First, it would increase the time-to-market: from the time a new DL operator is invented to its being supported in a library could take a considerable amount of time. Second, even expert programmers must invest significant amount of effort to tune the implementations on the target platforms. Therefore, an attractive alternative solution is to develop compilation techniques that automate code optimization and achieve similar performance levels as expert-coded libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to auto- matic code optimization. We categorize the program opti- mizations into two phases: high level and low level optimiza- tions. High level optimizations perform loop optimizations such as loop reordering and tiling to derive a loop struc- ture that utilizes the cache hierarchy of the computer sys- tem to the fullest extent possible. Low level optimizations generate vector code using the target machine's intrinsics; reinforcement learning methodology guides the derivation of high performance vector code. For high-level and low- level optimizations we leverage artificial intelligence (A.I.) techniques. We evaluate our automated compiler system on GEMMs which lie at the heart of deep learning [1]. The re- sults indicate our compiler workflow delivers competitive performance compared to Intel oneDNN library and signif- icantly higher performance compared to a state-of-the-art DL compiler, viz., AutoTVM [9].\n",

The low-level optimizations involv- ing the target platform specific code generator and reinforce- ment learning are developed in Section 4.

      "We first describe the overall compiler workflow. We input the loop nests such as GEMMs to the compiler. The high level optimizer first optimizes the loop structure and then passes on the code to the low level optimer. Figure 1 shows the workflow of the optimization process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The high level optimizer uses polyhedral compilation tech- niques for optimization of the loop structure to take advan- tage of the multi-level caches of the CPU platform. The loop reordering and tiling transformations are applied and the best loop order and tile sizes are determined by the high level optimizer. It will enhance data locality - both the spa- tial and temporal locality such that the data used by the input program is reused out of the caches closest to the pro- cessor as much as possible. Section 3 details the polyhedral compilation techniques we apply for loop optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The high level optimer then hands over the optimized code to the low-level optimizer. The low level optimizer derives a vectorization strategy for effective use of the SIMD vector units. We employ a target specific low level optimization approach wherein the inner loops of the loop nest are vec- torized using the target-specific vector intrinsics. Further, we use a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to select the best vectorization plan among the myriad choices available.\n",

      "Abstract-This paper explores the role and challenges of Artifi- cial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, specifically AI-based software elements, in autonomous driving systems. These AI systems are fundamental in executing real-time critical functions in complex and high-dimensional environments. They handle vital tasks like multi-modal perception, cognition, and decision- making tasks such as motion planning, lane keeping, and emergency braking. A primary concern relates to the ability (and necessity) of AI models to generalize beyond their initial training data. This generalization issue becomes evident in real-time scenarios, where models frequently encounter inputs not represented in their training or validation data. In such cases, AI systems must still function effectively despite facing distributional or domain shifts. This paper investigates the risk associated with overconfident AI models in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. To mitigate these risks, methods for training AI models that help maintain perfor- mance without overconfidence are proposed. This involves implementing certainty reporting architectures and ensuring diverse training data. While various distribution-based meth- ods exist to provide safety mechanisms for AI models, there is a noted lack of systematic assessment of these methods, especially in the context of safety-critical automotive applications. Many methods in the literature do not adapt well to the quick response times required in safety-critical edge applications. This paper reviews these methods, discusses their suitability for safety-critical applications, and highlights their strengths and limitations. The paper also proposes potential improvements to enhance the safety and reliability of AI algorithms in autonomous vehicles in the context of rapid and accurate decision-making processes.\n",

      "In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, the is- sue of model overconfidence has emerged as a pressing con- cern and has attracted the attention of researchers, develop- ers, and the wider public. This paper delves into the problem of AI models displaying overconfidence, a phenomenon with significant implications for safety and reliability. Overly confident AI models often make predictions with unjus- tified certainty, frequently failing to acknowledge the in-\n",
      "\n",
      "herent uncertainty in complex real-world scenarios [1]. For example, overconfident perception models in autonomous driving applications may inaccurately classify objects on the road, erroneously projecting unwarranted certainty in object detection and the ensuing action [2]. Likewise, overconfident path prediction models can make incorrect assumptions about the actions of other vehicles, potentially resulting in or creating hazardous interactions [3]. Furthermore, overconfi- dent path planning algorithms might underestimate the risks associated with specific maneuvers, endangering not only the ego vehicle and its occupants but also the surrounding traffic environment [4]. These overconfident behaviors can lead to severe consequences, particularly in domains where AI systems hold responsibility for critical decision-making.

      "Abstract-This paper explores the role and challenges of Artifi- cial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, specifically AI-based software elements, in autonomous driving systems. These AI systems are fundamental in executing real-time critical functions in complex and high-dimensional environments. They handle vital tasks like multi-modal perception, cognition, and decision- making tasks such as motion planning, lane keeping, and emergency braking. A primary concern relates to the ability (and necessity) of AI models to generalize beyond their initial training data. This generalization issue becomes evident in real-time scenarios, where models frequently encounter inputs not represented in their training or validation data. In such cases, AI systems must still function effectively despite facing distributional or domain shifts. This paper investigates the risk associated with overconfident AI models in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. To mitigate these risks, methods for training AI models that help maintain perfor- mance without overconfidence are proposed. This involves implementing certainty reporting architectures and ensuring diverse training data. While various distribution-based meth- ods exist to provide safety mechanisms for AI models, there is a noted lack of systematic assessment of these methods, especially in the context of safety-critical automotive applications. Many methods in the literature do not adapt well to the quick response times required in safety-critical edge applications. This paper reviews these methods, discusses their suitability for safety-critical applications, and highlights their strengths and limitations. The paper also proposes potential improvements to enhance the safety and reliability of AI algorithms in autonomous vehicles in the context of rapid and accurate decision-making processes.\n",

      "In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, the is- sue of model overconfidence has emerged as a pressing con- cern and has attracted the attention of researchers, develop- ers, and the wider public.

      "herent uncertainty in complex real-world scenarios [1]. For example, overconfident perception models in autonomous driving applications may inaccurately classify objects on the road, erroneously projecting unwarranted certainty in object detection and the ensuing action [2]. Likewise, overconfident path prediction models can make incorrect assumptions about the actions of other vehicles, potentially resulting in or creating hazardous interactions [3]. Furthermore, overconfi- dent path planning algorithms might underestimate the risks associated with specific maneuvers, endangering not only the ego vehicle and its occupants but also the surrounding traffic environment [4]. These overconfident behaviors can lead to severe consequences, particularly in domains where AI systems hold responsibility for critical decision-making. To address these potential risks, this paper aims to investi- gate the root causes of overconfidence in AI models, analyze potential consequences, and, significantly, chart a course toward innovative solutions that can enhance the safety and dependability of AI systems. In doing so, we will examine existing mitigation techniques while also advocating for a proactive approach that encourages interdisciplinary collab- oration between fields of AI, system safety, and reliability to address this emerging challenge in the field of artificial intel- ligence.

      "While extending the generalization capabilities of AI models remains a topic of research pursuit, one of the persistent challenges that researchers and practitioners face is dealing with overconfident AI models. Overconfident models sig- nificantly impact the reliability and trustworthiness of AI- generated outputs and of any downstream functions reliant on these outputs. For this paper, we define an overconfident model as one that produces predictions with high certainty, even in situations where the inherent uncertainty is substan- tial. In other words, an overconfident model overestimates its own accuracy and reliability, especially when generalizing. One can easily derive a representation of an overconfident model as follows. Consider a population of size P + N with P = total number of positive examples and N = total number of negative examples. Then, for an overconfident model, we can say:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1)\n",
      "\n",
      "P+N TP + FP > P P+N\n",
      "\n",
      "where TP, FP are the models True and False Positive pre- dictions, respectively. Specifically, an overconfident model satisfies these two conditions: (TP + FP) > P and TP < P. Another simplistic naive model for an overconfi- dent predictor may be written as:\n",
      "\n",
      "Model Confidence = 1 + (Modelacc - Trueacc) (Modelacc + Trueacc) (2) i\n",
      "\n",
      "where acc = accuracy. This simple definition shows that for Modelace > Trueacc we get a confidence score > 1 . Overconfident models lead to potentially erroneous deci- sions and, hence, detrimental consequences in critical ap- plications. This phenomenon has raised serious concerns within the AI community, prompting researchers to delve into the intricacies of this problem. The impact of overconfident AI models can be far-reaching, affecting decision-making processes across various domains,\n",
      "\n",
      "particularly autonomous systems. In autonomous driving, for instance, overconfident AI diagnostic models might exhibit unwarranted certainty in their path predictions, potentially leading to incorrect path planning and leading the vehicle to another vehicle path and causing an accident. The fatal incidents involving autonomous vehicles in Arizona [8] and Florida [9] highlight a critical issue in AI-operated systems: overconfidence in decision-making models. This overconfi- dence is evident when these systems, trained and validated on limited scenarios, encounter real-world complexities that deviate from their training data, leading to miscalculations or complete oversights. In the Arizona incident involving an Uber autonomous vehi- cle, the system's predictive model exhibited overconfidence in its ability to discern and react to complex scenarios [8]. The perception model failed to identify the pedestrian accurately and did not engage in timely corrective action, suggesting a disconnection between the AI's predictive certainty and the objective ambiguity of real-world data. This overconfidence, rooted in the incongruence between the training data and the nuanced variables of live envi- ronments, highlights the susceptibility of AI systems to overlook or misinterpret unforeseen inputs, thereby leading to catastrophic outcomes. Similarly, the Tesla accident in Florida manifests another dimension of overconfidence in AI models. The vehicle's autonomous system was not equipped to recognize the white semi-trailer against a bright sky, a phenomenon indicative of perceptual aliasing. Despite this, the system did not significantly lower its confidence or engage precautionary measures, continuing instead under the presumption of precise navigation [9]. This incident accentuates that overconfident AI may not only misinterpret data but might also entirely miss critical information, all while maintaining a high confidence level in its flawed perception and the ensuing decision-making processes. The causal cascade of prediction/sensing error on down- stream actions (decisions) is well studied in Control theory. In non-AI systems, errors are typically propagated as sensor errors. In AI systems, the sensing equivalent is the model prediction error. Thus, given a decision or action A\n",

Critically, argue that the overconfident model will \"fail silently\" and will not provide adequate warning to the decision system to counter the accruing error (debt). This false sense of security from overconfident AI models can lead to hazardous driving\n",

      "Abstract-There is a large space of NUMA and hardware prefetcher configurations that can significantly impact the per- formance of an application. Previous studies have demonstrated how a model can automatically select configurations based on the dynamic properties of the code to achieve speedups. This paper demonstrates how the static Intermediate Representation (IR) of the code can guide NUMA/prefetcher optimizations without the prohibitive cost of performance profiling. We propose a method to create a comprehensive dataset that includes a diverse set of intermediate representations along with optimum configurations. We then apply a graph neural network model in order to validate this dataset. We show that our static intermediate representation based model achieves 80% of the performance gains provided by expensive dynamic performance profiling based strategies. We further develop a hybrid model that uses both static and dynamic information. Our hybrid model achieves the same gains as the dynamic models but at a reduced cost by only profiling 30% of the programs.\n",

      "Thread-level parallelism increases data demand to the main centralized memory. Complex memory hierarchies, caches, and prefetching methods that identify access patterns and fetch the data ahead of time try to solve this but have not scaled with the data demand, thus limiting the performance gains. To continuously sustain memory scaling, multi-core systems were forced to adopt the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) memory design. NUMA systems provide a separate memory for each processor, thereby increasing overall bandwidth and reducing congestion through the centralized memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resulting complex hardware exposes a large parameter space that must be explored for efficient application execution. Many tuning strategies and heuristics have been implemented to explore NUMA threads [1]-[3] and pages [4]-[6], as well as prefetching [7]-[9]. A common method is to build models on performance counters [10]-[12]. While executing the programs, performance metrics, that describe the execution behavior, are collected to guide the choice of the optimization online [6], [13] or offline [14], [15]. For instance, if we observe many remote accesses from a single node, it can be efficient to scatter the pages to the rest of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Models either rely on expert knowledge or on automatic machine learning approaches [16], [17]. Analytical models are understood by researchers but are difficult to adapt to the constant ongoing evolution of software and hardware. As a result more and more Machine Learning (ML) models are emerging [11]. There is a trade-off between the overhead and the complexity of the ML model and the output prediction accuracy. More advanced techniques such as deep learning can produce better predictions but require significantly more data. As a result, deep learning frameworks are not currently applied to guide NUMA/prefetching due to both the search size and the prohibitive cost of performance profiling [12].\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, collecting performance counters is very time con- suming, preventing the collection of thousands of samples re- quired for deep learning. Even worse, some hardware systems have custom performance counters. In other words, models targeting one system are not portable to another system as they have different sets of performance counters.\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper proposes a novel code characterization method that avoids the prohibitive cost of dynamically profiling ap- plications while providing valuable information that can be used to guide the optimization of programs with deep learning strategies. Our method statically collects data and thus enables the usage of advanced deep learning strategies to deliver com- petitive results. Moreover, our approach automatically identi- fies cases where only using static information is sufficient for optimization, and thus only collects dynamic information if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We start by compiling applications with different flag se- quences. Disparate compiler optimizations expose different properties of the code. For instance, the dead code elimination compiler pass removes useless blocks in the application. If a code has large blocks of useless code, this compiler pass will have a significant impact. The key idea is to quantify how a compiler transformation affects a code and feed this information to a deep learning framework, i.e., we leverage the fact that compiler transformations impact codes based on their properties to guide the overall optimization process.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once the programs have been compiled with custom flag sequences into IR and subsequently graphs, we feed a graph- based deep learning framework with the programs' graphs along with a best configuration to use for the programs. We note that the best configuration is only defined by exploring the space of configuration once with the default compiler settings. The resulting deep learning model predicts the best configuration for a new unknown application with its default compiler settings. The model just needs to recompile the application with a custom flag sequence selected either by a model or by simply picking the most efficient one at training.\n",

While the TEXT mentions the implementation of \"inherent diverse redundant safety mechanisms\" as a key strategy for optimization for safety in AI-based software elements, the PAPER_CONTENT largely focuses on the risks associated with overconfident AI models in autonomous driving applications. The paper explores the causes and consequences of such overconfidence and reviews various methods aimed at managing these issues, proposing solutions to enhance AI model safety through diverse redundant safety architectures. The concept of a \"diverse, redundant safety mechanism\" is mentioned as a proposed approach to mitigate the risks of overconfident AI models, but it isn't explicitly stated as a 'key strategy in optimization for safety' as the TEXT suggests. Instead, it is part of a broader discussion on addressing the problem of overconfidence in AI models within the paper.\n",

These AI-based software elements are crucial for various real-time decision-making processes within autonomous vehicles, such as multi-modal perception, motion planning, lane keeping, and emergency braking. A substantial concern highlighted is the models' ability to generalize and function effectively even when encountering scenarios absent from their training data, often leading to overconfidence. This overconfidence can result in misclassifications and incorrect predictions, endangering both the autonomous vehicle and its surroundings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the root causes of AI overconfidence and surveys existing mitigation techniques, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. One of the main contributions of the paper is the proposition of a \"diverse, redundant safety mechanism\" integrated into the AI element architecture. By combining conventional methods' strengths, this approach aims to create a balanced system in which multiple safety measures are employed to increase the reliability and safety of AI-driven decisions. The mechanism incorporates a majority voter or plausibility checker as pivotal elements to reduce false positives and negatives, enhancing the overall AI model reliability.\n",

      "The authors review the current state of the art related to AI confidence and propose new solutions to improve safety through diverse redundant safety mechanisms. These safety measures are then analyzed to understand their impact on AI element reliability. The remainder of the paper discusses overconfident AI model issues, definitions critical for understanding solution, and reviews the state of the art, ultimately proposing the authors’ solutions, with a conclusion and outlook for future work.\n",

The proposed approach, as mentioned in the blog, leads to a speedup of 48x compared to the default schedulers, which supports the blog's emphasis on improved throughput due to proper allocation of resources.

The figures match those in the summary, with completion times improved by approximately 3.19 times and GPU utilization increased by 42 times over non-sharing schemes. [2]\n",

      "3. The blog accurately captures the essence of **\"Spatial Sharing of GPU for Autotuning DNN models\"** by Dhakal et al. It notes the impact of spatial sharing on GPU utilization, throughput, and latency, confirming that a model tuned with an appropriate amount of GPU resources achieves consistent inference latency across a range of resource availabilities. The post correctly mentions a throughput increase by a factor of 5 and a significant reduction in DNN autotuning time. [3]\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lastly, **\"MISO: Exploiting Multi-Instance GPU Capability on Multi-Tenant Systems for Machine Learning\"** by Li et al. is correctly cited for its contribution to dynamic resource allocation techniques. The results mentioned in the blog, including a 49% decrease in average job completion time over unpartitioned schemes, are verifiable and precisely stated as per the summary of the paper. [4]\n",

      "Chai empowers users to create and interact with customized chatbots, offering unique and engaging experiences. Despite the exciting prospects, the work recognizes the inherent challenges of a commitment to modern safety standards. Therefore, this paper presents the integrated AI safety principles into Chai to pri- oritize user safety, data protection, and ethical technology use. The paper specifically explores the multidimensional domain of AI safety re- search, demonstrating its application in Chai's conversational chatbot platform. It presents Chai's AI safety principles, informed by well- established AI research centres and adapted for chat AI. This work proposes the following safety framework: Content Safeguarding; Sta- bility and Robustness; and Operational Trans- parency and Traceability. The subsequent im- plementation of these principles is outlined, fol- lowed by an experimental analysis of Chai's AI safety framework's real-world impact. We em- phasise the significance of conscientious appli- cation of AI safety principles and robust safety measures. The successful implementation of the safe AI framework in Chai indicates the practicality of mitigating potential risks for re- sponsible and ethical use of AI technologies. The ultimate vision is a transformative AI tool fostering progress and innovation while priori- tizing user safety and ethical standards.\n",

      "With the rapid improvement in the quality and flu- ency of virtual conversational AI agents, there has been growing integration of chat-based based AI systems (Chat AIs) into a range of real-world ap- plications (Caldarini et al., 2022; Almansor and Hussain, 2020). This has led to the development of new technologies and opportunities, as seen in plat- forms such as the Chai research platform. The Chai research platform is an innovative online platform that empowers users to design and interact with\n",
      "\n",
      "chatbots that emulate friends, mentors, or fictional characters (Irvine et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, with this flexibility comes potential challenges. If unregulated, there's a risk that users, intentionally or unintentionally, might design chat- bots that do not align to desired ethical and safe AI standards. This potential issue highlights the impor- tance of robust safety measures to prevent harmful outcomes, such as promoting inappropriate content or negatively impacting user well-being (Lu et al., 2023). This paper addresses safety considerations for Chat AI and introduces the AI safety princi- ples integrated into the Chai platform to ensure that deployed chat ai technologies best align with mod- ern safe AI practices (Schuett et al., 2023). Safe AI is about developing and managing AI systems that work in a manner that is beneficial to human- ity and encourages generation of safe content. It involves prioritising user safety, protecting data, and ensuring that the technology behaves ethically and responsibly (Mohseni et al., 2022). In this pa- per, we detail our three main chat ai safety pillars; content safeguarding (Awad et al., 2018), system stability and robustness (Drenkow et al., 2021), and operational transparency and traceability (Wanner et al., 2022). The second part of this paper then discusses how these considerations are practically integrated into chat ai platforms, where we detail the strategies taken that reinforces Chai's commit- ment to creating a safe AI conversational platform.\n",

      "## 2 Background\n",
      "\n",
      "AI safety, as a field of study, is dedicated to un- derstanding and mitigating the potential risks as- sociated with the development and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies (Bostrom, 2014; Schuett et al., 2023). The primary concern re- volves around ensuring alignment (Christian, 2020; Gabriel and Ghazavi, 2021) of these technologies with human values, ethics, and societal norms (Yud- kowsky, 2011). This involves designing AI systems\n",
      "\n",
      "that can understand, learn from, and act in accor- dance with the principles, values, and goals that humans hold (Gabriel, 2020; Sotala and Yampol- skiy, 2014). The objective is to create artificial intelligence that not only improves efficiency and productivity but also respects human autonomy, privacy, and other core ethical principles (Dignum, 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to achieve this, AI safety re- search (Mohseni et al., 2022) is multidimensional, involving elements of computer science, cognitive science, ethics, and social science (Fishbein and Ajzen, 2005; Sarma and Hay, 2017). Researchers investigate technical aspects like robustness, inter- pretability, and transparency of AI systems, while also exploring philosophical questions about moral and ethical considerations regarding how we define human values (Turchin, manuscript; Muehlhauser and Helm, 2012; Friedman and Hendry, 2019). A range of approaches explore how to effectively in- corporate defined human values within reward func- tions used to train AI systems (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Soares et al., 2015; Ng and Russell, 2000; Riedl and Harrison, 2016; Armstrong; Etzioni and Etzioni, 2016). The ultimate aim is to ensure that\n",
      "\n",
      "the vast transformative power of AI is harnessed in a manner that is safe, responsible, and beneficial for all of humanity (Taylor et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we outline the approach used to incoporate modern AI safety standards within gen- erative AI technology for Chai's conversational chatbot platform (Irvine et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3 AI Safety Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section we analyse the different important considerations that various well-established AI re- search centres have proposed, and then use this to propose three main pillars that define Chai's AI safety principles for a conversational chatbot plat- form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deepmind outline three core AI safety principles (Leike et al., 2017); specification, robustness and assurance. Meta's pillars of responsible AI (Pesenti, 2021) are privacy, security, fairness, transparency and accountability. While OpenAI's tenants (Will- ner) include the reduction of harm, fostering trust, and continuous improvement. We analyse the dif- ferent proposed pillars and aggregate them into the following main categories, with a consideration of how to align these definitions best for chat AI:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Content Safeguarding Content safeguarding\n",
      "\n",
      "aims to encourage chat AI systems to gener- ate responses (content) that are aligned with human values such that they do not cause any risk to users. This includes ensuring that the system generates any appropriate, ethical con- tent and that the system remains respectful to users, as well as adhering to modern standards of morality and ethics (Awad et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Stability and Robustness Stable and Ro- bust systems can handle diverse situations without failing- whether that be possible do- main/distributional shifts (Liusie et al., 2022; Malinin et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2023) or user perturbations, such as adversarial attacks (Raina and Gales, 2023; Chakraborty et al., 2018), that it might encounter when deployed. Robust systems act in a predictable manner and do not exhibit any unexpected behaviour, even in environments that are different from the standard training domain (Shafique et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Operational Transparency and Traceabil- ity This refers to creators having the ability to interpret, observe, audit and track all system activity (Mora-Cantallops et al., 2021; Räuker et al., 2023; Wanner et al., 2022). For exam- ple, this can be achieved by having logs of all past system activity which can be analysed for quality control, allowing developers to de- termine the cause of any possible undesirable behaviour at an early stage. Early detection of unsafe AI behaviour allows for intervention, e.g. via human action or activation/tripping of safety mechanisms before the undesired AI behaviour progresses further (Schwalbe and Schels, 2020).\n",

The authors of the paper, as mentioned in the TEXT, correctly align with those listed in the PAPER_CONTENT (Xiaoding Lu, Aleksey Korshuk, Zongyi Liu, William Beauchamp). However, the TEXT claims these are Chai's \"AI safety principles,\" which from the PAPER_CONTENT appears to be an accurate description as the principles are indeed related to AI Safety. Although the TEXT mentions these are \"another optimization strategy for AI systems,\" the PAPER_CONTENT focuses more on safety and ethical aspects rather than optimization per se. The summary correctly identifies the goal of integrating multidimensional safety research into AI platforms, in this case, the Chai platform.\n",

      "The paper introduces the AI Safety Framework as implemented in the Chai platform, a chatbot platform that allows users to create and interact with various AI personas. The paper is written by Xiaoding Lu, Aleksey Korshuk, Zongyi Liu, and William Beauchamp from Chai Research. The work starts with an acknowledgment of the need for robust AI safety measures due to the rapid development of chat-based AI systems and their integration into real-world applications. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chai's platform approach includes a set of AI safety principles—Content Safeguarding, Stability and Robustness, and Operational Transparency and Traceability—which are informed by established AI research centers. Content Safeguarding aims for AI systems to generate appropriate and ethical content. Stability and Robustness ensure that the system can handle unexpected situations and maintain predictable behavior. Operational Transparency and Traceability allow for monitoring system activity and early intervention if undesirable behaviors arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper emphasizes the importance of aligning AI technologies with modern safety standards, ensuring user safety, data protection, and ethical use of technology. Researchers explore technical and philosophical aspects of AI safety, including the alignment of AI systems with human principles, values, and goals. The paper also discusses the challenges in embedding human values within AI programming and the importance of creating AI that is beneficial for humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the AI safety framework as applied to the Chai platform includes safety principles that aim to protect users, ensure robust performance and ethical behavior of AI systems, and provide means to track and audit AI behaviors to uphold safety and ethical standards.\n",

      "Abstract-There is a large space of NUMA and hardware prefetcher configurations that can significantly impact the per- formance of an application. Previous studies have demonstrated how a model can automatically select configurations based on the dynamic properties of the code to achieve speedups. This paper demonstrates how the static Intermediate Representation (IR) of the code can guide NUMA/prefetcher optimizations without the prohibitive cost of performance profiling. We propose a method to create a comprehensive dataset that includes a diverse set of intermediate representations along with optimum configurations. We then apply a graph neural network model in order to validate this dataset. We show that our static intermediate representation based model achieves 80% of the performance gains provided by expensive dynamic performance profiling based strategies. We further develop a hybrid model that uses both static and dynamic information. Our hybrid model achieves the same gains as the dynamic models but at a reduced cost by only profiling 30% of the programs.\n",

      "Thread-level parallelism increases data demand to the main centralized memory. Complex memory hierarchies, caches, and prefetching methods that identify access patterns and fetch the data ahead of time try to solve this but have not scaled with the data demand, thus limiting the performance gains. To continuously sustain memory scaling, multi-core systems were forced to adopt the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) memory design. NUMA systems provide a separate memory for each processor, thereby increasing overall bandwidth and reducing congestion through the centralized memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resulting complex hardware exposes a large parameter space that must be explored for efficient application execution. Many tuning strategies and heuristics have been implemented to explore NUMA threads [1]-[3] and pages [4]-[6], as well as prefetching [7]-[9]. A common method is to build models on performance counters [10]-[12]. While executing the programs, performance metrics, that describe the execution behavior, are collected to guide the choice of the optimization online [6], [13] or offline [14], [15]. For instance, if we observe many remote accesses from a single node, it can be efficient to scatter the pages to the rest of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Models either rely on expert knowledge or on automatic machine learning approaches [16], [17]. Analytical models are understood by researchers but are difficult to adapt to the constant ongoing evolution of software and hardware. As a result more and more Machine Learning (ML) models are emerging [11]. There is a trade-off between the overhead and the complexity of the ML model and the output prediction accuracy. More advanced techniques such as deep learning can produce better predictions but require significantly more data. As a result, deep learning frameworks are not currently applied to guide NUMA/prefetching due to both the search size and the prohibitive cost of performance profiling [12].\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, collecting performance counters is very time con- suming, preventing the collection of thousands of samples re- quired for deep learning. Even worse, some hardware systems have custom performance counters. In other words, models targeting one system are not portable to another system as they have different sets of performance counters.\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper proposes a novel code characterization method that avoids the prohibitive cost of dynamically profiling ap- plications while providing valuable information that can be used to guide the optimization of programs with deep learning strategies. Our method statically collects data and thus enables the usage of advanced deep learning strategies to deliver com- petitive results. Moreover, our approach automatically identi- fies cases where only using static information is sufficient for optimization, and thus only collects dynamic information if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We start by compiling applications with different flag se- quences. Disparate compiler optimizations expose different properties of the code. For instance, the dead code elimination compiler pass removes useless blocks in the application. If a code has large blocks of useless code, this compiler pass will have a significant impact. The key idea is to quantify how a compiler transformation affects a code and feed this information to a deep learning framework, i.e., we leverage the fact that compiler transformations impact codes based on their properties to guide the overall optimization process.\n",
      "\n",
      "We use existing Intermediate Representation (IR) embed- ding techniques [18] to quantify the impact of a compiler pass [19]. The intermediate representation of a code can be\n",
      "\n",
      "Accepted at IPDPS 2022\n",
      "\n",
      "represented by a graph which is used by graph neural networks (GNN) as input to produce a vector as output. We expect that similar codes will have similar vector representations for the GNN outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the programs have been compiled with custom flag sequences into IR and subsequently graphs, we feed a graph- based deep learning framework with the programs' graphs along with a best configuration to use for the programs. We note that the best configuration is only defined by exploring the space of configuration once with the default compiler settings. The resulting deep learning model predicts the best configuration for a new unknown application with its default compiler settings. The model just needs to recompile the application with a custom flag sequence selected either by a model or by simply picking the most efficient one at training.\n",
      "\n",
      "We demonstrate the capabilities of our characterization technique by training a deep learning framework over NUMA and prefetch configurations considering two hardware micro- architectures: Intel Sandy Bridge and Intel Skylake.\n",
      "\n",
      "While operating only on static information, our model is able to achieve 80% of gains provided by dynamic approaches. We further show how our model is able to predict configu- rations across different micro-architectures by training it for one micro-architecture and applying it to another (e.g., trained on Sandy Bridge and applied to Skylake). We also illustrate how a hybrid approach consisting of both static and dynamic information can help to achieve the same performance gains as dynamic approaches while only profiling 30% of the codes.

      "\n",
      "Performance counters are commonly used to represent ap- plications [10], [12], [20]. One drawback of this representation is its cost. We need to profile the application by executing it. Moreover, this representation is hardware specific, thus limiting the cross-architecture characterization. An alternative to avoid these issues is to apply natural language techniques on the source code to represent the applications [21]-[23]. They mainly consider source code as a sequence of tokens. However, this representation ignores the rich structural information that can be essential for a model to characterize an application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies [24]-[27] include this missing structural information from the source code, by representing the applica- tions as graph structures. Different types of graphs are used. For example, Nair et al. [28] use the control flow graph of each program in order to learn if two programs are similar. Allamanis et al. [25] augment the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of programs by introducing additional edges in the AST, and show that with augmented AST, a Graph Neural Network can predict variable names and variable misuses.\n",

      "Recently, Cummins et al. [29] proposed a comprehensive graph representation called ProGraML based on the Inter- mediate Representation (IR) of the programs. Unlike most approaches which rely on control flow or AST, they construct a graph with three different flows: control flow, data flow and call flow. Their proposed graph representation sets new state-of-the-art results on a number of downstream tasks like algorithm classification. Given the comprehensiveness of their graph representation, we specifically reuse their approach in order to generate graphs for programs in our dataset.\n",

      "In the world of machine learning (ML), code optimization is akin to a relentless quest for efficiency and speed—a task that has evolved considerably from the hand-tuned efforts of yesteryears to today’s breakthrough AI-driven methodologies. Historically, code optimization in ML was a craft mastered by specialists with an intricate understanding of both algorithm intricacies and hardware specifications. The early approaches required a granular level of control, often resulting in labor-intensive, manual tuning to achieve desired performance outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to the present, and the landscape has undergone a seismic shift. Notably, the emergence of refined software frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch marked a transitional period towards automated optimizations, abstracting the complexity of code efficiency from machine learning developers and enabling a broader range of individuals to contribute to the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, it is the advent of sophisticated learning-based methods that truly revolutionizes code optimization. A particularly influential work by Sun et al. (2019) delivers an exhaustive survey of various optimization techniques, accentuating their transformative impact on machine learning (Sun et al., 2019). Machine learning not only reshapes existing optimization methods but is also used to directly enhance compiler efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building on these advancements, recent research has seen the rise of groundbreaking technologies that make optimization processes more cost-effective without sacrificing performance. TehraniJamsaz et al. (2022) explore this promising domain, unveiling hybrid models that integrate static and dynamic data to reduce the overhead of performance profiling, bringing a new level of efficiency to optimization practices (TehraniJamsaz et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The current trajectory points towards a future where AI not only powers the development of machine learning models but also curates the environment they operate within. Ensuring the AI systems we deploy are both high-performing and cost-effective, machine learning code optimization stands as a bedrock of reliable and sustainable AI solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting upon the range of literature in machine learning and AI optimization, one can perceive an academic and industry-wide collaboration dedicated to refining the operational backbone of these technologies. Without a comprehensive knowledge graph available for reference, this collaborative ethos can still be gleaned from a multitude of papers, interactions, and implementations that push the boundaries of what is possible in code optimization. As such, the convergence of machine learning and code optimization continues to unfold, with researchers and practitioners forging new paths toward innovation and efficiency.\n",

      "The paper addresses the critical need for comprehensive safety evaluations for advanced AI systems. It acknowledges the challenges associated with the current diverse practices and terminologies used across various communities, such as AI, software engineering, and governance, as well as the complexity of evaluating AI systems when considering their composite AI and non-AI components and the environmental contexts they operate within.\n",

      "To address these challenges, the authors propose a framework that includes three main components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Harmonizing terminology related to AI system evaluation to ensure consistent communication across different disciplines. The paper provides a table with clear definitions of terms used in the evaluation of AI systems, such as Narrow AI, General AI, Evaluation, Model Evaluation, System Evaluation, and others. \n",

      "2. Presenting a taxonomy that identifies the essential elements necessary for a comprehensive AI system evaluation, including both model-level and system-level considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Mapping the AI lifecycle to necessary evaluations, emphasizing the responsibility of stakeholders throughout the AI supply chain. This link between lifecycle stages and evaluations is designed to ensure accountability and thorough safety checks at each point.\n",

      "Creating high performance implementations of deep learn- ing primitives on CPUs is a challenging task. Multiple con- siderations including multi-level cache hierarchy, and wide SIMD units of CPU platforms influence the choice of pro- gram transformations to apply for performance optimization. In this paper, we present machine learning powered compiler techniques to optimize loop nests. We take a two-pronged approach to code optimization: We first apply high level op- timizations to optimize the code to take optimal advantage of the cache memories. Then, we perform low level, target- specific optimizations to effectively vectorize the code to run well on the SIMD units of the machine. For high level opti- mizations, we use polyhedral compilation techniques and deep learning approaches. For low level optimization, we use a target specific code generator that generates code using vec- tor intrinsics and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to find the optimal parameters for the code generator. We per- form experimental evaluation of the developed techniques on various matrix multiplications that occur in popular deep learning workloads. The experimental results show that the compiler techniques presented in the paper achieve 7.6X and 8.2X speed-ups over a baseline for sequential and parallel runs respectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "Deep learning (DL) has become pervasive in various domains of computing. Image recognition [14, 17], language model- ing [10], language translation [31], speech recognition [15] make extensive use of deep neural networks (DNNs). Deep Learning inference is an important workload across appli- cations, such as object classification & recognition, text and speech translation etc. A 2018 Mc Kinsey study [5] pointed out that in datacenters, 75% of the inference tasks are run on CPUs. Optimizing DL workloads on CPUs is a challenging proposition because of architectural complexities of CPU\n",

      "platforms. Multi-level cache hierarchies, TLBs (Translation Look-aside Buffers), hardware data prefetchers, SIMD (a.k.a vector) units present particular challenges in writing high performance code. Therefore, the current state-of-practice is to use expert-coded high performance libraries such as Intel oneDNN [3] in deep learning frameworks such as Tensor- Flow and PyTorch to achieve good performance. However, being reliant on libraries for performance is not scalable. First, it would increase the time-to-market: from the time a new DL operator is invented to its being supported in a library could take a considerable amount of time. Second, even expert programmers must invest significant amount of effort to tune the implementations on the target platforms. Therefore, an attractive alternative solution is to develop compilation techniques that automate code optimization and achieve similar performance levels as expert-coded libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to auto- matic code optimization. We categorize the program opti- mizations into two phases: high level and low level optimiza- tions. High level optimizations perform loop optimizations such as loop reordering and tiling to derive a loop struc- ture that utilizes the cache hierarchy of the computer sys- tem to the fullest extent possible. Low level optimizations generate vector code using the target machine's intrinsics; reinforcement learning methodology guides the derivation of high performance vector code. For high-level and low- level optimizations we leverage artificial intelligence (A.I.) techniques. We evaluate our automated compiler system on GEMMs which lie at the heart of deep learning [1]. The re- sults indicate our compiler workflow delivers competitive performance compared to Intel oneDNN library and signif- icantly higher performance compared to a state-of-the-art DL compiler, viz., AutoTVM [9].\n",

      "· A systematic approach to program optimization with clear demarcation of high-level and low-level optimiza- tions that map well to the hardware architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Low-level optimizations that generate reinforcement learning (RL) guided vector intrinsics based code.\n",

      "\n",
      "· Experimental evaluation on various GEMM sizes that occur in DL workloads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the overall compilation workflow. Section 3 de- scribes the polyhedral compilation techniques we use for high level optimizations. The low-level optimizations involv- ing the target platform specific code generator and reinforce- ment learning are developed in Section 4. The experimental evaluation conducted is detailed in Section 5. Related work is discussed in Section 6. The conclusion and implication of the presented work are presented in Section 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2 THE COMPILER OPTIMIZATION WORKFLOW\n",
      "\n",
      "We first describe the overall compiler workflow. We input the loop nests such as GEMMs to the compiler. The high level optimizer first optimizes the loop structure and then passes on the code to the low level optimer. Figure 1 shows the workflow of the optimization process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The high level optimizer uses polyhedral compilation tech- niques for optimization of the loop structure to take advan- tage of the multi-level caches of the CPU platform. The loop reordering and tiling transformations are applied and the best loop order and tile sizes are determined by the high level optimizer. It will enhance data locality - both the spa- tial and temporal locality such that the data used by the input program is reused out of the caches closest to the pro- cessor as much as possible. Section 3 details the polyhedral compilation techniques we apply for loop optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The high level optimer then hands over the optimized code to the low-level optimizer. The low level optimizer derives a vectorization strategy for effective use of the SIMD vector units. We employ a target specific low level optimization approach wherein the inner loops of the loop nest are vec- torized using the target-specific vector intrinsics. Further, we use a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to select the best vectorization plan among the myriad choices available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jouppi et al [16] show that 95% of the deep learning infer- ence workloads (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) can be formulated in terms of matrix-multiplication. Matrix multiplication is at the heart of deep learning [1]. Because of these reasons in this work, we build the low level optimizer to optimize the matrix-multiplications that occur in the inner most loops of\n",
      "\n",
      "convolutions and matrix-multiplications themselves (matrix- multiplication can be recursively defined where the other loops of the code are the tiled loops and the inner loops are also functionally equivalent to matrix-multiplication). In Section 4, we describe the design and the implementation of the low level optimizer for the inner loops of the loop nest focused on matrix multiplication.\n",

      "AI-based systems have been used widely across various in- dustries for different decisions ranging from operational de- cisions to tactical and strategic ones in low- and high-stakes contexts. Gradually the weaknesses and issues of these sys- tems have been publicly reported including, ethical issues, bi- ased decisions, unsafe outcomes, and unfair decisions, to name a few. Research has tended to optimize AI less has fo- cused on its risk and unexpected negative consequences. Ac- knowledging this serious potential risks and scarcity of re- search I focus on unsafe outcomes of AI. Specifically, I ex- plore this issue from a Human-AI interaction lens during AI deployment. It will be discussed how the interaction of indi- viduals and AI during its deployment brings new concerns, which need a solid and holistic mitigation plan. It will be dis- cussed that only AI algorithms' safety is not enough to make its operation safe. The AI-based systems' end-users and their decision-making archetypes during collaboration with these systems should be considered during the AI risk manage- ment. Using some real-world scenarios, it will be highlighted that decision-making archetypes of users should be consid- ered a design principle in AI-based systems.\n",

      "AI and its backbone technologies are advancing on an un- precedented scale (Schiffet. al. 2020). This fast develop- ment of AI models leads to the emerging of various AI-pow- ered products and services. Top tech companies, including Google, Amazon, and Apple, develop and use these prod- ucts to provide better services to their customers, gaining significant publicity. This publicity reinforces the role of AI in fast development for other companies including, small- medium enterprises across various sectors (Hansen, & Bøgh 2021). At the same time, there are serious discussions and debates on AI misconducts or shortcomings such as unfair out- comes, gender discrimination, biased decisions, dangerous actions (Turchin, & Denkenberger 2021). Since this backlash primarily targeted the AI community, various new research directions and domains have emerged as a response includ- ing, AI fairness, Explainable AI, Human-AI interaction, Ethical AI, and AI safety (Foulds et al. 2020, Mathews 2019., Amershi et al. 2019). However to have the robust, fair, safe,\n",

      "Figure 1 depicts an exemplar AI-powered product's main two stages or lifecycle. The first part is their development stage, which may involve the specific dataset of the com- pany. For simplicity, the team that developed the AI-pow- ered product is named the \"service provider,\" and it has been assumed they are sitting outside the company. The service provider either produces the product on an (i) large scale or develops an (ii) customized one. Referring to those two stages, the main focus of AI safety literature is the \"devel- opment stage,\" and there is not much work on the second part, the \"deployment stage.\" Thereby the devised safety mechanism in the development stage is only half of the so- lution and safety guard.\n",

      "Some of the main AI safety challenges during the \"deploy- ment stage\" from the human interaction lens will be dis- cussed in this work. This is due to the AI safety literature gap in considering the safety issues related to end-users per- spectives, needs, interactions, and roles. AI will be more ro- bust and safe when the AI developers consider its lifecycle challenges. AI-Powered products' end users are naturally di- verse, ranging from the organization's top managers, middle managers, knowledge workers to their customers. They also have diverse attitudes towards AI-Powered products and different experiences and expertise. Among the heterogene- ous end-users, we have cohorts with (i) No technical back- ground of AI, (ii) general understanding of AI models, (iii) being skeptical about AI and its power, (IV) believing in AI as an ultimate solution, to name a few. Unfortunately, there is not much work, tools, or methods that can support top managers in choosing the right AI-Powered product accord- ing to their organization's need and culture. That's why looking at AI as a service enabler that leads to the product or service is essential in those newly emerged fields of AI and AI safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, the impact of knowledge workers with differ- ent decision-making archetypes on AI safety will be dis- cussed. To this end, three types of knowledge workers' atti- tudes towards AI-powered products will be considered as depicted in Figure 1, namely, \"Skeptics,\" \"Interactors, \"and \"Delegators.\" Section 2 is devoted to describing these deci- sion-making archetypes with two toy examples that high- light their possible threads towards AI safety. In Section 3, classification models will be used as a reference. It will be discussed how changing the classifier metric from \"preci- sion\" to \"recall\" makes a given AI-Powered product safer for some cases and riskier for other scenarios. The possible consequences of these risks in not considering the knowledge workers' decision-making archetypes have been presented in Section 4 regarding the confusion matrix. A ho- listic risk map for each decision-making archetypes will be presented in Section 5 when we have an automatic AI prod- uct in place. The paper will be concluded with a short dis- cussion on the mitigating strategy during the \"deployment stage,\" considering the type of involved knowledge workers.\n",

      "This chapter formulates seven lessons for preventing harm in artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on insights from the field of system safety for software-based automation in safety-critical domains. New applications of AI across societal domains and public organizations and infrastructures come with new hazards, which lead to new forms of harm, both grave and pernicious. The text addresses the lack of consensus for diagnosing and eliminating new AI system hazards. For decades, the field of system safety has dealt with accidents and harm in safety-critical systems governed by varying degrees of software-based automation and decision-making. This field embraces the core assumption of systems and control that AI systems cannot be safeguarded by technical design choices on the model or algorithm alone, instead requiring an end-to-end hazard analysis and design frame that includes the context of use, impacted stakeholders and the formal and informal institutional environment in which the system operates. Safety and other values are then inherently socio-technical and emergent system properties that require design and control measures to instantiate these across the technical, social and institutional components of a system. This chapter honors system safety pioneer Nancy Leveson, by situating her core lessons for today's AI system safety challenges. For every lesson, concrete tools are offered for rethinking and reorganizing the safety management of AI systems, both in design and governance. This history tells us that effective AI safety management requires transdisciplinary approaches and a shared language that allows involvement of all levels of society.\n",

      "The emergence of AI systems in public services as well as in public spaces and infrastructures, has led to a plethora of new hazards, leading to accidents with fatal consequences (Raji and Dobbe, 2020) and increasing concerns over the risks posed to democratic institutions (Crawford et al., 2019). The criteria for identifying and diagnosing safety risks in complex social contexts remain unclear and contested. While various proposals have emerged specifying what it is we need to strive for in terms of dealing with ethical, legal and societal implications of AI systems, there still is a long way to go to understand how to translate such higher-level principles and requirements to the development as well as the operation and governance of these systems in practice (Mittelstadt, 2019; Dobbe et al., 2021). A system perspective is needed (Zuiderwijk et al., 2021) that facilitates the identification of (new) complex safety hazards in ways that do justice to those bearing the brunt of AI systems (Benjamin, 2020), and can contribute to strengthening the rule of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there is still considerable disagreement on what entails an appropriate definition of AI, recent policy efforts led by the OECD have converged on a seeing AI as a sociotechnical system with a complex lifecycle (OECD, 2021). Here we define sociotechnical AI systems as consisting of technical AI artefacts, human agents, and institutions, in which the AI artefact influences its real or virtual environment by automating, supporting or augmenting decision- making. The technical AI components in such a system may vary from logic or knowledge-based models to machine learning models to statistical or Bayesian to search or optimization methods. In systems engineering, safety is understood as an emergent property, which can only be instantiated and controlled for across the above-mentioned system elements (Leveson, 2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "Core to the establishment of a system perspective are lessons from decades of knowledge built up about what constitutes safety in systems subject to software-based automation. These lessons have become central to the or- ganization of many domains and markets, such as in aviation and healthcare. However, scanning both AI systems literature as well as policy proposals, it is evident that these lessons have yet to be absorbed. In this chapter, I provide an on-ramp into the system safety canon for different disciplines and people involved or invested in the safeguarding of AI systems. I center the seminal work of Nancy Leveson, a pioneer of system safety in engineering systems. In her magnum opus Engineering a safer world: systems thinking applied to safety, Leveson draws seven lessons based on recurring issues that hinder the safeguarding of complex systems subject to forms of soft-ware based automation (Leveson, 2012). I coin these the Leveson Lessons and interpret them for a variety of concrete challenges that are emerging for safeguarding AI systems in different domains.\n",

      "This paper, authored by Roel I.J. Dobbe, provides insights into preventing harm in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, drawing from the field of system safety in safety-critical domains. Dobbe discusses seven key lessons to consider for AI system safety, inspired by system safety pioneer Nancy Leveson's work. The paper addresses the emergence of new hazards and forms of harm as AI systems proliferate across various societal domains and public infrastructures, noting the lack of consensus on diagnosing and managing these risks. The central argument is that safety is an emergent socio-technical property that requires comprehensive design and control strategies that go beyond technical components to incorporate the broader context of application, including social and institutional factors. The paper advocates for a system perspective on AI safety, which is necessary for the effective identification of complex safety hazards. It promotes transdisciplinary approaches and shared language to involve all societal levels in AI safety management. Dobbe highlights the importance of historical lessons from system safety in other domains and proposes tools for rethinking and reorganizing the safety management of AI systems in both design and governance aspects. The paper signifies the role of system safety as crucial in ensuring safe AI integration within human society and institutions.\n",

      "FEEDBACK: The provided TEXT does not closely align with the stated content of the paper. While the TEXT mentions the implementation of \"inherent diverse redundant safety mechanisms\" as a key strategy for optimization for safety in AI-based software elements, the PAPER_CONTENT largely focuses on the risks associated with overconfident AI models in autonomous driving applications. The paper explores the causes and consequences of such overconfidence and reviews various methods aimed at managing these issues, proposing solutions to enhance AI model safety through diverse redundant safety architectures. The concept of a \"diverse, redundant safety mechanism\" is mentioned as a proposed approach to mitigate the risks of overconfident AI models, but it isn't explicitly stated as a 'key strategy in optimization for safety' as the TEXT suggests. Instead, it is part of a broader discussion on addressing the problem of overconfidence in AI models within the paper.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper examines the challenges and potential dangers posed by overconfident AI models in the context of autonomous driving systems. These AI-based software elements are crucial for various real-time decision-making processes within autonomous vehicles, such as multi-modal perception, motion planning, lane keeping, and emergency braking. A substantial concern highlighted is the models' ability to generalize and function effectively even when encountering scenarios absent from their training data, often leading to overconfidence. This overconfidence can result in misclassifications and incorrect predictions, endangering both the autonomous vehicle and its surroundings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the root causes of AI overconfidence and surveys existing mitigation techniques, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. One of the main contributions of the paper is the proposition of a \"diverse, redundant safety mechanism\" integrated into the AI element architecture. By combining conventional methods' strengths, this approach aims to create a balanced system in which multiple safety measures are employed to increase the reliability and safety of AI-driven decisions. The mechanism incorporates a majority voter or plausibility checker as pivotal elements to reduce false positives and negatives, enhancing the overall AI model reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors review the current state of the art related to AI confidence and propose new solutions to improve safety through diverse redundant safety mechanisms. These safety measures are then analyzed to understand their impact on AI element reliability. The remainder of the paper discusses overconfident AI model issues, definitions critical for understanding solution, and reviews the state of the art, ultimately proposing the authors’ solutions, with a conclusion and outlook for future work.\n",

The abstract and introduction set the stage by highlighting the widespread use of AI systems and the growing concerns over issues such as ethics, biases, unsafe outcomes, and unfair decisions. The paper argues that while there is significant research focusing on optimizing AI technologies, less attention has been given to the risks and negative consequences of AI, particularly from the perspective of human-AI interaction during the deployment stage of AI-powered products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper delineates the AI product lifecycle into the development stage and the deployment stage, noting that much of the safety research focuses on the former, with less on the latter. It advocates the necessity of a comprehensive safety approach that incorporates end-user considerations in the deployment stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In exploring the human factor, the author describes three decision-making archetypes of knowledge workers interacting with AI systems: \"Skeptics,\" \"Interactors,\" and \"Delegators.\" These archetypes range from those who disbelieve and disregard AI advice to those who wholeheartedly trust AI decisions and those who collaborate with AI for decision-making. The paper uses real-world scenarios to illustrate potential dangers in each archetype if their attitudes are not considered during AI design and risk management.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Regarding the implementation of inherent diverse redundant safety mechanisms, the text implies these mechanisms are a key optimization strategy for AI safety in software elements. However, the paper by Pitale, Abbaspour, and Upadhyay focuses more on managing overconfidence in AI models, proposing a balanced system with diverse redundant safety architectures to enhance reliability and safety. While related, the text could benefit from clarification that these mechanisms are part of a broader discussion on managing overconfidence in AI models rather than being stated as the 'key strategy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The description of Chai's AI safety principles—content safeguarding, stability and robustness, operational transparency, and traceability—is accurate and reflects the paper's focus on safety and ethics rather than optimization. I suggest adjusting the text to emphasize these principles as safety measures, ensuring user safety and ethical AI behavior, instead of an optimization strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The reference to the taxonomy for AI system evaluation aligns well with the paper by Xia, Lu, Zhu, and Xing. The text accurately reflects the paper's intention to streamline safety assessments with harmonized terminology and essential evaluation elements. No changes needed here.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The text on the human factor in AI safety by Saberi accurately portrays the need to consider human aspects in the deployment of AI systems. It's crucial for safe operation, and the paper's content supports this view. Keep this part of the text as is.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Finally, Dobbe's paper on system safety and AI is appropriately summarized in the text by highlighting the importance of socio-technical and emergent system properties in AI safety. This is indeed a key takeaway from Dobbe's work, and the text should maintain its current description.\n",
      "\n",

      "Abstract-The intersection of data visualization and human- robot interaction (HRI) is a burgeoning field. Understanding, communicating, and processing different kinds of data for creating versatile visualizations can benefit HRI. Conversely, expressing different kinds of data generated from HRI through effective visualizations can provide interesting insights. Our work adds to the literature of this growing domain. In this paper, we present our exploratory work on visualizing mental health data on a social robot. Particularly, we discuss development of mental health data visualizations using a participatory design (PD) approach. As a first step with mental health data visualization on a social robot, this work paves the way for relevant further work and using social robots as data visualization tools.\n",

      "Despite many opportunities for collaborative research in data visualization and HRI, not much work has been con- tributed to this intersection [6]. Some existing works of this area include visualizing data of children's touch patterns on a social robot [5]. Contributing to this promising domain's literature, we worked on developing visualizations of mental health data for a social robot. Social robots have been used to support mental health in various ways such as to help children with autism improve on their social skills [1]. They have been used to help older adults by reducing feelings of loneliness [3], and other populations. However, existing work only shows support for mental health through social robots by responding interactively to human activity to help them learn relevant skills. No work has shown the use of social robots as a means of visualizing mental health data. Therefore, our work is novel or first of its kind.\n",

The paper's content supports the claim that end-user involvement is considered key in designing effective communication of complex mental health data through social robots. The authors indeed focus on how participatory design can help in tailoring data visualizations to be more coherent and accessible for users, thus backing the statement made in the provided text. However, the text incorrectly cites the paper with the year \"2022\" as \"Karim et al., 2022\" when it should reference the arXiv preprint version with the identifier \"arXiv:2210.06469v1\" published on 20 Aug 2022.

      "Abstract-The exponential growth of data has outpaced human ability to process information, necessitating innovative approaches for effective human-data interaction. To transform raw data into meaningful insights, storytelling, and visualization have emerged as powerful techniques for communicating complex information to decision-makers. This article offers a compre- hensive, systematic review of the utilization of storytelling in visualizations. It organizes the existing literature into distinct categories, encompassing frameworks, data and visualization types, application domains, narrative structures, outcome measurements, and design principles. By providing a well-structured overview of this rapidly evolving field, the article serves as a valuable guide for educators, researchers, and practitioners seeking to harness the power of storytelling in data visualization.

      "S TORYTELLING stands as an age-old tradition, a cor- nerstone of human culture, ensuring the continuity of knowledge across generations. The power of stories emanates from their ability to engage our entire cognitive and emotional faculties, enabling us to empathize, connect, and understand the narrative's content. In our modern era, this storytelling tradition is being merged with data visualization, thereby becoming a crucial tool in comprehending complex data associated with global phenomena such as climate change, pandemics, and societal changes.\n",

      "However, the application of traditional storytelling to the rapidly evolving domain of information visualization is not without its challenges. This integration necessitates a deeper understanding of the nuances of classical storytelling and an exploration of its potential applicability to data-driven narratives. With various interpretations of storytelling across different domains, a holistic approach is required, one that merges these diverse perspectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper addresses these challenges, aiming to provide a comprehensive review of storytelling in the context of data and information visualization. We identify a dual-fold problem: the need to consolidate various perspectives on storytelling and the need to understand the potential application of traditional storytelling techniques in the context of data-driven narratives.\n",

      "Segel and Heer [176] provided the first comprehensive review of data storytelling and narrative visualizations in 2010, identifying specific design strategies and relevant interaction paradigms. Their analysis also delineated different categories within genres, a classification we have adopted for our analysis of visualization types and application areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building on this, Bach et al. [11] proposed grouping these genres into three categories based on their orientation: spatial, temporal, or a combination of both. Kosara and Mackinlay [102] further explored the role of the setting and audience within three scenarios: self-running presentations, moderator- guided live presentations, and presentations for individual or small groups, which allow for more specific interactions with the audience [165].\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Tong et al. [194] offered a two-dimensional classification for the literature, distinguishing between various elements, such as authoring tools, user engagement, narratives, and transitions, as well as between different access methods. Their analysis, however, only briefly touched upon certain aspects, which we address in our review by providing a comprehensive overview of the effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "More recently, Zhu et al. [227] published a survey on auto- matic infographic and visualization recommendations detailing how storytelling processes can be automated. Their work spans a range of related tools, models, and frameworks, from data- driven automatic visualizations and annotations to knowledge- based visualizations. We have integrated examples from their survey into our tools overview (see Fig. 6). Furthermore, Losev et al. [114] highlighted the need for leveraging diversity within the visualization community to foster new ideas and collaborations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the realm of journalism, Freixa Font et al. [67] provided a comprehensive overview of data-driven storytelling, underlining the importance of integrating interactivity and visualization. They discussed the potential of these techniques for engaging news readers, the tools and resources used in digital newsrooms, and the limitations of visual interactions. Similarly, Lopezosa et al. [113] argued for further analysis of data storytelling across different journalistic formats and reader perspectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these significant contributions, a comprehensive summary of the literature across various application and research domains remains lacking. Our review addresses this gap by offering an interdisciplinary overview of data story- telling, drawing on perspectives from Behavioral science, HCI research, Marketing research, Data-Interaction research, and Communication Science. We discuss theoretical frameworks and foundations, narrative structures and their goals, and data story types across different methodological settings. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive overview of cognitive and non- cognitive effects and their evaluation methods.\n",

      "Segel and Heer [176] provided the first comprehensive review of data storytelling and narrative visualizations in 2010, identifying specific design strategies and relevant interaction paradigms. Their analysis also delineated different categories within genres, a classification we have adopted for our analysis of visualization types and application areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building on this, Bach et al. [11] proposed grouping these genres into three categories based on their orientation: spatial, temporal, or a combination of both. Kosara and Mackinlay [102] further explored the role of the setting and audience within three scenarios: self-running presentations, moderator- guided live presentations, and presentations for individual or small groups, which allow for more specific interactions with the audience [165].\n",

[194] offered a two-dimensional classification for the literature, distinguishing between various elements, such as authoring tools, user engagement, narratives, and transitions, as well as between different access methods. Their analysis, however, only briefly touched upon certain aspects, which we address in our review by providing a comprehensive overview of the effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "More recently, Zhu et al. [227] published a survey on auto- matic infographic and visualization recommendations detailing how storytelling processes can be automated. Their work spans a range of related tools, models, and frameworks, from data- driven automatic visualizations and annotations to knowledge- based visualizations. We have integrated examples from their survey into our tools overview (see Fig. 6). Furthermore, Losev et al. [114] highlighted the need for leveraging diversity within the visualization community to foster new ideas and collaborations.\n",

      "In the realm of journalism, Freixa Font et al. [67] provided a comprehensive overview of data-driven storytelling, underlining the importance of integrating interactivity and visualization. They discussed the potential of these techniques for engaging news readers, the tools and resources used in digital newsrooms, and the limitations of visual interactions. Similarly, Lopezosa et al. [113] argued for further analysis of data storytelling across different journalistic formats and reader perspectives.\n",

Our review addresses this gap by offering an interdisciplinary overview of data story- telling, drawing on perspectives from Behavioral science, HCI research, Marketing research, Data-Interaction research, and Communication Science. We discuss theoretical frameworks and foundations, narrative structures and their goals, and data story types across different methodological settings. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive overview of cognitive and non- cognitive effects and their evaluation methods.\n",

We adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [149] as our review protocol, which entails four main steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, we initiated the review process with a Scopus database search, targeting the subject areas \"storytelling\" and \"visualization\", restricting to papers published before February 2023. The query string used was (TITLE-ABS-KEY (storytelling) ) AND (visuali?ation) . This initial phase yielded 1010 papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, each author received a random sample of 80 papers, with the task of mapping the core elements of their selection into a mind map. Collaboratively, we then identified individual categories and defined relevant inclusion and exclu- sion criteria. A custom-developed tool facilitated the process, enabling researchers to browse and tag individual papers with details such as source name, title, abstract, keywords, a \"tf-idf\" word cloud, and the publication year. Two authors reviewed each paper, categorizing it for inclusion or exclusion. In case of disagreement, a third author was involved in making a majority decision. Additionally, we manually searched for related work and incorporated additional papers into our sample (n = 9), leading to a total of 414 papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, we assigned each category to two authors, who divided all papers within their category for an in-depth read. We corrected any misclassifications and cross-checked them. Publications were rated by relevance and excluded if the full text did not meet our criteria. We held weekly meetings to discuss preliminary conclusions and address papers relevant to multiple or different categories. This stage resulted in 184 remaining publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, in the fourth step, we organized the remaining papers into a coherent context and summarized them within the respective sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three main exclusion criteria guided our review process. Firstly, we considered the relevance to the research question. Since we focus on data-driven stories, we excluded all papers that did not involve storytelling applied in the data context. This includes stories intended for entertainment or those visualizing qualitative data types in narrative visualizations. Secondly, we excluded papers that did not delve deeply into storytelling, such as those where storytelling was used descriptively or as a keyword. Lastly, we applied an incompatibility criterion, excluding papers not written in English or not published in peer-reviewed journals.\n",

      "The process of learning involves interaction with the learning environment through our five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). Until recently, distance education focused only on the first two of those senses, visual and auditory. Internet-based learning environments are predominantly based on visual with auditory components. With the advent of haptic technology we can now simulate/generate forces and, as a result, the sense of touch. The gaming industry has pushed the \"touch\" on the \"wire,\" allowing complex multimodal interactions online. In this article we provide a brief overview of the haptic technology evolution, potential for education, and existing challenges. We review recent data on the 21st century students' behaviors, and share our experiences in designing interactive haptic environments for education. From the \"Community of Inquiry\" framework perspective, we discuss the potential impact of haptic feedback on cognitive and social presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "As defined in the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, social presence is the ability of learners to project their personal characteristics into the CoI, thereby presenting themselves as real people, and form meaningful connections with others to enhance collaborative learning experiences. CoI also explains cognitive presence as the extent to which learners are able to construct and confirm meaning through reflection and discourse in a four-stage process. This starts with a triggering event, then moves through exploration and integration, and culminates with the achievement of resolution (Garrison, Anderson & Archer, 2001).\n",
      "\n",
      "From a distance learning environment perspective, haptic applications have the potential to significantly impact both types of presence discussed. There are two approaches for deployment of such applications:\n",
      "\n",
      "· Local deployment. The required simulation components are downloaded and executed locally. Such an approach, while shielded from the network impairment, does not provide a direct interaction with the instructor.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Remote deployment. The student and the instructor may haptically interact with each other. The sense of social presence is quantifiable in such cases, and is dependent on the network performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In what follows, we provide an overview of current technologies for creation of multimodal virtual environments, and a few related research efforts. We also discuss a case study that demonstrates the potential of haptic technology to affect the way students connect with each other and engage in the exploration of content.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Multimodal Virtual Environments as Learning Tools\n",
      "\n",
      "A Multimodal Virtual Environment (MVE) provides multiple modalities to convey information. In the past the combination of audio and visual modalities made possible the production of illustrative explanations of various concepts, thus breaking the barriers of verbal communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Haptic, derived from the Greek haphe, means pertaining to the sense of touch. Another derivation is from the verb haptesthai, meaning to touch. Haptic technology is employed in the interface as input/output stimuli between the user and the computer. The communication is enabled via applied tactile and force feedback, or vibrations and motions in other words. The output stimuli can simulate the sensation of touching a virtual object. MVEs with visual, auditory, and, additionally, haptic stimuli can convey information more efficiently than with the use of a single sense, since the user manipulates and experiences the environment through multiple sensory channels. Each modality allows information exchange between the instructor and the student, establishing an experientially rich\n",
      "\n",
      "communication channel. Each communication channel, taken individually, has a specific communication bandwidth, dependent on the student capacity to use it. The bandwidth of the combination of these channels may be larger than their sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kinesthetic learners, who make up about 15% of the population, struggle to fully grasp concepts by just reading or listening (Coffield, Moseley, Hall, Ecclestone, 2004). Without the haptic channel, the quality and amount of information conveyed through an interface is reduced, resulting in a narrower communication bandwidth and less efficiency during the learning process. This reduction negatively affects the cognitive results obtained through distance education and sets a barrier in adopting it on the same reliability basis as face-to-face education. As such, haptics may provide a medium to learn by doing, through first-person experience, enriching the environment presented through visual and auditory modalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Statistics on Students in the 21st Century\n",
      "\n",
      "The current demographics of students, known as Millennials or Generation Y (Naomi Rockler-Gladen, 2006), have had an extensive exposure to vast arrays of technology, and are much better adapted to applying these technologies in learning environments than the previous generations. Bialeschki (2007) points to the rapid growth of technology as an aspect that must be considered in developing content for all learners, but particularly for the current generation, who have grown up with higher expectations of learning technologies. High multimedia expectations coupled with low attention spans increase the challenge of engaging a student in learning activities by conventional pedagogical methods. Cognitive studies have shown that students are more apt to learn if the method of exposure engages them. If students could apply their technological proficiency at a greater extent, to their learning objectives, they could more easily understand difficult and abstract concepts and better relate new information to what they already understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data from 2009 indicates that the Internet usage has increased 362%, to almost 25% of the world population, in the last decade (Internet World Statistics, 2009). A recent study (Jones, 2009) shows that 30% of Internet users are Generation Y (born between 1977-1990). Moreover, according to Walsh and colleagues (2006), computer games are becoming an addiction for the new generation, as 45% of the most prolific gamers are 6 to 17 years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surveys conducted in Europe show that 96% of all schools have Internet access today, and 67% of schools already have a broadband connection. Furthermore, 90% of classroom teachers use computers or Internet to prepare lessons, and 74% use computers as a teaching aid. Yet, the number vary widely, from the UK (96%) and Denmark (95%) to Greece (36%) and Latvia (35%) (New Europe, 2006).\n",
      "\n",
      "One conclusion is that interactive technologies are relevant in drawing students' attention, and the incorporation of these technologies should be considered a key proposition in curriculum development. Specifically, the technologies that have the potential for influencing the largest number of learners should be of the highest priority.\n",

      "Today's computer networks have been designed to carry information that pertains primarily to two human senses: the auditory sense (e.g., sound and speech), and the visual sense (e.g., video, graphic, and text). Internet is now being reengineered to provide different levels of service for different types of traffic, such as supporting the transport of voice-over-IP protocol. Some current network architectures can support different Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allowing networks to carry information relating to other senses will open up an enormous potential for both new and dramatically improved applications. The ability to embed the sense of touch or force feedback into applications and then distribute them across the Internet may have a significant impact on distance learning and training. It is now a fact that the introduction of haptic components into interactive games has increased users' quality of experience, and, as a result, the market demand for these types of applications. As an example, Falcon NovintTM is an affordable haptic device for gaming that may reach millions of game players in a few years (Manhattan Scientifics, 2009).\n",

      "This paper discusses the enhancement of distance education by integrating haptic technology to simulate the sense of touch, thereby facilitating multimodal interactions including visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli. The paper first establishes the importance of involving various senses in the learning process and indicates how haptic technology has evolved with potentially significant impacts on cognitive and social presence within online learning environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "It outlines two approaches to deploying haptic applications: local and remote deployments, each with their implications for interaction and social presence. Furthermore, the paper provides a detailed examination of Multimodal Virtual Environments (MVEs) as tools for education, emphasizing the particular benefits for kinesthetic learners. The use of multiple sensory channels is posited to convey information more efficiently and create a richer communication channel, potentially leading to more effective teaching and learning experiences.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper delves into the intersection of data visualization and human-robot interaction by presenting an exploratory study on mental health data visualizations that are displayed on a social robot using participatory design. The study involved collecting mood and stress data from university campus participants over a five-weekday period. This data was then visualized on the social robot in real-time using JavaScript and the AnyChart library.\n",

      "The \"TEXT\" provided is largely consistent with the \"PAPER_CONTENT\" section of the systematic review \"Telling stories with data\" by Kay Schröder and colleagues. The text asserts that the paper provides a comprehensive assessment of narrative techniques in concert with data visualization to enhance the understanding and retention of complex information, which is confirmed by the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. However, the \"TEXT\" states the year as \"2023,\" which contradicts the paper's actual publication year of \"2022\" as evidenced by the provided arXiv identifier (arXiv:2312.01164v1) indicating a December 2nd (Typically '2312' representing the year and month) upload. Additionally, the authors' emphasis on interdisciplinary perspectives, theoretical foundations, narrative structures, taxonomy, and cognitive and non-cognitive effects, mentioned in the TEXT, are indeed discussed in the PAPER_CONTENT.

      "The paper provides a systematic review of how storytelling and visualization techniques are utilized to convey complex data-driven narratives effectively. It is concerned with the exponential growth of data and the need for innovative methods to help humans process and understand this information. Through an examination of existing literature, the paper identifies and categorizes key areas such as frameworks, data and visualization types, application domains, narrative structures, outcome measurements, and design principles. It uses a mixed-method review approach, including the PRISMA guidelines, to select, classify, and summarize relevant papers from various domains including Behavioral science, HCI research, Marketing research, Data-Interaction research, and Communication Science. The review highlights the storytelling tradition's evolution to integrate with data visualization and discusses both the challenges of applying traditional storytelling to information visualization and the opportunities it creates for engaging audiences with complex global issues. The paper serves as a comprehensive guide that reviews the utilization of storytelling in visualizations and offers insights that are valuable for a broad range of audiences, including researchers and educators. It seeks to consolidate the diverse perspectives on storytelling within the context of data-driven narratives and examine the impact of these techniques on both cognitive and non-cognitive levels.\n",

      "Summary of The haptic paradigm in education: Challenges and case studies [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11943v1] by Felix G. Hamza-Lup, Ioana A. Stanescu:\n",
      "This paper discusses the enhancement of distance education by integrating haptic technology to simulate the sense of touch, thereby facilitating multimodal interactions including visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli. The paper first establishes the importance of involving various senses in the learning process and indicates how haptic technology has evolved with potentially significant impacts on cognitive and social presence within online learning environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "It outlines two approaches to deploying haptic applications: local and remote deployments, each with their implications for interaction and social presence. Furthermore, the paper provides a detailed examination of Multimodal Virtual Environments (MVEs) as tools for education, emphasizing the particular benefits for kinesthetic learners. The use of multiple sensory channels is posited to convey information more efficiently and create a richer communication channel, potentially leading to more effective teaching and learning experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper also reviews the characteristics of 21st-century students, highlighting their comfort with technology and the need for engaging educational strategies that cater to higher multimedia expectations and lower attention spans. It presents statistics to demonstrate the widespread use of technology in schools and among young people, indicating that the integration of interactive technologies in the curriculum could significantly enhance student engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the paper addresses the trends in internet technology and network architectures capable of accommodating varying levels of Quality-of-Service (QoS). This includes the implication that the introduction of haptic feedback in applications, as seen in the gaming industry, can dramatically improve user experience and drive market demand. The paper urges consideration of such advancements in the context of remote learning and training, and presents a case study that showcases the potential of haptic technology in education.\n",

       " 'TXT: Profiling: The First Step Towards Optimal Machine Learning Performance\\n\\nIn the realm of machine learning, optimal performance doesn\\'t solely hinge on advanced algorithms or large datasets – it often boils down to a deceptively old-school process: profiling. Profiling refers to the analysis of code to determine which sections consume the most resources, whether it\\'s processing time, memory, or data communications. By identifying common performance bottlenecks, profiling enables developers to target specific areas for optimization.\\n\\nFor machine learning applications, such bottlenecks might include inefficient data preprocessing, poorly optimized numerical computations, or suboptimal resource allocation during model training. These can cause significant slowdowns, particularly when scaling up to larger datasets or more complex neural network architectures.\\n\\nRecent studies have highlighted the critical role of profiling in enhancing machine learning performance. A survey by Sun et al. provides a comprehensive overview of optimization methods, which are essential for understanding where and how to optimize after profiling has identified potential issues. Additionally, the development of profiling tools specifically for machine learning workloads has become an area of focus. An example is the study \"Efficient Runtime Profiling for Black-box Machine Learning Services on Sensor Streams,\" where Becker et al. have demonstrated a black-box approach suitable for containerized machine learning applications, assembling multiple techniques to efficiently profile jobs without making assumptions about the underlying hardware or data streams (Becker et al., 2022).\\n\\nHigh-level optimization techniques, such as those described by Tavarageri et al. (2021), can exploit the multi-level cache hierarchy of CPUs, while low-level techniques deal with vectorizing code to run well on SIMD units of processors. This combination of high-level and low-level approaches ensures that machine learning code is not only efficient in its execution pattern but also precisely optimized for the hardware it runs on.\\n\\nIn addition, ongoing research indicates that profiling can lead to not just improvements in speed but also gains in AI safety and operational reliability. The study \"Learning Intermediate Representations using Graph Neural Networks for NUMA and Prefetchers Optimization\" by TehraniJamsaz et al. (2022) shows that a hybrid model using both static and dynamic profiling information can achieve significant performance improvements, which are crucial for ensuring the reliability of AI systems in real-world scenarios.\\n\\nIn practice, profiling can reveal that certain sections of code are inefficient because they make repetitive calls to slow operations or because they access memory in patterns that create bottlenecks. For example, matrix multiplication is a common operation in machine learning that, if not properly optimized, can drastically reduce performance. Techniques that specifically optimize such operations can lead to noticeable speed-ups. In deep learning workloads, these improvements are linked not only to model training time but also to energy consumption and hardware utilization – factors that are increasingly important as machine learning applications grow in scale.\\n\\nTo encapsulate, the integration of profiling into the machine learning development workflow serves as a critical measure towards optimal performance. It informs developers where they can make impactful changes, ensuring that the system is not only accurate but also efficiently uses resources. This balance of speed, accuracy, and resource management is the key to scalable, sustainable machine learning solutions.\\n\\nCitations:\\n1. \"A Survey of Optimization Methods from a Machine Learning Perspective\" by Shiliang Sun, Zehui Cao, Han Zhu, Jing Zhao. http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06821v2\\n2. \"Efficient Runtime Profiling for Black-box Machine Learning Services on Sensor Streams\" by Soeren Becker, Dominik Scheinert, Florian Schmidt, Odej Kao. http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05362v1\\n3. \"AI Powered Compiler Techniques for DL Code Optimization\" by Sanket Tavarageri, Gagandeep Goyal, Sasikanth Avancha, Bharat Kaul, Ramakrishna Upadrasta. http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05573v1\\n4. \"Learning Intermediate Representations using Graph Neural Networks for NUMA and Prefetchers Optimization\" by Ali TehraniJamsaz, Mihail Popov, Akash Dutta, Emmanuelle Saillard, Ali Jannesari. http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00611v1\\n\\nEND_TXT',\n",
       " 'TXT:\\n\\n**Metrics Matter: How to Gauge GPU Utilization Effectively**\\n\\nIn the fast-paced domain of machine learning, the need for robust performance metrics is non-negotiable. Researchers and engineers alike depend on well-defined metrics to measure the efficiency of their GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) utilization in order to optimize outcomes of machine learning models. GPU utilization directly impacts the speed and effectiveness of training deep learning algorithms and the inference times of trained models. Therefore, understanding and employing correct utilization metrics is critical for boosting operational efficiency.\\n\\nOne fundamental metric to monitor is **throughput**, which indicates how some workload is processed by the GPU over a period of time. Higher throughput can imply better GPU utilization, as it suggests that more data is being processed more swiftly. This concept has been demonstrated effectively in the domain of Function-as-a-Service for machine learning inference. Zhao, Jha, and Hong\\'s work on GPU-accelerated services shows that proper allocation of GPU resources for machine learning inference can significantly reduce latency, thus enhancing throughput (2023).\\n\\nAnother key metric is the **average job completion time**. Salus, for example, is a system that enables fine-grained GPU sharing with primitives like fast job switching and memory sharing. This approach improved the average completion time of DL training jobs by 3.19 times and fuelled a 42 times increase in GPU utilization for deep learning inference applications, compared to not sharing the GPU at all (Peifeng Yu et al., 2019). This demonstrates how techniques aimed at optimizing GPU scheduling can have a profound influence on overall machine learning performance.\\n\\nFurthermore, it\\'s important to consider **latency**, especially in a production environment where real-time inference is required. Spatial sharing of GPU for Autotuning DNN models, as reported by Dhakal, Cho, Kulkarni, Ramakrishnan, and Sharma, is notable for optimizing GPU utilization and, subsequently, reducing latency. By effectively multiplexing several DNNs on the same GPU resources, latency can be improved, and throughput is increased by a factor of 5 (2020).\\n\\nIt is also worth mentioning that a metric like **inference latency** is crucial for evaluating the practicability of deploying a tuned DNN model. As discovered in the same study, a model tuned with an appropriate amount of GPU resources achieves commendable inference latency across a broad range of GPU resource availability. This is a significant insight for applications requiring scalability and reliability in variable operating conditions.\\n\\nYet another metric to take into account is the efficiency of **dynamic resource allocation techniques**. MISO, for instance, can predict the optimal GPU partition allocation for different jobs without significant overhead. The result was a decrease in average job completion time by 49% compared to an unpartitioned scheme (Baolin Li et al., 2022). As AI applications become more multifaceted, the ability to dynamically allocate resources effectively becomes ever more critical for maintaining high levels of GPU utilization.\\n\\nGiven these metrics, it\\'s clear that understanding and improving GPU utilization shapes the bedrock of machine learning efficiency. The above studies and findings present compelling evidence that leveraging specific strategies like Salus\\' sharing primitives, spatial sharing, and dynamic resource allocation can deliver significant enhancements in performance metrics across a spectrum of machine learning operations.\\n\\n**Citations:**\\n1. \"GPU-enabled Function-as-a-Service for Machine Learning Inference,\" Ming Zhao, Kritshekhar Jha, Sungho Hong, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05601v1\\n2. \"Salus: Fine-Grained GPU Sharing Primitives for Deep Learning Applications,\" Peifeng Yu, Mosharaf Chowdhury, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04610v1\\n3. \"Spatial Sharing of GPU for Autotuning DNN models,\" Aditya Dhakal et al., http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03602v1\\n4. \"MISO: Exploiting Multi-Instance GPU Capability on Multi-Tenant Systems for Machine Learning,\" Baolin Li et al., http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11428v3\\n\\nEND_TXT',\n",

Let\\'s go ahead and adjust the content based on the correct references.\\n\\nRevised TXT:\\n\\nTrailblazing Progress in Machine Learning Code Optimization\\n\\nIn the world of machine learning (ML), code optimization is akin to a relentless quest for efficiency and speed—a task that has evolved considerably from the hand-tuned efforts of yesteryears to today’s breakthrough AI-driven methodologies. Historically, code optimization in ML was a craft mastered by specialists with an intricate understanding of both algorithm intricacies and hardware specifications. The early approaches required a granular level of control, often resulting in labor-intensive, manual tuning to achieve desired performance outcomes.\\n\\nFast forward to the present, and the landscape has undergone a seismic shift. Notably, the emergence of refined software frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch marked a transitional period towards automated optimizations, abstracting the complexity of code efficiency from machine learning developers and enabling a broader range of individuals to contribute to the field.\\n\\nYet, it is the advent of sophisticated learning-based methods that truly revolutionizes code optimization. A particularly influential work by Sun et al. (2019) delivers an exhaustive survey of various optimization techniques, accentuating their transformative impact on machine learning (Sun et al., 2019). Machine learning not only reshapes existing optimization methods but is also used to directly enhance compiler efficiency.\\n\\nBuilding on these advancements, recent research has seen the rise of groundbreaking technologies that make optimization processes more cost-effective without sacrificing performance. TehraniJamsaz et al. (2022) explore this promising domain, unveiling hybrid models that integrate static and dynamic data to reduce the overhead of performance profiling, bringing a new level of efficiency to optimization practices (TehraniJamsaz et al., 2022).\\n\\nThe current trajectory points towards a future where AI not only powers the development of machine learning models but also curates the environment they operate within. Ensuring the AI systems we deploy are both high-performing and cost-effective, machine learning code optimization stands as a bedrock of reliable and sustainable AI solutions.\\n\\nReflecting upon the range of literature in machine learning and AI optimization, one can perceive an academic and industry-wide collaboration dedicated to refining the operational backbone of these technologies. Without a comprehensive knowledge graph available for reference, this collaborative ethos can still be gleaned from a multitude of papers, interactions, and implementations that push the boundaries of what is possible in code optimization. As such, the convergence of machine learning and code optimization continues to unfold, with researchers and practitioners forging new paths toward innovation and efficiency.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n- Shiliang Sun, Zehui Cao, Han Zhu, & Jing Zhao. \"A Survey of Optimization Methods from a Machine Learning Perspective.\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06821v2\\n- Ali TehraniJamsaz, Mihail Popov, Akash Dutta, Emmanuelle Saillard, & Ali Jannesari. \"Learning Intermediate Representations using Graph Neural Networks for NUMA and Prefetchers Optimization.\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00611v1\\n\\nEND_TXT\\n\\nWith the revised content excluding the reference to the LPWC knowledge graph paper, we\\'ve corrected the inaccuracies and upheld the standards of our editorial process.',\n",
       " 'TXT:\\n\\nEnsuring AI Safety and Reliability Through Optimization\\n\\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in our daily lives, their safety and reliability are paramount concerns, particularly in high-stakes environments like autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance. Optimization strategies play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety, by ensuring that these systems can handle real-world variability and uncertainties with grace.\\n\\nA key strategy in optimization for safety is the implementation of inherent diverse redundant safety mechanisms, especially in AI-based software elements (Pitale, Abbaspour, Upadhyay). For instance, in autonomous driving systems, AI algorithms are responsible for critical tasks like perception, decision-making, and emergency responses. Given the unpredictability of road conditions, it is vital that these AI models have the ability to generalize beyond their initial training data while avoiding overconfidence in their decisions. By promoting certainty reporting architectures and diverse training data sets, the AI systems can maintain performance without compromising safety.\\n\\nAdopting a comprehensive safety framework is another optimization strategy for AI systems. For example, Chai\\'s AI safety principles—content safeguarding, stability and robustness, operational transparency, and traceability—demonstrate how multidimensional safety research can be integrated into AI platforms (Lu, Korshuk, Liu, Beauchamp). These frameworks help in mitigating potential risks and promoting responsible and ethical use of AI, which are vital for user safety and trust in AI systems.\\n\\nAdditionally, a taxonomy for AI system evaluation can help streamline safety assessments by providing harmonized terminology and identifying essential evaluation elements (Xia, Lu, Zhu, Xing). This taxonomy enables a clear mapping between the AI lifecycle, stakeholders, and required evaluations, ensuring a more accountable AI supply chain.\\n\\nSeveral other aspects of AI optimization are noteworthy, such as the use of NeuroSymbolic AI systems, which bring together statistical and symbolic AI methods. The CREST framework developed by Gaur and Sheth focuses on consistency, reliability, explainability, and safety, offering a structured approach that can enhance trust in AI systems. However, while creating trust through safety is necessary, it is not enough on its own. AI safety must also encompass socio-technical and emergent system properties, an understanding advocated by Dobbe through the insights from the field of system safety for software-based automation in safety-critical domains.\\n\\nIn essence, optimizing AI for safety involves a multi-layered approach that includes technical design, risk management considering the human-AI interaction (Saberi), and the socio-technical landscape as a whole. Such an approach must be both inclusive and robust, taking into account the many facets of AI deployment in real-world scenarios.\\n\\nCitations:\\n- \"Inherent Diverse Redundant Safety Mechanisms for AI-based Software Elements in Automotive Applications,\" Mandar Pitale, Alireza Abbaspour, Devesh Upadhyay, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08208v2.\\n- \"The Chai Platform\\'s AI Safety Framework,\" Xiaoding Lu, Aleksey Korshuk, Zongyi Liu, William Beauchamp, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02979v1.\\n- \"Towards AI Safety: A Taxonomy for AI System Evaluation,\" Boming Xia, Qinghua Lu, Liming Zhu, Zhenchang Xing, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05388v1.\\n- \"Building Trustworthy NeuroSymbolic AI Systems: Consistency, Reliability, Explainability, and Safety,\" Manas Gaur, Amit Sheth, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06798v1.\\n- \"System Safety and Artificial Intelligence,\" Roel I.

Using a confluence of techniques to adaptively adjust resources, their method captured the general runtime behavior of machine learning jobs swiftly and accurately, emphasizing the importance of responsive and adaptive optimization in real-time AI safety.\\n\\nAs AI systems grow more complex and integral to our daily lives, the disciplines of profiling and optimization are not merely about performance—they embody the stewardship of trust and reliability in technology.\\n\\n## 2.  Profiling: The First Step Towards Optimal Machine Learning Performance\\n\\nIn the realm of machine learning, optimal performance doesn\\'t solely hinge on advanced algorithms or large datasets – it often boils down to a deceptively old-school process: profiling. Profiling refers to the analysis of code to determine which sections consume the most resources, whether it\\'s processing time, memory, or data communications. By identifying common performance bottlenecks, profiling enables developers to target specific areas for optimization.\\n\\nFor machine learning applications, such bottlenecks might include inefficient data preprocessing, poorly optimized numerical computations, or suboptimal resource allocation during model training. These can cause significant slowdowns, particularly when scaling up to larger datasets or more complex neural network architectures.\\n\\nRecent studies have highlighted the critical role of profiling in enhancing machine learning performance. A survey by Sun et al. provides a comprehensive overview of optimization methods, which are essential for understanding where and how to optimize after profiling has identified potential issues. Additionally, the development of profiling tools specifically for machine learning workloads has become an area of focus. An example is the study \"Efficient Runtime Profiling for Black-box Machine Learning Services on Sensor Streams,\" where Becker et al. have demonstrated a black-box approach suitable for containerized machine learning applications, assembling multiple techniques to efficiently profile jobs without making assumptions about the underlying hardware or data streams (Becker et al., 2022).\\n\\nHigh-level optimization techniques, such as those described by Tavarageri et al. (2021), can exploit the multi-level cache hierarchy of CPUs, while low-level techniques deal with vectorizing code to run well on SIMD units of processors. This combination of high-level and low-level approaches ensures that machine learning code is not only efficient in its execution pattern but also precisely optimized for the hardware it runs on.\\n\\nIn addition, ongoing research indicates that profiling can lead to not just improvements in speed but also gains in AI safety and operational reliability. The study \"Learning Intermediate Representations using Graph Neural Networks for NUMA and Prefetchers Optimization\" by TehraniJamsaz et al. (2022) shows that a hybrid model using both static and dynamic profiling information can achieve significant performance improvements, which are crucial for ensuring the reliability of AI systems in real-world scenarios.\\n\\nIn practice, profiling can reveal that certain sections of code are inefficient because they make repetitive calls to slow operations or because they access memory in patterns that create bottlenecks. For example, matrix multiplication is a common operation in machine learning that, if not properly optimized, can drastically reduce performance. Techniques that specifically optimize such operations can lead to noticeable speed-ups. In deep learning workloads, these improvements are linked not only to model training time but also to energy consumption and hardware utilization – factors that are increasingly important as machine learning applications grow in scale.\\n\\nTo encapsulate, the integration of profiling into the machine learning development workflow serves as a critical measure towards optimal performance. It informs developers where they can make impactful changes, ensuring that the system is not only accurate but also efficiently uses resources. This balance of speed, accuracy, and resource management is the key to scalable, sustainable machine learning solutions.\\n\\n## 3. \\n\\n**Metrics Matter: How to Gauge GPU Utilization Effectively**\\n\\nIn the fast-paced domain of machine learning, the need for robust performance metrics is non-negotiable. Researchers and engineers alike depend on well-defined metrics to measure the efficiency of their GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) utilization in order to optimize outcomes of machine learning models. GPU utilization directly impacts the speed and effectiveness of training deep learning algorithms and the inference times of trained models. Therefore, understanding and employing correct utilization metrics is critical for boosting operational efficiency.\\n\\nOne fundamental metric to monitor is **throughput**, which indicates how some workload is processed by the GPU over a period of time. Higher throughput can imply better GPU utilization, as it suggests that more data is being processed more swiftly. This concept has been demonstrated effectively in the domain of Function-as-a-Service for machine learning inference. Zhao, Jha, and Hong\\'s work on GPU-accelerated services shows that proper allocation of GPU resources for machine learning inference can significantly reduce latency, thus enhancing throughput (2023).\\n\\nAnother key metric is the **average job completion time**. Salus, for example, is a system that enables fine-grained GPU sharing with primitives like fast job switching and memory sharing. This approach improved the average completion time of DL training jobs by 3.19 times and fuelled a 42 times increase in GPU utilization for deep learning inference applications, compared to not sharing the GPU at all (Peifeng Yu et al., 2019). This demonstrates how techniques aimed at optimizing GPU scheduling can have a profound influence on overall machine learning performance.\\n\\nFurthermore, it\\'s important to consider **latency**, especially in a production environment where real-time inference is required. Spatial sharing of GPU for Autotuning DNN models, as reported by Dhakal, Cho, Kulkarni, Ramakrishnan, and Sharma, is notable for optimizing GPU utilization and, subsequently, reducing latency. By effectively multiplexing several DNNs on the same GPU resources, latency can be improved, and throughput is increased by a factor of 5 (2020).\\n\\nIt is also worth mentioning that a metric like **inference latency** is crucial for evaluating the practicability of deploying a tuned DNN model. As discovered in the same study, a model tuned with an appropriate amount of GPU resources achieves commendable inference latency across a broad range of GPU resource availability. This is a significant insight for applications requiring scalability and reliability in variable operating conditions.\\n\\nYet another metric to take into account is the efficiency of **dynamic resource allocation techniques**. MISO, for instance, can predict the optimal GPU partition allocation for different jobs without significant overhead. The result was a decrease in average job completion time by 49% compared to an unpartitioned scheme (Baolin Li et al., 2022). As AI applications become more multifaceted, the ability to dynamically allocate resources effectively becomes ever more critical for maintaining high levels of GPU utilization.\\n\\nGiven these metrics, it\\'s clear that understanding and improving GPU utilization shapes the bedrock of machine learning efficiency. The above studies and findings present compelling evidence that leveraging specific strategies like Salus\\' sharing primitives, spatial sharing, and dynamic resource allocation can deliver significant enhancements in performance metrics across a spectrum of machine learning operations.\\n\\n**\\n\\n## 4. Given the guidelines and feedback, I\\'ll proceed to revise the section by omitting the reference to the LPWC knowledge graph paper by Färber & Lamprecht due to its unavailability and to ensure that the blog post content maintains its integrity and accuracy. Let\\'s go ahead and adjust the content based on the correct references.\\n\\nRevised \\n\\nTrailblazing Progress in Machine Learning Code Optimization\\n\\nIn the world of machine learning (ML), code optimization is akin to a relentless quest for efficiency and speed—a task that has evolved considerably from the hand-tuned efforts of yesteryears to today’s breakthrough AI-driven methodologies. Historically, code optimization in ML was a craft mastered by specialists with an intricate understanding of both algorithm intricacies and hardware specifications. The early approaches required a granular level of control, often resulting in labor-intensive, manual tuning to achieve desired performance outcomes.\\n\\nFast forward to the present, and the landscape has undergone a seismic shift. Notably, the emergence of refined software frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch marked a transitional period towards automated optimizations, abstracting the complexity of code efficiency from machine learning developers and enabling a broader range of individuals to contribute to the field.\\n\\nYet, it is the advent of sophisticated learning-based methods that truly revolutionizes code optimization. A particularly influential work by Sun et al. (2019) delivers an exhaustive survey of various optimization techniques, accentuating their transformative impact on machine learning (Sun et al., 2019). Machine learning not only reshapes existing optimization methods but is also used to directly enhance compiler efficiency.\\n\\nBuilding on these advancements, recent research has seen the rise of groundbreaking technologies that make optimization processes more cost-effective without sacrificing performance. TehraniJamsaz et al. (2022) explore this promising domain, unveiling hybrid models that integrate static and dynamic data to reduce the overhead of performance profiling, bringing a new level of efficiency to optimization practices (TehraniJamsaz et al., 2022).\\n\\nThe current trajectory points towards a future where AI not only powers the development of machine learning models but also curates the environment they operate within. Ensuring the AI systems we deploy are both high-performing and cost-effective, machine learning code optimization stands as a bedrock of reliable and sustainable AI solutions.\\n\\nReflecting upon the range of literature in machine learning and AI optimization, one can perceive an academic and industry-wide collaboration dedicated to refining the operational backbone of these technologies. Without a comprehensive knowledge graph available for reference, this collaborative ethos can still be gleaned from a multitude of papers, interactions, and implementations that push the boundaries of what is possible in code optimization. As such, the convergence of machine learning and code optimization continues to unfold, with researchers and practitioners forging new paths toward innovation and efficiency.\\n\\n## 5. \\n\\nEnsuring AI Safety and Reliability Through Optimization\\n\\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in our daily lives, their safety and reliability are paramount concerns, particularly in high-stakes environments like autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance. Optimization strategies play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety, by ensuring that these systems can handle real-world variability and uncertainties with grace.\\n\\nA key strategy in optimization for safety is the implementation of inherent diverse redundant safety mechanisms, especially in AI-based software elements (Pitale, Abbaspour, Upadhyay). For instance, in autonomous driving systems, AI algorithms are responsible for critical tasks like perception, decision-making, and emergency responses. Given the unpredictability of road conditions, it is vital that these AI models have the ability to generalize beyond their initial training data while avoiding overconfidence in their decisions. By promoting certainty reporting architectures and diverse training data sets, the AI systems can maintain performance without compromising safety.\\n\\nAdopting a comprehensive safety framework is another optimization strategy for AI systems. For example, Chai\\'s AI safety principles—content safeguarding, stability and robustness, operational transparency, and traceability—demonstrate how multidimensional safety research can be integrated into AI platforms (Lu, Korshuk, Liu, Beauchamp). These frameworks help in mitigating potential risks and promoting responsible and ethical use of AI, which are vital for user safety and trust in AI systems.\\n\\nAdditionally, a taxonomy for AI system evaluation can help streamline safety assessments by providing harmonized terminology and identifying essential evaluation elements (Xia, Lu, Zhu, Xing). This taxonomy enables a clear mapping between the AI lifecycle, stakeholders, and required evaluations, ensuring a more accountable AI supply chain.\\n\\nSeveral other aspects of AI optimization are noteworthy, such as the use of NeuroSymbolic AI systems, which bring together statistical and symbolic AI methods. The CREST framework developed by Gaur and Sheth focuses on consistency, reliability, explainability, and safety, offering a structured approach that can enhance trust in AI systems. However, while creating trust through safety is necessary, it is not enough on its own. AI safety must also encompass socio-technical and emergent system properties, an understanding advocated by Dobbe through the insights from the field of system safety for software-based automation in safety-critical domains.\\n\\nIn essence, optimizing AI for safety involves a multi-layered approach that includes technical design, risk management considering the human-AI interaction (Saberi), and the socio-technical landscape as a whole. Such an approach must be both inclusive and robust, taking into account the many facets of AI deployment in real-world scenarios.\\n\\n## 6.

Hamza-Lup, Ioana A. Stanescu (2018). \"The haptic paradigm in education: Challenges and case studies\". [The haptic paradigm in education](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11943v1)\\n\\nThe text of the blog can be revised to integrate these references:\\n\\n\\nIn bridging the gap between complex technical data and the public, several effective strategies have emerged. One of these strategies is participatory data visualization, an approach that involves audiences in the creation process to foster understanding. An example is found in \"Participatory Design for Mental Health Data Visualization on a Social Robot,\" where the involvement of end-users in the design process enabled more effective communication of complex mental health data (Karim et al., 2022).\\n\\nThe practice of storytelling with data is another essential technique for simplifying complex information. A systematic review titled \"Telling stories with data -- A systematic review\" provides a comprehensive assessment of how narrative techniques, combined with data visualization, can enhance comprehension and retention of complex information (Schröder et al., 2023).\\n\\nWhen it comes to machine learning, methods for clarifying its concepts to the public are crucial. The paper \"Transparency challenges in policy evaluation with causal machine learning -- improving usability and accountability\" explores the intersection of machine learning and public policy, emphasizing the importance of transparency for public understanding (Rehill & Biddle, 2023).\\n\\nAdditionally, interactive simulations have proven to be powerful in education. \"The haptic paradigm in education: Challenges and case studies\" explores the use of tactile and interactive simulations to facilitate learning, particularly in conveying abstract scientific concepts (Hamza-Lup & Stanescu, 2018).\\n\\n## 7. \\n\\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) permeates more areas of our lives, safety and performance optimization are becoming paramount. Researchers are delving into pressing challenges in AI safety, questioning how these systems can operate safely in unpredictable environments and examining the legal and ethical ramifications of AI applications.\\n\\nA primary concern outlined in the paper \\'Inherent Diverse Redundant Safety Mechanisms for AI-based Software Elements in Automotive Applications\\' is the reliance of AI systems on training data and their subsequent struggle in situations unaccounted for in their datasets (Pitale et al., 2024). This is especially critical in autonomous driving, where AI must make split-second decisions with potentially life-threatening consequences. The research highlights the need for AI models to generalize effectively and function efficiently in the face of these domain shifts.\\n\\nTurning to the legal and ethical aspects, \\'The Human Factor in AI Safety\\' by Morteza Saberi (2022) underscores the complications arising from human interaction with AI systems. As these systems assume roles in decision-making, risks such as ethical dilemmas, biased outcomes, and safety hazards surface. It\\'s imperative to consider not only the algorithms\\' safety but also the end-users\\' decision-making archetypes to ensure comprehensive risk management. \\n\\nLegal and ethical considerations deeply impact AI performance optimization and safety measures. Dobbe (2022) articulates that AI safety cannot be achieved solely through technical solutions. A broader view that encompasses the technical, social, and institutional components within the system\\'s operational environment is required. This indicates the need for a transdisciplinary approach involving diverse stakeholders to create AI systems that are inherently safe and aligned with societal values.\\n\\nIn the pursuit of optimization, \\'The Chai Platform\\'s AI Safety Framework\\' demonstrates how AI safety can be operationalized (Lu et al., 2023). By implementing a framework of content safeguarding, stability and robustness, alongside operational transparency and traceability, Chai shows how AI can progress responsibly. The application of safety principles in real-world platforms like Chai reveals that ethical use and user safety are integral to optimization.\\n\\nFinally, to help standardize safety evaluations, a paper titled \\'Towards AI Safety: A Taxonomy for AI System Evaluation\\' suggests a structured approach (Xia et al., 2024). The framework it proposes includes harmonized terminology and a mapping between the AI lifecycle, stakeholders, and required evaluations. This facilitates clear communication and sets criteria for judging AI systems’ safety.\\n\\nThe intersection of AI safety and performance optimization is a dynamic field. Addressing these challenges involves not only increasing the robustness of algorithms but also navigating the complex landscape of outcomes influenced by human interaction, legal policies, and ethical responsibilities. Research continues to evolve, proposing comprehensive strategies to mitigate risks while striving for enhanced safety in AI applications.\\n\\nCitations: \\n- Ali TehraniJamsaz, Mihail Popov, Akash Dutta, Emmanuelle Saillard, Ali Jannesari. \"Learning Intermediate Representations using Graph Neural Networks for NUMA and Prefetchers Optimization.\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00611v1\\n- Sanket Tavarageri, Gagandeep Goyal, Sasikanth Avancha, Bharat Kaul, Ramakrishna Upadrasta. \"AI Powered Compiler Techniques for DL Code Optimization.\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05573v1\\n- Soeren Becker, Dominik Scheinert, Florian Schmidt, Odej Kao. \"Efficient Runtime Profiling for Black-box Machine Learning Services on Sensor Streams.\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05362v1\\n- Shiliang Sun, Zehui Cao, Han Zhu, Jing Zhao. \"A Survey of Optimization Methods from a Machine Learning Perspective.\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06821v2\\n\\n\\n1. \"A Survey of Optimization Methods from a Machine Learning Perspective\" by Shiliang Sun, Zehui Cao, Han Zhu, Jing Zhao. http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06821v2\\n2. \"Efficient Runtime Profiling for Black-box Machine Learning Services on Sensor Streams\" by Soeren Becker, Dominik Scheinert, Florian Schmidt, Odej Kao. http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05362v1\\n3. \"AI Powered Compiler Techniques for DL Code Optimization\" by Sanket Tavarageri, Gagandeep Goyal, Sasikanth Avancha, Bharat Kaul, Ramakrishna Upadrasta. http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05573v1\\n4. \"Learning Intermediate Representations using Graph Neural Networks for NUMA and Prefetchers Optimization\" by Ali TehraniJamsaz, Mihail Popov, Akash Dutta, Emmanuelle Saillard, Ali Jannesari. http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00611v1\\n\\n\\n**\\n1. \"GPU-enabled Function-as-a-Service for Machine Learning Inference,\" Ming Zhao, Kritshekhar Jha, Sungho Hong, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05601v1\\n2. \"Salus: Fine-Grained GPU Sharing Primitives for Deep Learning Applications,\" Peifeng Yu, Mosharaf Chowdhury, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04610v1\\n3. \"Spatial Sharing of GPU for Autotuning DNN models,\" Aditya Dhakal et al., http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03602v1\\n4. \"MISO: Exploiting Multi-Instance GPU Capability on Multi-Tenant Systems for Machine Learning,\" Baolin Li et al., http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11428v3\\n\\n\\n- Shiliang Sun, Zehui Cao, Han Zhu, & Jing Zhao. \"A Survey of Optimization Methods from a Machine Learning Perspective.\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06821v2\\n- Ali TehraniJamsaz, Mihail Popov, Akash Dutta, Emmanuelle Saillard, & Ali Jannesari. \"Learning Intermediate Representations using Graph Neural Networks for NUMA and Prefetchers Optimization.\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00611v1\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the revised content excluding the reference to the LPWC knowledge graph paper, we\\'ve corrected the inaccuracies and upheld the standards of our editorial process.\\n- \"Inherent Diverse Redundant Safety Mechanisms for AI-based Software Elements in Automotive Applications,\" Mandar Pitale, Alireza Abbaspour, Devesh Upadhyay, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08208v2.\\n- \"The Chai Platform\\'s AI Safety Framework,\" Xiaoding Lu, Aleksey Korshuk, Zongyi Liu, William Beauchamp, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02979v1.\\n- \"Towards AI Safety: A Taxonomy for AI System Evaluation,\" Boming Xia, Qinghua Lu, Liming Zhu, Zhenchang Xing, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05388v1.\\n- \"Building Trustworthy NeuroSymbolic AI Systems: Consistency, Reliability, Explainability, and Safety,\" Manas Gaur, Amit Sheth, http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06798v1.\\n- \"System Safety and Artificial Intelligence,\" Roel I.
