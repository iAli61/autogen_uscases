Polymer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to exploit existing polymer data for efficient design of functional polymers.

We hope that this paper can serve as an entry point for researchers interested in the field of polymer informatics.\\n\\nPolymers are one of the most important classes of material in modern society, as its applica- tions range from the plastic bags and bottles used in daily life to a variety of electronics, and even structural components in the aerospace industry. A polymer is a material made of a col- lection of chains that are built by connecting many repeated units, called monomers. These chains can form diverse structures that contribute to the highly diverse physical and chemi- cal properties of different types of polymers. Some polymers can be consisting of more than one type of monomer to form even more complicated topological structures across different length scales. The research field of polymer science and engineering emerged to understand, control, and design novel polymers that can be used to satisfy the rapidly growing demand on highly functional materials coming from different aspects of modern life. While polymers can be categorized into natural or synthetic polymers, we will focus our discussion on the latter in this paper.\\n\\nFollowing the mainstream of materials science, polymer science has gone through mul- tiple major paradigm shifts. The early studies of polymers flourished in the first half of the 20th century was closely associated with H. Staudinger who received the Nobel Prize in 1953.1 Initially, discovery of polymers was mainly based on an empirical approach, i.e., relying on many trial-and-error experiments. Accumulation of experimental experiences has led to developments of theoretical and simple statistical models for guiding the design of new\\n\\n2\\n\\npolymers. These include many important work by the 1974 Nobel prize recipient P. J. Flory, the group contribution method and so on.2-4 Following the rapid advances of computing power in the last few decades, computational methods has become one of the main tools to study properties of polymers.5 Recent developments of simulation techniques for vari- ous types of polymers opened up opportunities to computationally study polymers across different length scales. 6,7 While generating experimental data of polymers is often costly and time-consuming, modern supercomputers provide new opportunities for building larger databases of polymers computationally. With the drastic expansion of data size in science, a data-driven approach for scientific discovery is said to be the 4th paradigm of science. Poly- mer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to mine the precious polymer data for new knowledge. Yet, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics attributed to the complex hierarchical structures of polymers. 8,9\\n\\nDesign of a polymer can be broken down into three parts corresponding to the three steps in the typical production process of polymers: design of monomers (polymerization), microstructures (crystallization), and material processing (manufacturing) (see Figure 1). Monomers, the building blocks of polymers, contribute to the foundation of potential prop- erties of the eventually produced polymers. While molecular size is one of the important factors that influences the properties of an organic material, the \"size effect\" of polymers is not directly correlated with the size of the monomers because a large collection of small monomers (e.g., ethylene) can also build long polymer chains the same way large monomers do. Instead, various metrics based on the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of a poly- mer are often used as a reference to relate the \"size of polymer\" to polymer properties. Different polymers built from the same monomer can have different MWD by controlling the polymerization process, which can lead to significantly different physical and chemical properties. 10-12 Furthermore, the collection of polymer chains can form very different crystal structures through a variety of crystallization processes, affecting the material properties of\\n\\n3\\n\\nthe resulting polymers. For example, Yi et al. controlled the crystallinity and orientation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) molecules to optimize the performance of solar cells. 13 Finally, the same type of polymer in the microscopic scale can undergo different manufacturing pro- cess, such as stretching or mixing additives, to further enhance or alter its properties in order to fulfil specific needs from a broad range of applications. 14 Ideally, the design space of polymers covers all parameters involved in the three production steps, for example, the molecule space of a single or multiple monomer(s) (namely homopolymers or copolymers, respectively), temperature and types of polymerization process, additives or fillers, molding methods, etc. In practice, we often focus on a subset of the parameters while keeping other fixed to reduce the enormous search space. For example, Wu et al. focused on the design of monomer that has a high probability of making liquid crystal polymers with high thermal conductivity after compressed to a polymer thin film. 15\\n\\nHomopolymer\\n\\nMolecular Weight Distribution\\n\\nAlternating copolymer\\n\\nRandom copolymer\\n\\nIsotactic polymer\\n\\nBlock copolymer\\n\\nSyndiotactic polymer\\n\\nGraft copolymer\\n\\nAtactic polymer\\n\\nPolymerization\\n\\nTopological diversity\\n\\nLine\\n\\nBranched\\n\\nStar\\n\\nNetwork\\n\\nCrystallization\\n\\nMonomer\\n\\nPolymer\\n\\nCrystallinity\\n\\n,Crystal region\\n\\nAmorphous region\\n\\nLiquid crystalline\\n\\nNematic Smectic\\n\\nManufacturing\\n\\nMicrostructures\\n\\nHierarchical structures of polymers\\n\\nMicrophase separation\\n\\nSphere\\n\\nCylinder\\n\\nGyroid\\n\\nLamella\\n\\n-\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\n+\\n\\nnm\\n\\npm\\n\\num\\n\\nmm\\n\\nLength\\n\\nscale\\n\\nm\\n\\nFigure 1: Overview of polymer design across different length scales.\\n\\nA machine learning approach of polymers design on such a large design space requires a\\n\\n4\\n\\nvery large data set, in terms of both quantity and diversity. Unfortunately, openly available large polymer database is still limited8 and historical data is often highly biased to a few types of polymers or polymer properties. For example, in PoLyInfo, 16,17 which is one of the largest database of polymers, around 30% of data related to thermal properties are covered by only 10 different polymers and over 40% of data is glass transition temperature (see Figure 2). In order to achieve a fully data-driven process of polymer design, continuous efforts have been made to bridge the demand of machine learning technologies and the current state of polymer informatics. In this paper, we review and discuss the applications of machine learning on different aspects of the polymer design process through four perspectives: polymer databases, representation (descriptor) of polymers, predictive models for polymer properties, and polymer design strategy. Illustrative examples are also given using the open- source materials informatics software, XenonPy.18 We hope that this paper can serve as an entry point for researchers interested in the field of polymer informatics, who may be coming from any of the scientific fields covered by polymer informatics.\\n\\n## Machine learning in polymer informatics\\n\\nThe goal of machine learning is to develop computer algorithms that can automatically improve their ability to solve a target problem by extracting information from past experience (training data). A basic implementation of this idea is to build a mapping f from an input x to an output y when given some relevant data D. Here, x is the representation (or descriptor) of a problem of interest, which we will discuss in detail in the next section. Depending on the choice of f, y and D, machine learning is often categorized into:\\n\\n· Supervised learning Directly building f that maps x to the desired output of interest y by learning from many examples of pairings between different x and y in D. Such data that contains pairs of x and y is called labelled data. Supervised machine learning is often subcategorized into regression or classification, where y is\\n\\n5\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n3500\\n\\nNumber of data\\n\\n3000\\n\\n2500\\n\\n2000\\n\\norder.\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n25000 20000\\n\\nNumber of data\\n\\n15000\\n\\n1500\\n\\n1000\\n\\n500\\n\\n0\\n\\n+ Polyethylene\\n\\nPolystyrene\\n\\n10000\\n\\n5000\\n\\n0 Glass trangtion temperature\\n\\ng temperature Thermal decomposition temp. temperature Thermal decompositions Volume Tensile stress (streng hij\\n\\n+ Poly(ethylene oxide) + Poly(vinyl chloride)\\n\\nCrystalleandro Msc\\n\\naty! tune\\n\\nSpecific heat -constant ly\\n\\nThermal expansion vores (streng Pressure Thermal expansion shear espanso coefficient\\n\\nmeexpansion conelg\\n\\nCreation\\n\\nDynamic terieis atemperatura\\n\\nDynamic tensiegem\\n\\nThermang\\n\\n#: Nucle ation parameterma\\n\\nDynamic teri Us to fus Isothermat wt.formodo\\n\\nThermal diffusivity Specific heat (constant pressure) Glass transition temperature\\n\\nElcamper\\n\\nPVT: Sper de jure\\n\\nPVP volume\\n\\n* Growth rate parametru module\\n\\nShor Vremea\\n\\nLogs Panfu\\n\\nshear: Loss moules Defection temp under load (HO) Dynamic she a: Bile modules Fiber tensile el Dy nia mic flexur\\n\\nFigure 2: Statistics of 54151 data entries of 83 different polymer properties related to thermal properties recorded in PoLyInfo (extracted on April 2016).

An example would be building a model to predict the glass transition temperature of homopolymers (y) from composition and bonding information of the corresponding monomers (x). 19,20\\n\\n· Unsupervised learning Learning the underlying structure of x using unlabelled data, i.e., D has no information about the output of interest y. Typical techniques of unsupervised machine learning are clustering and dimension reduction, where x is mapped to some categorical labels or lower dimensional space, respectively. For example, Xu et al. used these techniques to study phase transitions of polymer config- urations. 21 Note that the learned mapping is not necessarily directly correlated with the targeted y as such information is not included in D.\\n\\n· Reinforcement learning Learning a strategy to achieve a certain goal in an interactive environment. Closely related to the problem of experimental design, the goal here is to learn f that maps the current state x to a possible action y. Successful training of f through repeated engagement to the system can take the system closer to the final goal. Typically, a reward function is defined to quantify the progress of the system and the size of D increases continuously during the interactive engagement process. An example would be developing optimal strategy to control MWD of a class of polymers. 22\\n\\nDepending on the nature of application, available data and computing resources, it is important for researchers to frame their problems under an appropriate class of machine learning, to pick a suitable learning algorithm, and to represent the materials of interest using an effective descriptor. We attempt to provide useful hints from existing literature and our own experience in the following sections.\\n\\n7\\n\\n## Database\\n\\nOne of the most important components in machine learning is data. The quality and quantity of available data determine the scope of solvable problems in an application. A rule of thumb in machine learning is that purely data-driven models are not reliable when extrapolating. In other words, it is dangerous to trust the prediction of a model on a material that is not similar to the ones in the training data. Therefore, high quality large database for a diverse set of polymers is always of high demand in polymer informatics. Table 1 shows a list of online databases that contain polymer data. There also exists large amount of publications on polymer technology or database that collects recipes of polymer synthesis (e.g., NIST Synthetic Polymer MALDI Recipes Database23). These types of information require extra processing effort before being useful for polymer informatics.\\n\\nComparing to other research fields (e.g., image recognition) that benefit from modern ma- chine learning technology, deep learning specifically, the number and size of open databases in polymer informatics are significantly smaller. We have accumulated a large amount of polymer data throughout the history of polymer science, but many historical data recorded in handbooks or publications are not well-organized, and a lot of the industry-owned data are not openly available. These issues have become the bottleneck for the development of polymer informatics.8 With the advancements of computational simulation technologies and supercomputers, we expect an increasing interest and opportunity to build large scale com- putational databases of polymers. Meanwhile, technology of high-throughput experiments 28 and the use of robotics combined with artificial intelligence29 provide new opportunities to build experimental database of polymers efficiently. Making these databases open for research purposes will be the key to the success of polymer informatics.\\n\\n8\\n\\nTable 1: List of online polymer databases.

This is particularly difficult for polymers due to their hierarchical structures. 30 An example of unique representation of polymers would be the Polymer Markup Language, which is designed to include complete information of a polymer ranging from compositional information to all the processing pa- rameters.31 While this representation may be suitable for building polymer databases, it is not compact enough to be used as input of a model for machine learning purposes. In fact, a good material descriptor should consider the tradeoff between ability to uniquely represent a material, easiness to obtain or calculate, and sensitivity to targeted application. 32 In other words, while possible, it is unlikely that a single descriptor can be used for all polymer ap- plications. For example, to search for an efficient polyimide for controlled inkjet deposition, descriptor needs to be sensitive to specific microstructures formed by the polymer chains. 33 On the other hand, designing polymers with certain phase transition properties will require a descriptor that identifies key atomic-level structures. Different level of \"fineness\" of de- scriptor should be selected depending on the physical and chemical properties of interest to the target problem. 34 One example that attempted to capture such hierarchy of descriptor in a Python package is the Materials knowledge systems. 35 Here, we introduce and compare a few descriptors that could be useful in polymer informatics.\\n\\nProcessing conditions of polymers, such as temperature, additives and solvents, can be directly included in a descriptor. Representations of the microstructure and molecular struc- ture of polymer chains are less intuitive. Certain machine learning models in deep learning allow direct use of images as input, but often require a significant amount of data to train the models. 36 Persistant homology is a technique to extract statistical features from topo- logical structures, 37 but its application in polymer informatics is yet to be investigated. Graphical kernel is another option to numerically encode the polymer structures that can be represented in a simple graph. 38 However, finding an efficient graph representation for\\n\\n10\\n\\nthe complex polymer structures is challenging, especially because different types of polymer chains can form structures in different length scales. Many of the descriptors commonly used in polymer informatics focus on capturing the molecular structure of monomers composing the polymer chains.\\n\\nMaterial descriptors or fingerprints developed for small organic molecules are directly applicable to represent polymers based on their monomers. Modern machine learning al- gorithms also allow direct use of molecular graph or simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) 39 strings as input of a model. 40 Picking a descriptor suitable for the prob- lem of interest may significantly improves the efficiency of machine learning. 34 However, such representation omits information about the chemical bonds between the monomers. An al- ternative is to consider oligmer consisting of n monomers, but there is no clear answer to how to pick n. The larger n is, the more representative the oligmer would be to the polymer. Nevertheless, certain types of descriptors, such as the physical descriptors, will take signifi- cantly longer time to calculate for a larger molecule. Furthermore, some fingerprints could be biased toward polymers with smaller or larger monomers depending on the choice of n. For example, a fingerprint that counts if there are more than 3 benzene rings in a molecule will not be able to distinguish between polystyrene and poly(bisphenol A carbonate) when n > 3. Figure 3 shows how different fingerprints may have different convergence behavior with respect to n. Wu et al. proposed to calculate descriptor of polymers using an infinitely long chain of their corresponding monomers. 19 However, the bias issue for some fingerprints remains unsolved.\\n\\nPolymer chain can be separated into a backbone and its side chains. Distinguishing the two components is theoretically important to predict polymer properties. However, it is not clear how to efficiently encode such information into a general descriptor for different classes of polymers. Similarly, developing descriptors for polymers consisting of more than one type of monomer is still an open challenge. For alternating copolymer, we can simply consider the combined repeating unit of multiple monomers as a \"metamonomer\", but the molecule\\n\\n11\\n\\nPolyethene\\n\\nPolystyrene\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n-*- RDKitFP\\n\\nECFP\\n\\nMACCS\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n*\\n\\nTanimoto index\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n×\\n\\nTanimoto index\\n\\n0.5\\n\\nRDKitFP\\n\\n+ ECFP\\n\\nx MACCS\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n.\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n6 8\\n\\n10\\n\\nNumber of monomers\\n\\n2 4\\n\\n6\\n\\n8 10\\n\\nNumber of monomers\\n\\nFigure 3: Convergence of the change of fingerprints for two polymers as a function of the number of monomers in the oligmer. The change is measured by Tanimoto index between the fingerprints of the monomer and the oligmer (n from 2 to 10), which represents the similarity of the two fingerprints. Three RDKit fingerprints implemented in XenonPy are used: RDKitFP denotes the standard fingerprint, ECFP denotes the Morgan fingerprint, and MACCS denotes the MACCS keys.\\n\\nmay become too big that conventional descriptors or fingerprints are not efficient anymore. Efficient descriptor for block or graft copolymers is yet to be found. Embedding methods using neural network can be a potential option, but problems such as invariance to the input order of monomers or generality to different types of chemical reactions used to form the polymers using multiple monomers remain to have no clear solution.\\n\\n## Predictive models\\n\\nOne of the key components in polymer design is the prediction of polymer properties relevant to a target application. Some of the important properties often considered in the polymer industry include transparency, glass transition temperature, toughness, etc.41 The ability to predict properties of different classes of polymers opens up new computational design approaches for polymers, such as high-throughput screening and inverse design, which will be discussed in the next section. One approach to predict polymer properties is building empirical equations based on physical descriptors and some basic properties of polymers.\\n\\n12\\n\\nAn effort to collect such equations in Python has been made by the thermo package. 42 This approach can be very powerful, but could be difficult to use when predicting properties for a new design with not much knowledge available yet. Another approach that is more suitable for design purpose, called the quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) modeling, aims at mapping structural descriptors of a material to its property. In particular, models that rely only on 2D structure information of the polymer is preferred as it avoids intensive geometry optimization for the polymer molecules. To date, around 300 articles can be found on the web of science database when searching with keywords QSPR and polymer.\\n\\nGroup contribution method is one of the earliest data-driven approaches to predict com- plex properties of different polymers.3 The basic idea is that certain groups of bonded atoms within different molecules may have common effects on a specific material property. Linear regression is used to model the interaction between groups when data is limited, but higher order models can also be used. Machine learning models using fingerprints as input can be seen as an extension to this idea, since the fingerprints are collections of rules that check the existence of different structural groups. Some commonly used models include elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, Gaussian process, neural network, etc. Table 2 summarizes some recent applications of these algorithms in polymer informatics.\\n\\nMachine learning models are inherently interpolative, i.e., their predictions are reliable only around the domain close to the training data. The range of properties prediction for certain types of polymers with a reasonable accuracy governs the potential search space one can cover, i.e., the performance of the final design. In other words, the training data determines the feasible design space of the target application. The concept of applicability domain (AD) developed in Cheminformatics is used to quantify the reliable region of a QSPR model. 49 The concept of uncertainty in statistics is also a popular metric believed to be strongly correlated with the validity of a prediction. 50 Figure 4 shows how different models fail to predict different materials properties when extrapolating from the given data. One idea to tackle this issue is called transfer learning, that is to exploit information learned from\\n\\n13\\n\\nTable 2: Examples of QSPR for different polymer properties using machine learning tech- nologies.

Yamada et al. demonstrated the successful applications of transfer learning in different materials science problem, including polymers. 51 Intuitive ideas for knowledge transfer include transferring from a global material space to a local domain, from a material property with rich data to a physically linked property with little data, or from computational data to experimental data. The latter idea is also called multi-fidelity learning, which has been successfully applied to predict crystallization tendency52 and bandgap53 of polymers.\\n\\n## Polymer design\\n\\nWhile there are increasing examples of machine-assisted polymer design, there has not been any report of end-to-end design example that covers every step from monomer design to manufacturing process. Instead, polymer informatics has been used to improve design effi- ciency within each step of of the polymer design process. For example, Wu et al. discovered new homopolymers with high thermal conductivity that are validated experimentally 15 and Li et al. developed an algorithm that discovers optimal strategy to experimentally control MWDs of various polymers.22 There are three types of design strategies based on machine learning technology: high-throughput screening, inverse design, and experimental design. We will discuss various efforts of applying these methods to polymer design in this section.\\n\\n## High-throughput screening\\n\\nHigh-throughput screening aims at identifying potential candidates of interest by conducting computational or experimental tests on a large pool of candidates. In polymer informatics, a library of chemically or synthetically feasible polymer candidates is built and then computa- tionally screened by predictive models relevant to the target material properties. When the search space is finite and tractable, the library is simply composed of the exhaustive list of candidates, such as selection of optimal processing method within the existing technologies.\\n\\n15\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nRandom\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nBR - Tg\\n\\nBR - HSP\\n\\nx CV-1\\n\\n+ CV-2\\n\\n.

The data is further separated into five groups, either randomly or through K-means clustering 55 with number of cluster = 5. The groupings are used for cross validation to test the predic- tion performance on glass transition temperatures (Tg) and Hildebrand solubility parameter (HSP). (b) Plots of predictions versus observed data for Tg and HSP based on Bayesian ridge regression (BR) and random forest (RF). Crosses are results from cross validation based on K-means clustering, i.e., each set of test data is not similar to the training data (extrapola- tion). Circles are results from cross validation based on random picking. The extrapolation case has a worse prediction accuracy all four cases, where the failure patterns are different between BR and RF.\\n\\n16\\n\\nOne can also use a library from any open databases. Otherwise, a generative algorithm is needed to construct a pool of candidates of interest. For example, a conventional approach is to define a set of molecular fragments of interest and exhaustively combine different num- bers of fragments up to an upper limit to form the candidate set. Fragment can be obtained from organic molecules which have more large open databases, such as GDB-1756 or Pub- chem. 57 To expand beyond the search space limited by a finite variety of fragments, Wu et al. implemented a language model proposed by Ikebata et al. 59 on polymers represented in SMILES.58 Different deep neural networks are also used to learn the SMILES or graph representation of organic molecules. 60-62\\n\\nGiving a library of candidates, one can use pretrained predictive models to computation- ally screen out candidates with target properties. There is a significant amount of literature that applies high-throughput screening to different polymer applications. Recent exam- ples of high-throughput screening in polymer designs using machine learning models include searching of high refractive index polymers46,63,64 and screening optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers. 65 This strategy of polymer design may sound inefficient to solve a single design problem, because a significantly large library is needed to increase the probability of finding candidates of interest. However, a well-developed library that contains diverse candi- dates can be reused for many different design problems. With a rich database of candidates, high-throughput screening is a very attractive tool in many industrial applications.\\n\\n## Inverse design\\n\\nAnother design strategy, referred as the inverse design, is to perform targeted search in a materials space guided by knowledge extracted from existing data. While predictive model is a mapping from an input x (polymer) to an output y (material property), the goal of inverse design is to map a targeted range of y to a sub-domain of x. This can be achieved by solving an optimization problem using sophisticated algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, or by sampling the set of x with high probability to be in the targeted range of y under a\\n\\n17\\n\\nBayesian framework. Both approaches can be implemented in an iterative algorithm:\\n\\n1. Start with a set of initial candidates.\\n\\n2. Propose a new set of candidates based on the existing ones.\\n\\n3. Evaluate likeliness of the candidates to have the desired material properties.\\n\\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for fixed number of times or until convergence.\\n\\nIn step 2, a generative algorithm is needed to propose new candidates similar to the one in the high-throughput screening. In the case of optimization, the likeliness metric in step 3 is usually a loss function measuring the distance of the predicted properties for the candidates and the targeted properties. For sampling, the likeliness metric is usually correlated with the probability of observing the candidates conditional on the targeted properties.\\n\\nThe inverse design problem is inherently ill-posed, i.e., there are different types of mate- rials that may have the target properties. It is important that an inverse design algorithm can produce a diverse set of candidates in order to maximize the probability of discovering novel functional materials. Typical optimization algorithm can only search for the optimal solution. Sampling methods can have a higher chance to provide diverse candidates, but can also be trapped in a local mode, especial when the search space is high dimensional. Many efforts have been made to address this issue, such as limiting the search space size, projecting the search space to a low dimensional space, or employing an annealing algorithm, etc. Table 3 shows some recent examples of successful inverse design of different polymer applications using machine learning technologies.\\n\\n## Experimental design\\n\\nThe previous two design strategies relies heavily on efficiency of the generative model and accuracy of the predictive model, which, in turn, relies on the quality and quantity of training data. Since many properties of polymers have only limited data, increasing data size with\\n\\n18\\n\\nTable 3: Examples of polymer inverse design using machine learning technologies.\\n\\n\\n\\n|Publication|Target property|Method\\n:selected:|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Mannodi-Kanakkithodi et al.

There are two perspectives to the optimality of candidate selection: (1) exploit the knowledge embedded in the existing data to make the best guess of which candidates may satisfy the design goal, or (2) explore candidates with the least information from the existing data to infer their properties. In a typical experimental design algorithm, we define a utility function that balance the tradeoff between the two perspectives. Candi- dates that optimize the utility function are selected for the next round of tests. Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning are two commonly used algorithms for experimental\\n\\n19\\n\\ndesign. The former considers candidates with a high prediction uncertainty as exploratory and optimize the utility function accordingly. The latter treats the problem as a game with reward when achieving the design goal, where an agent is trying to learn the best strategy (minimum number of experiments) to get the maximum reward (reaching the design goal). Table 4 shows some recent examples of experimental design applications on different stages of the hierarchical polymers design process.\\n\\nTable 4: Examples of polymer experimental design using machine learning technologies.\\n\\n\\n\\n|Publication|Target|Search space|Method|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Li et al.

However, polymer experiments are costly and syntheses of new polymers are difficult. Computational simulations are becoming more and more accessi- ble, yet calculations for new polymers often required labor-intensive tuning of model param- eters. Automatic simulation, synthetic planning, and property measurement for polymers remain challenging and are continuously explored by researchers in polymer informatics.\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nPolymer informatics is a promising tool for discovery of novel polymers. With a sufficiently large data set to support the use of modern machine learning technology, a data-driven\\n\\n20\\n\\napproach of polymer design will significantly improve the pace of making new functional polymers, satisfying the rapidly expanding demand on polymeric materials in modern society (e.g., deformable electronic devices74). One of the most important elements of polymer informatics is the availability of large open databases. Building such databases for polymer is challenging because of many reasons: (1) difficulty of encoding the hierarchical structure of polymers for machine learning purposes, (2) inconsistent naming rules throughout the history of polymer science, (3) lack of data sharing due to many privately own industrial data, etc. Nonetheless, this is an essential step towards a fully data-driven design process. Many efforts have been made to build the backbone technologies necessary to exploit the potential benefit of polymer informatics, such as developing new descriptors to better capture the physical properties of polymers and new simulation methods to estimate polymer properties with higher accuracy in a shorter time. The true power of polymer informatics is to release polymer scientists from the low efficiency trial-and-error design process, thus, to free up more time for higher level design concepts and theoretical advancements. Such opportunity can be realized only if we work together to push for a more open community in polymer science, where everyone can benefit from the new paradigm of polymer design. An easy first step to take would be to engage in the field of polymer informatics and experience the new way of studying polymers ourselves.\\n\\n## Acknowledgement\\n\\nThis work was supported in part by the \"Materials Research by Information Integration\" Initiative (MI2I) project of the Support Program for Starting Up Innovation Hub from Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

      "\n",
      "From the early days of Staudinger's groundbreaking hypothesis, which brought forth the concept of macromolecules, to the development of modern polymer science — each epoch has witnessed milestones that shaped our understanding and depiction of these intricate materials. Not only did these advancements clarify the structure and properties of polymers, but they also charted a course for the evolution of representation frameworks, enabling us to visualize and predict polymer behaviors in unprecedented detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trailblazers in the field have toiled to resolve the challenges of representing polymers, each approach more innovative than the last. For instance, 'Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review' by Wei et al. [1], underscores the importance of accurately capturing the complexity of thermal processes within polymers, a significant aspect influencing their representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advancements in the discipline surged forward as researchers like Stephen Wu and colleagues examined the potential of polymer informatics and machine learning in 'Potentials and challenges of polymer informatics: exploiting machine learning for polymer design' [2]. Their work showed the power of data-driven approaches to transcend traditional barriers in design and representation. Furthermore, the research exposed critical challenges such as lack of open databases and unified structural representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complexity of polymer chemistry was honored by cutting-edge computational strategies as detailed in the paper 'Chemical Potential of a Flexible Polymer Liquid in a Coarse-Grained Representation' by Dinpajooh et al. [3]. Their scientific inquiry paved the way for better representations through coarse-grained models, which are now instrumental in simplifying complex structures for computational study.\n",
      "\n",
      "These historical forays into the realm of polymer representation have culminated in a contemporary understanding that deftly navigates the traits of these versatile materials. Today, leveraging computational tools, scientists can predict polymer behaviors, fine-tune their properties, and imagine new applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we segue into the next section, we find it successively rooted in our historical narrative. Current computational approaches to polymer representation have flourished from these past successes and learning challenges, setting a robust groundwork upon which novel and transformative methodologies continue to emerge. This evolution translates the meticulous work of our predecessors into a language spoken by supercomputers and algorithms, proposing a future where the properties and potentialities of polymers are unveiled with the click of a mouse.\n",

      "In this article, we review thermal transport in polymers with different morphologies from aligned fibers to bulk amorphous states. We survey early and recent efforts in engineering polymers with high thermal conductivity by fabricating polymers with large-scale molecular alignments. The experimentally realized extremely high thermal conductivity of polymer nanofibers are highlighted, and understanding of thermal transport physics are discussed. We then transition to the discussion of bulk amorphous polymers with an emphasis on the physics of thermal transport and its relation with the conformation of molecular chains in polymers. We also discuss the current understanding of how the chemistry of polymers would influence thermal transport in amorphous polymers and some limited, but important chemistry-structural-property relationships. Lastly, challenges, perspectives and outlook of this field are presented. We hope this review will inspire more fundamental and applied research in the polymer thermal transport field to advance scientific understanding and engineering applications.\n",

      "Achieving high thermal conductivity in polymers is desirable for contemporary applications such as electronics packaging,1 thermal interface materials 2 and polymeric heat exchangers.3 These applications have triggered a renewed interest in exploiting thermally conductive polymers using a variety of fabrication methods, such as mechanical stretching,4, 5 electrospinning,6 nanoscale templating,7 compositing, 8, 9 and polymer blending.10 By drawing amorphous polyethylene (PE) into highly aligned fibers, chain entanglements and voids, which act as stress concentration points and phonon scattering centers in the amorphous form, are significantly reduced, leading to a thermal conductivity increase by two to three orders of magnitude.4, 11-16\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides changing the global morphology of polymers, composites are more commonly pursued in real applications since they are easier to realize and cost-effective. By compositing amorphous polymers with thermally conductive particles, thermal conductivity can be improved to as much as ~10 W/mK,17-21 and such improvement can be potentially enhanced by strong particle-matrix interfacial adhesion (e.g., covalent bond,22-24 T- Tt stacking,25 and hydrogen bond26-30) and better vibrational spectra coupling.31 Despite consistent improvements in composite thermal conductivity, the bottleneck is still the low thermal conductivity of the polymer matrices. Theoretical calculation has pointed out that a composite thermal conductivity greater than 20 W/mK is more likely to be achieved if the polymer matrix has an intrinsic thermal conductivity larger than 1 W/mK.32 However, the details of thermal transport in pure amorphous polymers are still not thoroughly understood, leaving limited guidance on designing polymers with intrinsic high thermal conductivity.\n",

Chen et al's review33 focused mostly on polymer composites, and the rest of the reviews surveyed both polymers and composites.

We first review recent advancements in the understanding and engineering of thermal conductivity through changing the global morphology of polymers. Specifically, we will discuss the physical origin of the high thermal conductivity in polymer chains, and how this was realized in experiments. This is followed by more discussion of studies that try to understand factors that influence the thermal conductivity of aligned polymers using mainly molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We then shift to the discussion of bulk polymers and the recent experimental and modeling studies aiming to reveal the fundamental thermal transport physics. Notable works that produce thermal conductivity higher than 1 W/mK are discussed and the mechanisms also analyzed. We also discuss the concept of using external stimulation to tune the thermal conductivity of polymers. Lastly, we discuss challenges, perspectives and outlook in this field.\n",

      "Polymers, those once believed to be thermal insulators, are now breaking the boundary between insulators and thermal conductors, thanks to a few seminal works showing that the thermal conductivity of polymer fibers can be even higher than common metals.4, 11, 38, 39 Fibrous or elongated polymers have much higher thermal conductivity when compared to their bulk counterparts. Bulk polymers unavoidably have both compositional and structural defects and disorders, which introduce significant phonon scattering along the heat conduction pathway or even change the nature of heat carriers and their transport mechanism (see Section 3). Thus, polymer fibers/nanofibers, which can be engineered at the molecular level, have come into the light and become a highly promising class of material for thermal conduction applications.\n",

We start with the discussion of simulation, theoretical and experimental tools used for thermal transport measurement and understanding of polymer fibers, which are also popular tools for bulk amorphous polymers. We then discuss different synthetic methods developed for fabricating polymer fibers with high thermal conductivity. Finally, we focus on how the microscopic and molecular-level structure of the polymer fibers affects phonon transport and thermal conductivity. In polymer fiber studies, PE is the most researched material, which stands out to be one of the most promising polymers to attain high thermal conductivity, and it has been a great platform to understand interesting physics related to phonon transport and structure-property relations. There has also been much work done on polymers like polythiophene (PTs), polyimide (PI), polystyrene (PS), polyurethane (PU), and polymer composite fibers, which will also be mentioned in this section.\n",

DFT can be more accurate in modeling interatomic interactions since it does not need empirical potentials, but it is computationally expensive and is best suited to model perfect crystals to predict the upper limit of thermal conductivity. MD, on the other hand, can simulate much larger systems to account for factors like defects and amorphous conformation, but its accuracy depends on the fidelity of empirical potentials. MD has been a valuable tool to explore the structure-property relations of polymers. Each method is further discussed in the following sections.\n",

      "MD simulation is one of the most widely used and powerful tools for thermal conductivity calculation of polymer fibers. 39, 51-53, 62, 63 Using this method, Henry et al. predicted that a single extended PE chain would have infinite thermal conductivity due to lack of ergodicity,39 which largely re-fueled the study of thermally conductive polymer fibers experimentally.4 MD simulations can model much larger structures (up to millions of atoms) than DFT, which helps research reveal the structure-property relation that is more relevant to real conditions. It also allows the study of thermal transport physics related to phonon scattering of defects (e.g., segmental rotation, amorphous regions, chain ends, or voids) - important factors preventing polymer fibers from reaching the theoretical limit from DFT calculation of perfect crystals.54-56, 64 There are two different kinds of MD methods used for thermal conductivity calculations, equilibrium MD (EMD) and non-equilibrium MD (NEMD), where EMD is conducted in an equilibrium state without temperature gradients, while in NEMD, a steady-state temperature gradient is established. A typical MD simulation consists of three steps: (1) starting structure construction; (2) relaxation and optimization; and (3) production runs. A reasonable starting structure followed by careful relaxation and optimization is critical to achieving the correct molecular configuration to accurately predict the thermal conductivity, which can be a strong function of the subtle conformation of chains. 12, 54-56, 65, 66\n",

      "In NEMD methods, either a temperature gradient is established via thermostats (i.e., normal NEMD), or a scheme called reverse NEMD68 is used to swap atom kinetic energy between the two thermal reservoirs to establish a heat flux. When the system reaches a steady-state, the thermal conductivity is calculated by Fourier's law, k = - ar, where Jis heat flux, and - is temperature gradient in the heat flux direction.

      "The choice for heat bath is crucial for calculating accurate thermal transport properties in MD simulations, especially for systems where long wavelength phonons dominates.71, 72 Two frequently used heat baths are Nosé-Hoover heat bath (deterministic and time-reversible) and Langevin heat bath (stochastic and time-irreversible).71 The generation and accumulation of localized edge modes in Nosé-Hoover bath require multiple layers of Nosé-Hoover bath to diminish the boundary layer's temperature differences.73, 74 In contrast, Langevin baths have stochastic excitation of all modes, which prevents the accumulation of localized edge modes and generates marginal temperature differences at the boundary. Usually, we find that amorphous polymers are more immune to the effect of thermostats since the structural disorder can quickly scatter phonons generated by the thermostats to recover the intrinsic phonon distribution. However, a recent study showed that heat carrier MFP in amorphous polymer can be tens or even more than 100 nm, and there can be size effect in NEMD simulations.75 As a result, the effect of thermostats in NEMD calculation of amorphous polymer thermal conductivity deserves a detailed study in the future.\n",

      "The accurate prediction of thermal conductivity depends on the fidelity of the interatomic potentials. Both all-atom and united atom models have been used for polymer thermal conductivity calculations.39, 63, 67,76 The major difference between these two types of force fields is whether hydrogen atoms are explicitly represented. Henry et al. argued that the explicit simulation of hydrogen atoms is necessary to capture all degrees of freedom, which is important to thermal conductivity. However, the comparison was between two different potentials (Adaptive intermolecular reactive bond order (AIREBO)77 vs. Kirkwood78). It is not yet conclusive on how important an effect the united atom model has on thermal conductivity. However, the hydrogen degrees of freedom are largely un-excited at room temperature due to quantum effects - a justification used in many studies using the united atom models. A few most commonly used all-atom potentials for thermal conductivity studies include AIREBO potential,77 the Class-II potential PCFF (polymer constant force field),79 and COMPASS force field (Condensed phase optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies). 80-82\n",

      "Thermal bridge method: Thermal bridge method (Fig. 2a) is straightforward with relatively high precision based on Fourier's law for measuring thermal conductivity values.7, 11, 12, 85-87 It was used more than two decades ago when people directly attached the polymer fiber to a heat sink and a heater for the steady-state heat flow.87 However, precision and sample size requirements were largely limited at that time, where only micron-sized fiber or fiber bundles could be handled. The thermal bridge method has been commercialized and standardized, which allows for the measurement of much thinner fibers (down to dozens of nanometers) with improved precision. The modern thermal bridge method consists of two separate islands of heaters/sensors made of platinum/SiNx maintained at different temperatures. The polymer fiber serves as a bridge connecting these two islands and conducting heat from the high to the low- temperature islands. A combined DC and AC current is introduced to one island for Joule heating and resistance measuring, making this island the heater component. Simultaneously, on the opposite island, an AC with the same value is applied for sensing the resistance across the bridge. The thermal conductance of the fiber can then be measured.\n",

In a typical AFM cantilever method setup (Fig. 2b), a tipless AFM cantilever bi-material (SiNx coated with a gold film) is used for drawing and connecting one end of the polymer fiber.88 The other end of the fiber adheres to a thermocouple on a needle tip made of conductive silver epoxy. Electrical current was applied to the needle for Joule heating and temperature adjustment. A laser beam with a wavelength of 650 nm was focused onto the tip of the AFM cantilever, which is subsequently reflected onto a receiving photodiode for deflection measurement.

A beam splitter will divide the laser into a pump and a probe beam whose optical paths are adjusted by a series of delay stages. Finally, both the probe and pump beams will be focused by an objective lens onto the surface of the sample (Fig. 2c). A multi-layer heat transfer model is fitted to obtain the thermal conductivity from TDTR signals. When measuring fiber samples, the fibers are first embedded into epoxy and then cut open to expose the cross-section of the fiber. A metal transducer layer is then deposited on the exposed cross-section, and TDTR is performed so that the thermal conductivity in the fiber length direction is measured. However, the application of this method is mostly limited by the laser spot size, which should be smaller than the cross-sectional area of the fiber. Thinner fibers require an objective lens with a higher magnification ratio, and most of the measuring samples are thicker than 10 um. To measure the heat conduction along the radial direction, the polymer fibers need to be indented to create a flat surface before the deposition of the transducer layer.\n",

C-SThM may be a potential candidate to measure very thin fibers because it is possible to measure the thermal conductance of single molecules.90 A SThM tip serves as a heater and the substrate for the molecule as the heat sink, and both of them are made of gold. Between them is the molecule (e.g., a single alkanedithiol molecule) subject to measurement. For sample preparation, the gold substrate was immersed in a diluted solution of target molecules for self-assembly, then the molecule would form a bridge between the SThM tip and the gold by moving the SThM tip away from the gold substrate. C-SThM represents some of the most delicate systems to measure extremely small thermal signals, which makes measuring single molecular thermal conductance possible.\n",

      "In pursuit of higher thermal conductivity, researchers had come up with many different synthesis techniques for manufacturing polymer fiber/nanofiber. Spinning is the most mentioned method for making polymer fibers in mass production, and ultra-drawing has been effective for further increasing the thermal conductivity. For spinning, there are mainly wet spinning, dry spinning, electrospinning, melt spinning, and gel spinning, which are more suitable for large-scale manufacturing at low cost.91 Table 2 compares these spinning methods. Among them, electrospinning is the most researched method because of its relatively small batch-to-batch difference and easy-to-control nature, which has been applied to polymers such as PE,92 PI,93 Nylon,6 PAN, and PMMA.94 There are also other synthesis methods for polymer fibers. For example, the nanotemplate can produce an array of polymer fibers with high thermal conductivity.95 Utilizing a nano-porous nanotemplate, it is possible to obtain chain-oriented polymer nanofibers. Figure 3a shows a comparison of thermal conductivity among different synthesis methods. Fiber drawing is both experimentally38, 88 and theoretically14, 54 proven to be effective for improving thermal conductivity, and experimental results have shown that it is possible to achieve thermal conductivity over 100 W/mK,88 which makes it comparable to that of many metals. Heat stretching after the tip-drawn step can further increase the thermal conductivity.11 In the following sub-sections, we briefly discuss the synthesis methods used to achieve high thermal conductivity polymer fibers.\n",

      "Electrospinning: Electrospinning is one of the most popular methods in the large-scale production of polymer fibers. A typical electrospinning setup is often composed of a heated syringe pump, a high voltage region (> 10 kV) for spinning, and a grounded fiber collector (inset in Fig. 3b).92 Under this high voltage electric field, the polymer solution will form a Taylor cone and generate an elongated jet flow, becoming progressively thinner before reaching the grounded collector because of solvent evaporation and external force field. Besides its low cost, electrospinning has the advantage of being suitable for a wide range of polymers from high melting point polymers like PI93 to lower ones like PE,92 or even composite polymer fibers like PAN/graphene or PMMA/graphene composite fibers.94\n",

      "Processing conditions in electrospinning are essential for obtaining high thermal conductivity for polymer fibers.92 A higher voltage will lead to a stronger working electric field for the spinning process, increasing the elongation force and ratio and increasing the chain alignment in the fibers.6, 86 This is in line with the finding that the stretching process during spinning will reduce the fiber diameter, and fibers with smaller diameters will improve the orientation of crystallites in the polymer fibers, which in turn increases the thermal conductivity.98 However, too high a voltage will reduce the flight time for the spun polymer fibers to grow crystalline areas. Due to the existence of whipping instability in the electrospinning process, the thermal conductivity of the as-spun fibers can vary significantly even if other conditions are the same.\n",

      "Solid-state extrusion (melt spinning): A solid-state extrusion setup comprises a piston that exerts a high pressure onto the polymer, a cylindrical cavity that serves as a container for the raw materials, and a die that gives shape for to-be-extruded polymer fibers.100 This technique is a simplified version of electrospinning. Solid-state extrusion products often come with a high extrusion rate, and it improves the thermal conductivity of polymer fiber by increasing crystallinity and better chain and lamellae orientation, both of which benefit phonon transport along the chain direction.100\n",
      "\n",
      "Gel-spinning: Gel-spinning101 (also called dry-wet spinning) is a method very similar to solid-state extrusion, but the polymers are under a gel-state (partly liquid and partly solid). For gel-spinning, polymers go through several steps before becoming fibers. First, the polymers are dissolved in an organic solvent at elevated temperatures. This solution is then extruded and goes through a two-stage cooling and drying, where the air will remove excess solvent, and water cooling will quench the polymer into a gel state. Finally, spinneret will spin the gel state polymers into fibers. In gel-spinning, molecules will intertwine with each other, and polymer chains in the gel state will bind together and produce an enhanced inter-chain interaction along the chain direction, forming a network inside the polymer fiber and making it easier to obtain fibers with a higher draw ratio. This is the reason why gel-spinning tends to produce the highest thermal conductivity among all these other methods.\n",

A typical method for wet spinning is tip spinning, where a needle tip dips into a polymer solution at an elevated temperature, and as it pulls out, a fiber can be drawn from the solution.98 Since the drawing process is at room temperature, more defects tend to emerge in the drawn fiber. If the drawing rate is not precisely controlled, the room temperature cools down the fiber quickly, and the molecular chains will not have enough time to rearrange themselves. This method is not easily scalable for manufacturing polymer fibers in mass production.\n",

      "Dry spinning: Dry spinning is a method developed for heat-sensitive polymer fibers.99 Typical dry spinning equipment is composed of three parts, including a polymer container with a spinneret, which extrudes polymer fibers, an evaporation cabinet for solvent evaporation, and a stretching device. In dry spinning, bulk polymers are first dissolved in volatile organic solvents to form a low viscosity fluid, which is then extruded into an evaporation cabinet where hot inert gas like nitrogen is used to evaporate the solvents in the polymer fiber. Finally, the dried fiber will be collected and further drawn to achieve a higher fiber orientation. It is a handy method for heat-sensitive polymers, polymers susceptible to thermal decomposition, such as polymers like PVC (polyvinyl chloride), cellulose acetate, and polybenzimidazole (PBI).99 However, the need for volatile solvents to some extent limits the selection of processable polymers.\n",

      "Nanotemplate: Apart from spinning, nanotemplate, which is convenient and features small batch-to- batch variation, is another method for large-scale manufacturing of high thermal conductivity polymer fibers. 7, 95, 102 Nanotemplate can use commercial AAO (nanoporous aluminum oxide) templates, and it has been shown that the as-synthesized polymer fiber can be easily separated from the template by etching it away, which does not damage the polymer fibers or change their structures.\n",

      "PE nanofibers synthesized from melt-processed nanotemplate method showed that a smaller fiber diameter and higher molecular weight would yield higher thermal conductivity (7 W/mK). 95 It is also feasible to begin this process with monomers, and methods like electropolymerization were employed to polymerize the monomers to synthesize chain-oriented PI fibers.7 The resultant PI fiber had a thermal conductivity of 4.4 W/mK. A combination of high thermal conductivity and high-temperature thermal stability (200 ℃) makes it a possible candidate for TIM (thermal interfacial material) in electronic devices,7 but the stiffness of the film is a concern for forming conformal contacts with rough surfaces. Different from spinning, nanotemplate may be used to synthesize large arrays of polymer fibers, but using AAO template as a consumable for such fabrication makes the cost a major concern. In addition, the shape and shape distribution of the nanofibers largely depend on the quality of nanotemplate. Even a small difference in these templates will lead to a massive difference in thermal conductivity.7, 103\n",

      "Other methods: Other methods used to produce thermally conductive polymers include oCVD (oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition)104 and solvent separation.105 oCVD is a one-pot reaction method, where all the precursors are gathered as vapor phases in a vacuum chamber. Heating and pressure conditions are tuned to trigger the step polymerization reaction. The advantages of this method are that this is an all- dry species vapor phase reaction, where no solvent is presented, which allows for easier fabrication of films without the need for post-processing. Moreover, oCVD makes it possible to take control of both intramolecular and intermolecular structures when polymerization happens. Solvent separation for polymer fiber fabrication is comparatively more complex, and it only works for certain types of polymers (e.g., PA105) with limited yields. This method can be useful for small batch lab synthesis when spinning or other types of synthesis are not available.\n",

It was proven that under a high drawing ratio and a slow drawing rate, one could obtain extremely high thermal conductivity.88 In stark contrast to their bulk counterparts, polymer fibers with drawing ratios greater than 400 can have more than two orders of magnitude higher thermal conductivity. Large elongation can effectively alter the orientation, distribution, and morphology of molecular, chain segments, crystalline and amorphous areas, and microscopic structures.11, 14, 98, 107 A combination of optimal drawing rate and drawing ratio largely determines the amplitude of thermal conductivity for a polymer fiber.107\n",

      "The significant increase in polymer fiber thermal conductivity after the drawing is intimately related to the change of the morphologies in the fiber structure. Under a strong strain field, twinning will facilitate the lamellar structure changing into a fibrillar structure.110 Compared to the lamellar structure, these microfibrillar structures are domains with bundles of highly ordered and oriented chains along the heat conduction direction, facilitating phonon transport and lowering their scattering. There are two stages\n",

      "of structural change in mechanical stretching, which are crucial in understanding the effects on thermal conductivity:101 (1) The amorphous area will form microfibrils. The crystalline lamellae area will shatter into several smaller crystalline blocks sandwiched by those amorphous areas; (2) Some intrafibrillar tie molecules will connect the crystalline blocks, which lie outside the microfibrils region in the first step. Upon larger strains, these intrafibrillar molecules will extend and align themselves. A higher strain ratio and slower strain rate can both improve the chain orientation in polymer nanofibers.109 When the polymer fiber is stretched under a much slower elongation process, there will be more time for the uncoiling of chain segments and rotation of chains to adjust themselves for better alignment. However, if the polymer fiber is not perfect in radius or chain segment distribution, excessive drawing can lead to the rupture of nanofiber inside the polymer fiber, which can also contribute to phonon scattering. Furthermore, a drawing speed too high can also be detrimental for thermal conductivity improvement, which will lead to internal stress buildup and limit the achievable elongation ratio at a given temperature.76, 112\n",

The local heating method was found to be advantageous as it can achieve higher strain rate and minimize the relaxation of the molecules. 11\n",

      "In terms of how heat stretching influences fiber crystallinity, however, there have been mixed messages. While local heating was found to increase the crystallinity,11 other reports showed that heat stretching could lower the crystallinity.84,89 It seems the different processing conditions may play a role in the change of crystallinity during heat stretching. In the case of reduced crystallinity (Fig. 5b), the enhancement in thermal conductivity was attributed to the shrinking of the amorphous region, and the more ordered structure in the remaining amorphous regions.\n",

However, recent work done by experiments89 and simulations113 started to explore the radial thermal conductivity in polymer fibers. Under mechanical strain, the phonon focusing effect is the main reason for a decrease in thermal conductivity in the radial direction, where the phonon velocity increases along the axial direction and decreases in the radial direction. Without strain, MD simulations showed a strong size effect in the radial direction for thermal conductivity, and the thermal conductivity in the radial direction might be much higher than their amorphous counterparts.113\n",

      "Large crystallites and better alignment will increase the intermediate-range order, and phonon MFP, which increases the thermal conductivity.6 We can often find high crystallinity and large crystallite sizes in most high thermal conductivity polymer fibers. The reason that one can never achieve the theoretical value of high thermal conductivity is that, in reality, it is impossible to synthesize purely crystalline polymers. However, it is shown that factors like orientation, crystalline-amorphous interfaces, and phase distribution need to be considered, and thus a high crystallinity does not always guarantee high thermal conductivity if the crystallites are not well aligned in the polymer.92, 123 While the crystalline domains should have much higher thermal conductivity than their amorphous counterparts,112 the existence of amorphous phases between these crystalline domains can present large thermal resistance.7, 110 In addition, the crystal- amorphous interface can also scatter phonons.112 It is not clear how large a role such interfacial thermal resistance plays in the overall thermal conductivity. It has been shown that if the amorphous region consists of linker molecules, the crystal-amorphous interface is connected by covalent bonds, which present much smaller resistance than the amorphous region itself.64 However, if the interface is connected by purely weak vdW forces, the relative importance of the interfacial resistance will depend on the size of the amorphous domain, which might still dominate the overall thermal resistance given its low thermal conductivity.\n",

The contribution towards thermal conductivity from covalent bonds is much higher than that from weak forces like vdW forces.76 Stronger inter-chain vdW and large dihedral angle energy will confine the chains and limit the rotation of chain segments, 52, 56 giving rise to higher thermal stability and thermal conductivity.56 However, inter-chain vdW interaction can also scatter phonons inside the chain, impeding thermal transport.127 Apparently, the above-mentioned competing effects coexist. Intra-chain vdW forces would mostly work adversely to thermal transport as it can lead chains to coil, impairing the thermal transport efficiency of the covalent backbone but itself has limited contribution to thermal conductivity.128 Such effect is better demonstrated in amorphous polymers as will be discussed in Section 3.5.3.\n",

In this sense, it was found that lighter and more symmetric side groups are less detrimental to phonon transport.125 Simulations on bottlebrush polymers showed that longer side chains led to more disorders in the polymer and reduced thermal conductivity.130 Thermal conductivity of bottlebrush polymers with aligned backbones decreases sharply with the increasing side chain length and eventually converge to a low value, which can be explained by the fact that the interchain scattering among those long side chains increases.130 It was shown with the XRD pattern that longer side chains led to an overall polymer morphology between crystalline and amorphous phase, where an amorphous-like structure appeared in those excellently aligned polymer bottlebrush fibers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Backbone: When considering the polymer chain backbones, stiffer ones usually lead to higher thermal conductivity.16 As a result, it is shown that high modulus polymer fibers generally have higher thermal conductivity. The high moduli of polymer fibers originate from the strong covalent bonds along the backbone. Such strong intra-chain bonding can lead to higher phonon group velocity. However, there are also exceptions. For example, Kevlar, which has higher modulus than PE, displayed much lower thermal conductivity than PE. It was found that in Kevlar the energy of one of the dihedral angles along the backbone is exceptionally weak, and segmental rotation happens frequently around this dihedral angle, leading to disorder scattering.56 Other MD simulations of polymers (e.g., PDMS and PE) also revealed the same mechanism. 52, 131 Another MD work predicted that Kevlar fibers, if fully stretched to eliminate the segmental rotation, the thermal conductivity could be increased from 11.01 W/mK to 147.99 W/mK.55 It was also found that large chain segmental rotation can reduce the phonon group velocity besides phonon MFP, which also contribute to thermal conductivity reduction (Fig. 8).55 Chemical structures like double bonds or T-T stacking interactions are highly useful for improving the polymer chain's stiffness and reducing segment rotation, which offered useful insight to the structure-property relation for designing thermally conductive polymer fibers.56, 59, 104 In addition, thermal conductivity can also be improved by restricting the angular bending freedom.132\n",

This was experimentally illustrated by using y-ray to cut the polymer chains shorter in polymer fibers.136, 137 The reduction in the degree of polymerization in a UHMWPE fiber from 1700 to 200 halved its thermal conductivity. Besides, the presence of heavy atoms in the monomer can lead to lower thermal conductivity since they will lead to lower phonon group velocity.56 A parametric MD study indicated a negative relationship between atomic mass and thermal conductivity of a model polymer.67\n",

All these defects serve as phonon scattering centers. Like drawing, the fabrication process can largely eliminate large extrinsic defects like voids as chains become more aligned. The molecular level defects can scatter phonons significantly in the absence of extrinsic defects. For example, it was found that kinks in the backbone can twist polymer chains and reduce thermal conductivity dramatically (Fig. 9).131 MD simulations prediction showed that a perfect PE chain with no defects could have thermal conductivity as high as 1400 W/mK and that of a defect-free PE fiber could exceed 300 W/mK.57, 129 However, the highest thermal conductivity experimentally obtained is much lower (~104 W/mK) even ultra-drawing Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review. 29\n",

Carbon nano- materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes and graphene) are promising fillers,33 but they tend to be much more expensive and their dispersion is not as well controlled as conventional fillers. In addition, since the primary purpose of thermal interface materials is to fill the air gaps between two rough surfaces, the polymer composite needs to be soft so that it can conform to the surface landscape, but softer polymers usually have lower speed of sound and lower thermal conductivity than stiffer ones. 145, 146 Moreover, loading excessive amount of fillers also stiffens polymers, impairing their ability to conform to surfaces.

The understanding of polymer thermal conductivity largely borrowed the physical picture for amorphous inorganic materials. The explanation of thermal conductivity in amorphous dielectrics started from Kittel,153 who used a variant of the solution to the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, K = cvl/3,153 where c is volumetric heat capacity, v the average phonon group velocity and / the MFP. This is essentially the same formula for describing any phonon gas thermal conductivity, but the difference lies in . By analyzing a number of amorphous glasses, l was determined to be approximately a constant of ~7 Å. The physical interpretation is that amorphous materials have random networks of atoms, and when the dominant phonons have wavelengths shorter than the characteristic length of the atomic network, boundary scattering of the unit cells would lead to a constant l roughly equal to the atomic scale characteristic length.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a constant MFP cannot explain the thermal conductivity trend at the low temperature limit (0.1-1 K). It has been observed that thermal conductivity of all amorphous polymers has similar magnitude and a characteristic trend of ~T2 below 1 K (Fig. 11a), similar to those observed in amorphous inorganics in the same temperature range (~T1.8).154 At low temperatures, heat capacity c ~ T3, while the excited phonons have the same v, and thus the temperature dependency of / would determine the overall behavior of K. When the temperature is sufficiently low, the dominant heat carriers are long wavelength phonons, much longer than the atomic characteristic lengths. In such situations, amorphous materials behave like Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review. 33\n",

      "elastic media, where the detailed atomic structure is not important to the transport of these long wavelength phonons. The argument was that these modes thus would have long MFPs since they cannot be effectively scattered by the structure and the anharmonicity is insignificant at low temperatures. However, this would lead to no difference between the thermal conductivity behaviors of amorphous materials and crystalline lattice, whose thermal conductivity scales with T3 at low temperatures, where l is bounded by boundary scatterings (Fig. 11a).\n",
      "\n",
      "Klemens, in one of his early seminal works,155 introduced the idea of structure scattering due to the disorder of the amorphous structure. He argued that while disordered structures lack regularity, instantaneous displacement of atoms can still be projected into plane waves, but these plane waves interact with each other inelastically even at the harmonic limit. It is noted that in crystals, these plane waves do not interact with each other at low temperature where anharmonicity is weak. He further argued that for modes with wavelength much larger than the lattice constant, phonons behave like propagating modes in crystals, but for modes with wavelength smaller than the lattice constant, the MFP is a constant. This model led to a K ~ T relation at the low temperature limit, while K ~ c (heat capacity) at high temperatures. Ziman156 had proposed a similar model. Both models showed that for long wavelength phonon MFP, I ~ 0-2, and since c ~ T3 and vis constant, using Kittel's model (K = cvl/3) will eventually give the K ~ T' (note: this conclusion used the fact that the dominant phonon to thermal transport has @ ~ T considering a linear dispersion157). Despite the discrepancy between Klemens' theory and the experimental trend observed at extremely low temperatures (~T2 < 1 K154), his model managed to capture thermal conductivity of quartz glass in a wide temperature range of ~ 4 - 90 K.155 It is noted that the experimental data used in his work did not extend below 1 K.\n",

When a phonon impacting the atom in the two-level system has a large enough energy to help the atom overcome the energy barrier, the phonon energy is absorbed and incoherently re-emitted, which leads to an inelastic scattering of the phonon. They have derived that the phonon MFP due to such scattering follows / ~ 0-1. When considering that the dominant phonon frequency is proportional to temperature at low temperatures (i.e., ( ~ T), one can derive / ~ T1, and then the model would successfully yield K~ ~ T3T-1 = T2 (Fig. 11a). Combining Anderson's model for long wavelength modes and constant MFP for higher frequency modes, Choy152 successfully fit the whole curve for PMMA thermal conductivity from 0.1 to 300 K. The interesting plateaus universally appear for amorphous materials, including both organics and inorganics (Fig. 11a), around 5-10 K turns out to be a simple superposition effect of the long and short wavelength phonon contributions to the thermal conductivity. It is worth mentioning that from fitting experimental data of polymers, Choy152 found the constant MFP to be around 7.2 Å for PMMA, which is very similar to that of the inorganic glass as found by Kittel.153\n",

Even for the same type of polymer (e.g., PE), with different morphologies (e.g., crystalline vs. amorphous PE), the temperature trends differ.

      "thermal conductivity should decrease due to enhanced anharmonic phonon scattering. As shown in Fig. 11b, the high temperature behavior of crystalline PE can be roughly described by TI - the same as those of silicon and quartz also shown in the figure. For amorphous polymers, however, the reason for their temperature trend has been attributed to the decrease in density due to thermal expansion above the glass transition temperature, Tg. Hattori164 proposed that above the glass transition temperature, micro-Brownian motion of polymer molecules became excited, which led to the increase in the molecular mobility, but we are not clear why such enhanced mobility decreases thermal conductivity. The increased mobility should have increased the thermal transport contributed by advection. However, recent simulations have found that such advection terms are negligibly small in thermal conductivity, and the decrease in thermal conductivity is associated with the decrease in density as temperature increases.111 In the book from van Krevelan and Nijgenhuis,165 thermal conductivity values of ten polymers from very low temperature to temperature higher than Tg was plotted, and an phenomenological model from Bicerano166 was able to fit the data trend for the whole temperature range well. More recently, an empirical model was developed for thermal conductivity of amorphous polymers based on the kinetic theory, where density, monomer molecular weight, and sound speed were the only parameters needed for predictions.167 The model agreed well with experimental data when it comes to temperature-dependence of thermal conductivity.\n",

      "It has long been observed that polymer thermal conductivity increases with density. As a first approximation, Hands et al.151 used the thermal conductivity model for liquids168 K~p3 for polymers above the glass transition temperature, where p is density. By surveying a number of polymers with different densities, it seems that such a relation can reasonably describe the thermal conductivity trend as a function of density (Fig. 12a). This model would predict a decreasing trend as a function of temperature. Such a decreasing trend is fundamentally different from that in lattice thermal conductivity due to anharmonic phonon scattering. *\n",

      "However, if we fit the data using a power law, it would yield K~p0.9 (Fig. 12a). We would like to cast our doubts on the application of the model for liquid thermal conductivity to polymers. We have recently found that thermal transport along the polymer chain backbone contributes more significantly to thermal conductivity via the strong intra-molecular covalent bonding interactions than inter-molecular interactions (Fig. 12b).111 In contrast, thermal transport in liquids is due to advection and inter-molecular energy transfer. It has been proven that the change in density (Fig. 12c) is accompanied by the change in radius of gyration (Rg) of polymer chains, which influences the thermal transport along the polymer chain backbone (Fig. 12d). When density decreases, the chains have more room to move, which can influence the Rg due to the competition of enthalpic and entropic effects, 111 and thus change the contribution from the intra-chain interaction to thermal conductivity. In the meantime, the reduced density enlarges inter-molecular distance which will lead to a decrease in thermal conductivity contributed by the inter-molecular interactions.111 These two competing effects would lead to a trend slower than p3 (e.g., p0.9 seen in Fig. 12a) which was derived for liquids. It is clear from the MD simulation results in Fig. 12c-d, thermal conductivity follows a trend that resembles that of Rg as a function of temperature. Of course, Rg also depends on the type of polymers, and thus might not be fair to simply say it would be larger for lower density polymers. However, it is our belief that the thermal conductivity dependence on density of polymers is much more complicated than that in simple liquids. In addition, the impact of density on the inter-molecular thermal transport alone would not be universal since different types of interactions (e.g., vdW and Coulombic interactions) have different decay rates as the interatomic separation enlarges (e.g., vdW ~ r6, and Coulombic ~ r'), which are found to be critically important in interpreting the trend of polymer thermal conductivity.169\n",

In the classical limit, there are 3N (N is the number of atoms) vibrational modes in a system and higher density leads to higher volumetric heat capacity.

A recent mode-resolved study showed that contribution from localized modes in disordered SiO2 is non-negligible due to their correlation with the spatially extended but non-propagating modes (diffusons),174 and we expect non-negligible contribution from the localized modes in polymers as well.\n",

      "We note that recently Xi et al.175 proposed a universal formula to calculate the thermal conductivity of materials ranging from crystals to amorphous polymers. For amorphous polymers, the formula leverages a network theory developed by Zhou et al.176 In their physical picture, the amorphous polymer system is treated as a percolation network of segments of polymer chains. Heat conduction depends on the density and interaction strength of the connection points in the network. It was assumed that the heat transfer efficiency is determined by the van der Waals (vdW) interaction between the segments connected to each connection point. The model could explain well the universal low thermal conductivity in amorphous polymers and its temperature and pressure dependence. However, questions remain on why the segments connected to each point have the same heat transfer efficiency that is dictated by vdW interactions, while at least two of the four segments are connected by covalent bonds. As discussed previously, molecular simulations have shown that thermal transport along the covalent backbone usually dominates even in the amorphous phase. It is possible that if such local bonding anisotropy can be implemented, the model may reach higher quantitative accuracy. Alternatively, maybe some effective connection point density should be used other than the actual physical connection point density since polymer chains in the molecular level are almost closely packed.\n",

      "Many polymers are semi-crystalline and this could have effects on the apparent MFP, l, since heat carriers traveling in the crystal domains would be subject to less structural disorder scattering and thus have longer l, which will lead to higher thermal conductivity. Hattori177 found a linear relationship between thermal conductivity of polytrifluorochloroethylene (PCTFE) and the degree of crystallinity at room temperature (Fig. 13b). He made an argument that when there were more crystalline domains in the polymer, the effective MFP of heat carriers were larger and thus the thermal conductivity increased when considering the phonon gas model (i.e., K = cvl/3). Crystallization can happen spontaneously given proper heat treatment (e.g., annealing). In such cases, the thermal conductivity would still be isotropic since the crystallites orients randomly. As discussed previously in Section 2.4, crystallites orientation can be forced via extrusion or drawing, which induces shear to the internal structure of polymers (Fig. 13a). Even with small draw ratios, experimental characterization has shown that crystallinity can be high and crystalline lamellae will start to align well in the draw direction.178, 179 Further drawing will stretch the tie molecules between the lamellae and pull out crystalline blocks. When the drawing ratio further increases, these crystalline blocks will further align along the draw direction.152\n",

      "As shown in Fig. 13c, it is interesting to find out that even with low draw ratio (~5), the crystallinity of the polymer is already 0.9, where the thermal conductivity is around 2 W/mK.38 Further increasing the draw ratio to over 100 in thin films only increase the crystallinity slightly, but the thermal conductivity increase is tremendous to ~ 60 W/mK.110 Ultra-drawing fibers into nanofibers was shown to further increase the thermal conductivity to ~100 W/mK.4 However, the room for crystallinity increase is small after certain draw ratios (~5), and it has been found that the crystallite orientation along the draw direction also saturates after relatively low draw ratio of ~10,110 after which thermal conductivity continued to increase by 10 folds (Fig. 13c, purple crosses). SAXS (Small-angle X-ray scattering) and WAXS (Wide-angle X-ray scattering) analyses indicated that increasing the draw ratio beyond ~10 will lead to the decrease in the amorphous volume fraction, which effectively increases crystallinity, but such increase is not significant. Thus, this could still not explain the high thermal conductivity increase. Using a serial thermal resistance model, the authors concluded that the thermal conductivity of the amorphous portion is increasing when the draw ratio increases, and at a draw ratio of ~110, the amorphous thermal conductivity is calculated to be around 15 W/mK.110 It was noted that the amorphous region is not crystallized but chains are somewhat orientated. Lu et al.,64 using MD simulations to study semi-crystalline PE, found the thermal conductivity of the amorphous region needed to be modified due to the bridge (tie) molecules between the two neighboring crystallites in order to properly describe the semi-crystalline PE thermal conductivity especially at high crystallinities (>83%). The thermal conductivity of semi-crystalline PE depends on the number of tie molecules bridging the crystallites. It might also be possible that after the tie molecules are stretched, their chain segments along the backbone become more ordered, which is critical to enhancing thermal transport\n",

      "Speed of sound has been another important factor that has been commonly linked to polymer thermal conductivity (i.e., K = cvl/3), besides heat capacity and MFP. Sound speed is related to the modulus of materials and thus we usually see harder materials having higher thermal conductivity. For example, diamond and cubic BN, the hardest materials, are known to have among the highest thermal conductivity in nature. 182, 183 Modulus can be measured from conventional tensile mechanical test, which can be used to calculate speed of sound. Speed of sound can also be measured directly using acoustic echoes in pump- probe measurements where thermal conductivity can be characterized in the same experiment.146 Figure 14 shows some experimental and MD thermal conductivity data for polymers as a function of the average speed of sound. Here, the average speed of sound is calculated as Vave = 1/3(V[+2V1), where V1 and Vrare respectively the speeds of the longitudinal and transverse acoustic modes (i.e., phonon group velocities at Brillouin Zone center). As can be seen, there is a generally increasing trend of thermal conductivity against the average speed of sound. Data shown in Fig. 14 are also tabulated in Table 3.\n",

      "However, there are doubts on the accuracy of using speed of sound to describe the heat carrier traveling speed. Heat carriers in disordered structures have a wide frequency spectrum and only those with very low frequencies (i.e., long wavelength) can be reasonably assigned with the speed of sound as their traveling speed. For those intermediate frequency and higher frequency modes, they should have lower traveling speed. It might be reasonable to use K = cvl/3 or its variations for very low temperature thermal conductivity when long wavelength phonons dominate. At higher temperatures, the dominant frequency shifts to a higher region, which should have lower traveling speed compared to low frequency modes. It was pointed out that only at very low temperature (<1 K), heat capacity approaches the value predicted on the basis of the sound velocity.185 Allen and Feldman186 categorized the heat carriers in amorphous materials into three kinds depending on their nature: propagons (phonon-like propagating wave delocalized over large distances), diffusons (extended vibration modes delocalized over a short distances) and locons (highly localized modes). Depending on temperature, morphology and materials, these modes can contribute differently to heat conduction. In terms of population, the diffusons and locons are the majority. According to Allen and Feldman's calculation, diffusons, rather than the long wavelength propagons, are by far the most dominant heat carriers at room temperatures.186 Diffusons transport fundamentally differently from propagons since they transfer energy via diffusion-like mechanism between extended but non-propagating modes, a picture that is different from the phonon gas model. Alexander et al. described transport of such non-propagating modes as anharmonic coupling.187 187 Lv et al. 174 showed that diffusons can also correlate to locons so that the energy of locons can be effectively transferred spatially with the help of diffusons. It is hard to rationalize that these diffusons or locons would travel with speed of sound, and their transport might be better described by a correlation picture.188 However, another recent study showed that propagons were the dominant contributors to thermal conductivity in amorphous silicon,189 and these modes are mainly\n",

      "As discussed previously, while polymers share similar low temperature thermal conductivity behavior since they all behave like an elastic medium to support long wavelength transport, their higher temperature thermal conductivity becomes diverse in temperature dependency and amplitude. The above discussion has eluded such differences to the inherent chemistry of different polymers. In our opinion, the ability to correlate chemistry of polymers and their thermal conductivity is the crown-jewel of this field since it would provide the ultimate guidance needed for materials by design. Chemistry of the polymer directly determines the atomic mass and bonding natures, which further influences the conformation of chains, density, the ability to form crystal structures, interatomic interaction, heat capacity, speed of sound, etc. As mentioned in Hands et al.'s work in 1973,151 research efforts had aimed to provide chemists and engineers with assistance to predict the thermal conductivity of a polymer given their chemical nature, such as molecular weight, degree of branching and crosslinking, stereoregularity, crystallization, defects (voids and structural irregularities), and molecular orientation, together with external parameters like temperature and pressure. It is fair to say that important physics has been understood along the way, but the ability to precisely predict thermal conductivity based on chemistry still needs much work. However, we are seeing increased efforts in recent years to achieve understanding of the correlation between the chemical composition of a polymer and their bulk thermal conductivity. In this section, we discuss works that have helped unravel the chemistry-thermal conductivity relation.\n",

      "Relating thermal conductivity to even the simplest chemistry feature, the chain length (i.e., degree of polymerization), has not been straightforward. Early experiments by Hansen et al.194 on PE found that the thermal conductivity of amorphous polymers scaled with the square root of the molecular weight for short chains and converges when the chain lengths are sufficiently long. The observed relation was k x VMw when Mw < 100,000. Since then, this trend of thermal conductivity increasing with Mw was also observed in other types of polymers, such as PMMA,195 polystyrene (PS), 196 and polycaprolactam (PCL).197 For sufficiently long chains, Fesciyan et al.198 derived a model for thermal conductivity based on the Green- Kubo formula for high molecular weight polymer melts, but the derived formula was not a function of chain length. However, for shorter chains, models show diverse trends. The first model in the literature that relates thermal conductivity to molecular weight is Weber's equation for liquids, 168 K = McCpMw3p3, where Mc is 1 4 related to the material property, cp is the specific heat at constant pressure, Mw is the molecular weight and p is the mass density. According to this equation, thermal conductivity would scale with the chain length to the 1/3 power since molecular weight is linear to the degree of polymerization for the same polymer. This power, however, deviates from the experimentally observed K & Mw for short PEs.194 There were also other models suggesting an inverse relationship against molecular weight, k « (-1-)ª, where a was 0.3 (Ref. [199]) or 0.5 (Ref. [200]). These examples show the difficulty in developing a physical understanding that can relate the thermal conductivity to the polymer chemistry in amorphous polymers.\n",

In this study, they developed a method to decompose the thermal conductivity into contributions from different inter-atomic interactions (bonding and non-bonding interactions) and molecular advection. They found that as chain length increases, the contribution of intra-chain bonding interaction increases\n",

For C24H50, intra-chain bonding forces contribute ~ 50% of total thermal conductivity, compared to ~30% from non-bonding interactions and ~20% from advection. This is an important result since it implies that thermal transport along the chain can be as important as, if not more important than, non-bonding interactions - a critical difference between polymers, simple liquids (little intra-chain contribution) and inorganic amorphous materials (purely bonding interaction). Another study from Ohara's group202 found that the thermal conductivity of PAA increases with chain length due to the enhanced intra-molecular interactions. The same group203 later compared linear alcohol and linear alkane with different chain lengths, and found that thermal conductivity of alcohol was uniformly larger than alkane for the same chain lengths, but the thermal conductivity of both materials seems to converge as chain length increases. This was attributed to the contribution from the polar hydroxyl end groups in alcohol, which enhanced inter-molecular interaction. As the chain length increases, the role of end groups decreases and thus the two thermal conductivity results converge. Zhao et al.204 studied the thermal conductivity dependence on chain length in amorphous PE using MD simulations with the chain length from 4 to 1260. The calculated thermal conductivity increases initially and then reaches a plateau at higher degree of polymerization - the same trend seen in experiments. They found that there was a clear correlation between morphology and thermal conductivity, and the major differentiator is the phase of the polymer (gas, gas-liquid, and liquid) due to different chain lengths.\n",

      "Some recent studies have pointed out that polymer chain conformation is a key factor influencing thermal conductivity even if the materials are in purely amorphous states. These are mainly understood by detailed MD simulations. As mentioned previously, an important feature of polymers compared to inorganic amorphous materials is their local anisotropic bonding environment consisting of both covalent bonding and non-bonding interactions like vdW and electrostatic interactions. It has been shown that in amorphous polymers, thermal transport along the chain backbone via the strong covalent bonds contributes more than those non-bonding interactions to thermal conductivity (see Fig. 12b). In recent MD simulations, Luo and coworkers have shown that the thermal conductivity of amorphous polymer is closely related to the chain conformation. 111, 128, 206 It has been observed that thermal transport along the covalent chain backbone is related to the chain conformation, especially its spatial extension as characterized by the radius of gyration (Rg).111 Through a parametric study using MD simulations, the Rg of a model PE is systematically tuned by changing its dihedral angle energy constant.111 As the dihedral angle is strengthened, there will be less segmental rotation along the chain and then the persistence length of the chains becomes larger, which in turn lead to larger Rg (Fig. 15a). While there is no direct proof, it is reasonable to think that larger Rg would allow heat transfer along the chains to reach longer spatial distantances before getting interrupted by chain ends. As seen in Fig. 15b, the PE with larger Rg has larger thermal conductivity contributed from the intra- chain bonding interactions. Such a finding indicating a positive correlation between Rg and thermal conductivity was not only observed for homopolymers,111 but was also generalized to polymer blends128 and bi-/tri-block copolymers20 (Fig. 15c).\n",

In addition to the strong backbone, the authors also argued that the strong T-T stacking facilitated inter-chain thermal transport. In a recent simulation study (not yet published), we observe that the T-T stacking does not directly enhance thermal transport across chains, but instead, it helps straighten chains and lead to enhanced intra-chain thermal transport along the covalent backbone.\n",

      "linear side chains (PBDTTT-DD) exhibits a thermal conductivity that is 160% higher than that with shorter and bulkier branched side chains (PBDTTT-EE) (Fig. 16a). The SAXS and gazing incident X-ray scattering (GIXS) characterizations show that polymers with long side chains tend to have higher crystallinity and larger crystal sizes, but the reason is not currently clear.208 When such factors are considered, we were able to explain the thermal conductivity difference between the DD and the rest types of polymers using the effective medium approximation143, 209 (squares, Fig. 16b). However, it was not until we also considered the inter-molecular distance separated by the side chains (d-spacing, Fig. 16b) in the amorphous phase that we were able to reproduce the thermal conductivity trend over the whole range (triangles, Fig. 16b). This implies that not only can global morphology influence thermal transport but, in amorphous polymers, the local molecular morphologies are also important. Much fundamental research is still needed to completely understand the chain conformation effect on thermal conductivity. This will be a great challenge in this field and will be highly rewarding since it may be the critical stepstone to achieving designing thermally conductive polymers with rational chemistry selection. Tackling such a challenge, in our opinion, will require a strong collaboration between experiments, characterization, molecular simulations and potentially machine learning techniques.\n",

      "According to effective medium theory, in a binary mixture of two polymers the thermal conductivity would vary monotonically as the fraction of one component changes. For example, Morikawa et al.210 showed that the thermal diffusivity of poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) and polystyrene (PS) binary blends increase almost linearly from 1.13 to 1.63 x 10-7 m2/s, when the PPO ratio increases from 0 to 100 wt%. Another study from the same group211 also showed that polymer blends of poly(ethylene-co-cyclohexane 1,4-dimethanol terephthalate) (PETG) and bisphenol-A polycarbonate (PC) had a monotonic trend when the PC content increases, although the trend was not linear. A recent report212 showed that the thermal conductivity of a blend made of PC and ethylene-propylene copolymer (EPC) with 10 wt% PC was ~ 0.206 W/mK, between that of PC (0.240 W/mK) and PE (0.166 W/mK). Duda et al.213 studied the thermal conductivity of P3HT:PCBM blends, and found it to have a linear relationship with the P3HT concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also indications that the thermal conductivity in polymer blends cannot be simply described by the effective medium theory. In 2014, Guo et al.214 observed that the binary mixture of a fullerene derivative and a conjugated polymer had a minimum thermal conductivity of ~0.06 W/mK at 30-35 vol% of the conjugated polymer, which was even lower than that of the pure fullerene derivative (~0.07 W/mK).\n",
      "\n",
      "This observation was potentially related to phase segregation, which has not yet been fully understood. In 2016, Kim et al.10 reported that the polymer blend of poly(N-acryloyl piperidine) (PAP) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) could reach a thermal conductivity as high as 1.5 W/mK at 30% molar fraction of PAP. This high thermal conductivity was unprecedented and was about an order of magnitude higher than that of common amorphous polymers. The mechanism was explained as that the interchain hydrogen bonds between PAP and PAA molecules created a homogeneous network that enhanced thermal transport. It is worth mentioning that the authors also observed non-monotonic relation between thermal conductivity and blending ratios for another two blends, PAP-PVA and PAP-PVPh.

      "\n",
      "blends (< 0.4 W/mK) were much smaller than that of the unique PAP-PAA blend. On the other hand, an independent research by Xie et al.146 reported that PAP and PAA could not form a homogeneous blend, and that PVA-PAA blends did not show an extraordinary thermal conductivity value at intermediate mixing ratios, even though they contained some interchain hydrogen bonds. Even if a homogeneous hydrogen bond network could form, the extremely high thermal conductivity of ~1.5 W/mK would be surprising, since in a similar vein, cross-linking, which forms homogeneous covalent bond networks led to even lower thermal conductivity for PAA (from 0.37 to 0.28 W/mK).146\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, Bruns et al.215 used MD simulations to find that PAP and PAA were immiscible at any mixing ratio, and that the PAP-PAA blend showed almost invariant thermal conductivity as the mixing ratio changed. They also reported that polyacrylamide (PAM)-PAA blends had a maximum thermal conductivity of~0.42 W/mK at the 40% monomer molar fraction of PAM, which was attributed to that the PAM created more bridges for the major polymer PAA through interchain hydrogen bonds. However, this argument can also be countered by the lack of thermal conductivity improvement in cross-linked PAA.146 Bruns et al. also believed that the thermal conductivity improvement by blending PAM and PAA was related to the increase in stiffness (bulk modulus) due to the hydrogen bond network. However, another experimental study216 showed that due to the interchain hydrogen bond network formation by adding water, the thermal conductivity of PVA and its blends could be enhanced from 0.3-0.4 W/mK to ~0.7 W/mK, despite the significant decrease in modulus after these polymers were moisturized. Wei et al.128 studied the effects of interchain and intrachain interactions between the blending polymers by artificially tuning the interchain and intrachain interaction strengths in a model MD simulation. It was found that increasing the interchain interaction could enhance thermal conductivity, but it was due to the polymer chains in the major phase being stretched (i.e., Rg increased) and the heat flux through bonding interaction being enhanced.\n",

      "The above text focused on charge neutral polymers. The charges and highly polarized groups in polyelectrolytes, which result in strong Coulombic interactions, add another level of complexity to the thermal transport mechanism. In polyelectrolytes, due to the strong Coulombic interactions, the electrostatic forces can directly enhance thermal transport via stronger inter-molecular interactions or it may enhance thermal transport by changing the chain conformation. Shanker et. al.217 showed that at high pH the ionized PAA can reach a thermal conductivity value up to ~1.2 W/mK, and they suggested that such an enhancement is related to the electrostatic interaction between the polarized groups on the same polymer chain backbone helping stretch the polymer backbones, which in turn increase the thermal transport along the chain - similar to the effect of enhanced Rg. However, Xie et. al.145 found that the highest thermal conductivity of various polyelectrolytes, including PAA, was not more than ~0.67 W/mK. According to the counterion condensation theory, bulk amorphous polyelectrolytes tend to have a collapsed chain conformation, i.e., Rg would decrease.218-220 This thus contradicts with the mechanism proposed by Shanker et. al.217 In recent MD simulations, 169, 184 it was found that thermal conductivity would indeed increase as the ionization increases (from ~0.30 to ~0.67 W/mK, Fig. 17a), with the level of increase close to that found in experiments. 145, 217 However, the simulations failed to find obvious increase in Rg as a function of ionization, but instead found that the thermal conductivity increase could be largely attributed to the counterion-polymer electrostatic interaction. Even if with an artificial increase in the Rg of fully ionized PAA from ~12.3 to ~16.1 Å through increasing the dihedral angle strength, the thermal conductivity only slightly increased from ~0.67 to ~0.70 W/mK.169\n",

The Coulombic force does not directly contribute to heat transfer, but it attracts oppositely charged atoms closer, which in turn increases LJ forces between significantly, especially the LJ repulsive force ( xr-12 ) (Fig. 17d). The molecular-level understanding is that the enhanced Coulombic interaction between the ionized polymer functional groups and counterions attracts them closer together, and the LJ interaction transitions from attractive to repulsive (Fig. 17e), which is evident from Fig. 17b showing the LJ potential changes from positive to negative when ionization level increases. Since the repulsive portion of the LJ potential is much steeper than the attractive portion (i.e., larger force amplitude) (Fig. 17e), being in the repulsive region would greatly enhance thermal conductivity which can be expressed as the product of the interatomic force and the atomic velocity in the molecular level.\n",

      "In polyelectrolytes with different types of counterions, the ionic charges and radii are different, which directly impact the counterion-counterion, counterion-polymer and polymer-polymer interactions. These will further influence thermal conductivity. Both experimental study145 and MD simulation184 show that thermal conductivity of common polyelectrolytes are all < 0.7 W/mK. Based on the MD simulation results, using a machine learning tool, Random Forest, the feature importance of different descriptors (atomic mass, atomic radii, vdW radii and ionic radii) associated with the counterions was quantified.184 The ionic radius emerged to have the strongest relationship with thermal conductivity, although PAA itself was an outlier (Fig. 18a). This finding might be interpreted as that when the ionic radius increases, the pairwise force decreases, and as a result, the thermal conductivity decreases. With physical reasoning, a combined parameter, n2 FLJdRDF/Vm, which was derived from the molecular-level heat flux, was proposed. This combined parameter involves the equilibrium LJ force (FLJ), atomic mass (m), number density (n) and RDF peak location ( dRDF ), and can describe a positive relationship between counterions and thermal conductivity (Fig. 18b). Such a combined parameter shed the light on the complexity of how ions could impact thermal conductivity. Thermal transport mechanism in polyelectrolytes is still not fully understood, and the possibility of making polyelectrolytes thermal conductivity > 1 W/(m.K) remains to be verified. The important aspects that can affect the thermal conductivity of polyelectrolytes are polymer chain\n",

      "Using MD simulations, Zhang et al.66 has shown that thermal conductivity of a PE crystal fiber can be regulated reversibly through temperature, mechanical strain or their combinations. In crystalline PE fibers, thermal transport is dominated by propagating phonons, and their MFP and thus thermal conductivity is very sensitive to the segmental disorder along the chains. The energy constant of the dihedral angle, which controls the segmental rotation, is on the order of ~0.1 kcal/mol - ~ 0.8kBT for room temperature. This means that thermal energy in the intermediate temperature range would be sufficient to overcome the dihedral angle energy barrier to enable segmental rotation (Fig. 19a). The ground state of the dihedral angle of PE is at 180º (trans conformation), but there are metastable states at angles of 60° and 300° (gauche conformation), and the emergence of the gauche conformation can happen within an extremely narrow temperature window of 2 K (Fig. 19b). By controlling the temperature only, the population of such disorder was able to be controlled and the thermal conductivity could be switched back and forth reversibly with a ratio of ~7 between 300 and 450 K. With the help of strains, which help eliminating the gauche population, the switching ratio could be as large as ~10 between 300 and 450 K and ~6 between 380 and 400 K. Recent experiments by Shrestha et al.12 based on ultra-drawn PE fibers11 successfully realized the MD simulation results, showing record-high solid-state thermal switch with a switching ratio of 10. Such a switchable thermal conductivity of PE was further developed in MD simulations to realize thermal diode with very high rectification factors,65 and experimental validation was recently acheived.223\n",

      "Besides external excitations, some special molecules process intrinsic thermal regulation properties. For example, tapered bottlebrush polymers have asymmetric polymer architecture. They consist of a linear polymer backbone with side chains of systematically varied molecular weights that can be tailored to produce a cone-shaped macromolecule. Using NEMD simulations, Ma and Tian demonstrated that these polymers have the unique ability to generate significant thermal rectification that cannot be rationalized based on conventional wisdom.232 In sharp contrast to all other reported asymmetric nanostructures, they observed that the heat current from the wide end to the narrow end (the forward direction) in tapered bottlebrush polymers is smaller than that in the opposite direction (the backward direction). Further analysis showed that a more disordered to less disordered structural transition within tapered bottlebrush polymers is essential for generating nonlinearity in heat conduction for thermal rectification. Moreover, the thermal rectification ratio increased with device length, reaching as high as ~70% with a device length of 28.5 nm as shown in Fig. 20. This large thermal rectification with strong length dependence uncovered an unprecedented phenomenon-diffusive thermal transport in the forward direction and ballistic thermal transport in the backward direction. This is the first observation of a switching between different heat transfer regions as the heat flow direction flips. The fundamentally new knowledge gained from this study may spark interest into intrinsic thermal rectification in asymmetric polymer molecules. Future work to scale up the single molecule rectification would be needed to drive practical applications.\n",

It would be intuitive to believe that it is the strong Coulombic interaction that led to the enhanced thermal conductance compared to non-polar interfaces. However, detailed thermal conductance decomposition into contributions from different interactions and structure characterization near the interface suggest that the enhanced conductance was a collaborative effect from vdW and Coulombic interactions. It was found that Coulombic forces attract the organic molecules closer to the interface, which in turn increased the force from vdW interactions. Interestingly, it turned out that vdW was the direct contributor to the thermal conductance enhancement while Coulombic was helping in an indirect manner.28, 242 Such a molecular thermal transport picture is similar to that found in bulk polyelectrolytes as discussed in Section 3.5.4.\n",

One possible picture is that anharmonic channels via inelastic scattering helped distribute phonon energy from the Au to the SAM vibrational spectrum, and such energy transfer efficiency is related to the strong covalent bonds between Au and SAM. The energy transferred to the SAM spectrum from Au could then be transferred to the PE side via strong harmonic coupling due to almost perfect spectra overlap.

Further analyses indicated that the change in surface morphology did not really change the vibrational spectra of the local atoms much (inset in Fig. 22b). It is possible that the nature of the heat carriers will change from propagating phonons to modes like diffusons when the Si surface is changed into amorphous structures, and such a heat carrier nature is more similar to that in the amorphous PDMS, which somehow lead to better energy exchange across the interfaces. However, this hypothesis has not yet been tested and further study is needed.

However, these studies are largely phenomenological. Models252, 253 have been proposed to include anharmonic channels (inelastic scattering) for predicting interfacial thermal conductance, but they are significantly simplified. For example, the only inelastic channels considered were the processes that n phonons with the same frequency @ scatter simultaneously to generate a phonon with frequency no. In recent years, MD simulations on solid-solid interfaces have pointed to the fact that scattering of heat carriers prior to reaching the interface can help re- distribute phonon energy to a state that is preferred for harmonic coupling across the interface.254-256 Such pre-interface scattering is not limited to anharmonic scattering254 but also defect scattering.255 Could the SAM layer and the amorphous surface in the above-discussed examples have played similar roles in enhancing thermal transport across hard-soft interfaces? Further studies are needed to answer this question. MD simulation remains to be the ideal tool to answer such a question since it inherently includes anharmonicity, structure disorder and defects.

      "A detailed study of heat carrier modes and their transport properties are still to be done to better understand the thermal transport physics in polymers. While Allen and Feldman186, 262 have proposed a physical picture of heat carriers in disordered materials, and recent simulation and experimental studies have furthered the understanding, 189, 263-267 their theory has rarely been applied to polymers. The only application of the Allen-Feldman picture to polymers we are aware of is from Shenogin et al.192 on amorphous PS. It showed that hardly any modes were propagons and modes above 5 THz were all locons, although the whole vibrational spectra could extend to ~90 THz. The large population of localized modes were attributed to the rigidity of PS chains, which would result in relatively high frequency vibrations. The thermal conductivity obtained from the Allen-Feldman theory were significantly lower than MD simulation results at temperatures above 100 K, and even the trends did not agree with one another.192 Anharmonicity was considered as the possible factor for such a discrepancy, but the authors also noted that it was puzzling to find the MD yielded lower thermal conductivity than the Allen-Feldman theory, which is purely harmonic. Indeed, Alexander et al.187 described the transport of non-propogating modes via an anharmonic coupling picture, and Lv et al.174 used MD simulation to show that locons could contribute to thermal transport through anharmonic coupling with diffusons. While these were for inorganic materials, a similar physical picture could apply to polymers, which of course, needs verification. The ideal tool would be normal mode analysis188 in MD simulations which inherently include anharmonic effect and captures realistic polymer structures and interactions. However, challenges exist in such studies for polymer, since in modal analysis, atomic vibration needs to be projected on to the eigenvectors of the normal modes that are determined from diagonalizing the dynamical matrix constructed from interatomic force constants at the ground state of the system. The ability of using modal decomposition for inorganic material lies in the fact that all atoms are vibrating around their equilibrium throughout the course of simulation, and thus the\n",

      "eigenvectors, determined from their ground state coordinates, do not change over time. For polymers, however, this could become very tricky since it is very difficult to relax the atoms to their global ground state since the movements of atoms are highly restricted by the bonding and non-bonding interactions as well as stereo-hinderance. As a result, when doing lattice dynamics, it is very likely that atoms are in metastable positions and some eigen-frequencies are negative. This would impose questions on the validity of the eigenvector to which the atomic coordinates need to be projected onto. In addition, during the simulation where atomic trajectory is tracked, the atoms can drift significantly, moving away from the initial equilibrium position. Normal mode analysis is inherently based on perturbation theory, and such large movement away from the equilibrium may invalidate this assumption meant to deal with small perturbations. Actually, according to the two-level system picture from Anderson et al.162 and Phillips163, it is indeed very likely that atoms would hop between metastable states back and forth (see inset schematic in Fig. 11a).\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, a key difference between polymer and inorganic amorphous materials is the locally anisotropic bonding. How would the modes transfer energy within the polymer chain through the strong bonding and across chains via weaker non-bonding interactions would be a unique question for polymer thermal transport. It would be intuitive to think that the diffusons transfer energy more efficiently along the covalent backbone and less so across chains, but why cross-linking, which forms covalent bonds between chains, turned out to reduce thermal conductivity (e.g., PAA - 0.37 W/mK to cross-linked PAA - 0.28 W/mK146)? Is it possible that the passing of the diffusons is accompanied by the anharmonic energy communication with locons along the way? If propagons are not important in thermal transport in polymers as found by Shenogin et al.192, would the use of K = cvl/3,153 or its different variants be questionable? How much can we truly borrow from the understanding of thermal transport in disordered inorganics267 to explore polymer thermal transport? We believe these are only a fraction of the fundamental questions that are worth answering, but tools do not yet exist to fully explore them.\n",

      "Besides the motivation to pursue the fundamental science, an overarching goal of studying thermal transport physics in polymer is to provide engineers with a reliable tool to predict the thermal conductivity of a polymer given its chemical nature, or to give chemists and material scientists the guidance to design a polymer based on the needed thermal conductivity to realize the so-called material-by-design. We are currently far from attaining these capabilities, although some pieces of advice can be extracted from past studies. There are so many factors, including polymer chemistry, morphology, processing conditions and etc., that can impact thermal conductivity. Obviously, establishing a model that links all these parameters to thermal conductivity is impractical given that the physics is not fully elucidated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Materials Informatics using machine learning (ML) techniques is an important component towards the eventual realization of material-by-design.268 ML has been recently applied to thermal conductivity,269 especially for designing inorganic semiconductors with low thermal conductivity, mainly motivated by the demand of high performance thermoelectrics.270-273 However, Materials Informatics concerning polymers (i.e., Polymer Informatics) has been hindered by the lack of data in a unified format.274 For example, the largest open polymer database, PolyInfo, only has < 80 thermal conductivity data, let alone that these data contain uncertainties. Unlike inorganic crystals which have well-defined lattice structures, it is also challenging to produce large datasets for amorphous polymers using high-throughput simulations due to the uncertainty and difficulty in generating reasonable amorphous structures. Polymer has not yet been a focus of national and international initiatives like the Materials Genome program, making the data growth slow in the foreseeable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent study, ML techniques was used to construct a surrogate model between polymer chemistry represented by SMILES (Simplified molecular-input line-entry system) strings and thermal conductivity.275 Interestingly, they were able to obtain a deep neural network (DNN) model with reasonable accuracy (R2=0.73) using merely 28 training data points in thermal conductivity available from the PolyInfo database. This was realized by implementing a novel technique called Transfer Learning, which \"transfers\" Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review. 70\n",
      "\n",
      "knowledge learned from training against highly populated proxy labels (in their case, ~6000 data points on glass transition temperature, Tg) into constructing DNN for sparsely populated labels (i.e., thermal conductivity). By directly training a DNN against the 28 thermal conductivity data, R2 was -0.4 (i.e., no prediction power), but Transfer Learning helped improve the model accuracy to R2=0.73. The essence of Transfer Learning is that different properties are different expressions of the inherent chemistry of materials. However, the transferred DNN is still much inferior compared to the model for the highly populated label, Tg (R2=0.92). It is our belief that Transfer Learning can further improve the model accuracy if more thermal conductivity labels can be leveraged in the training, and this has been shown in a recent work on inorganic crystals.276 Some authors of the present review article are currently dedicating efforts to generate a large thermal conductivity database through high-throughput MD simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Tg might not be the only proxy label that can be used for Transfer Learning. Other intermediate labels, such as Rg, modulus, effective charges, and even force field parameters,277 which can be calculated more quickly than thermal conductivity, may also provide a bridge to construct more accurate thermal conductivity surrogate models via Transfer Learning. Besides ML models, recent findings showed that properly representing polymer molecules can be important for constructing accurate surrogate models, since representations describe the chemistry of molecules.278 It was found that a deep learning representation scheme (i.e., Mol2Vec) based on the Natural Language Process (NLP) algorithm was better than the conventionally used Morgan Fingerprint, a one-hot encoding scheme based on the simple chemical connections. Even if a chemistry-thermal conductivity relation can be identified from ML, properly including processing conditions as descriptors could be another obstacle for eventually validating the model prediction, as processing conditions can impact the morphology which in turn influence thermal conductivity. Processing conditions are not something that can be easily modeled, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are just a small portion of the important aspects of polymer informatics. It is our hope that there will be a collective effort from different communities (e.g., thermal, polymer, ML) to take on this problem in a holistic manner to simultaneously explore different aspects of this field (e.g., database, molecular Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review. 71\n",
      "\n",
      "representation, ML models, MD modeling, and experimental validation) to advance it. If a chemistry- processing-property relationship is eventually established, the benefit would be beyond realizing material- by-design, as such a relation can also facilitate identifying the most influential parameters (e.g., hydrogen bonds, It-T stacking, conjugation) that impact thermal conductivity. This would guide more targeted experimental and simulation studies to reveal specific aspects of the underlying physics.\n",

      "The intent to use polymers for heat transfer application is not because they can conduct heat better than metals or semiconductors, but instead, is motivated by their other superior properties compared to these better thermal conductors. For example, plastic heat exchangers are more chemically resistive, lighter- weight and cheaper than metallic ones. Polymers are softer than metals so they are used as thermal interface materials to filled the gaps between rough surfaces in electronic packages.2 Polymers are ideal for solid- state electrolytes, improving their thermal conductivity helps heat dissipation and thus safety.279 Because of the application requirements, designing polymers with desired thermal conductivity is always constrained by their other properties. For example, loading metallic fillers into polymer matrices for thermal conductivity improvement limits their application in electronics due to short circuiting concerns. Adding excessive fillers also hardens polymers, impairing their ability to fill gaps. Materials informatics with multi- objective optimization can be a valuable tool to balance different design targets for different applications.280\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides tuning polymer thermal conductivity as a secondary property for given applications, we have also recently seen studies taking advantages of the unique thermal conductivity of polymers to realize new functionalities. Thermal regulation using polymers is certainly one such example that leverages the high sensitivity of thermal transport to polymer morphologies (see Section 4). Thermally conductive polymer fibers are also being explored for wearables to help body temperature regulation, energy harvesting and sensing.281, 282 Organic thermoelectric materials have also attracted research attention since they inherently have low thermal conductivity to start with.283 With novel applications, we hope to see thermal conductivity Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review. 72\n",

      "\"Any consideration of thermal conductivity, particularly in the context of amorphous polymers, is restricted by three principal factors. The first is the present lack of understanding of the nature of molecular organization in the amorphous, or so-called amorphous, state, whether a material is in the overt liquid or supercooled glassy phase. The second is the absence of any precise working theory for such a material, and the third is the paucity of data, coupled with some uncertainty in the reliability of even this. The latter represents the experimental difficulties associated with the measurement of thermal conductivity, although figures are usually available to two significant figures on most commercially available polymers.\" This is quoted from Hands' 1973 paper.151 The first two restricting factors certainly remains true up to date, although accurately measuring polymer thermal conductivity can now be achieved using various techniques. The first factor is related to the chemistry-property relationships, while the second one calls for better models to describe the heat carrier transport physics. With this review, we hope to summarize the advancements in thermal transport physics in polymers and point out places where more research is needed. The underlying physics of thermal transport in crystalline fibers resemble a lot to that in inorganic lattices, but thermal transport in amorphous polymers is certainly a different scenario despite its similarity to amorphous inorganics. It is our belief that we are still far from completely understanding the complicated chemistry-property relationship for amorphous polymers. We hope there will be a collective effort from different communities to leverage different tools, including simulation, experiments and machine learning, to work towards better understanding polymer thermal transport.\n",

      "There has been rapidly growing demand of polymeric materials coming from differ- ent aspects of modern life because of the highly diverse physical and chemical proper- ties of polymers. Polymer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to exploit existing polymer data for efficient design of functional polymers. Despite many potential benefits of employing a data-driven approach to polymer de- sign, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics\n",

      "\n",
      "attributed to the complex hierarchical structures of polymers, such as the lack of open databases and unified structural representation. In this study, we review and discuss the applications of machine learning on different aspects of the polymer design process through four perspectives: polymer databases, representation (descriptor) of polymers, predictive models for polymer properties, and polymer design strategy. We hope that this paper can serve as an entry point for researchers interested in the field of polymer informatics.\n",

      "Polymers are one of the most important classes of material in modern society, as its applica- tions range from the plastic bags and bottles used in daily life to a variety of electronics, and even structural components in the aerospace industry. A polymer is a material made of a col- lection of chains that are built by connecting many repeated units, called monomers. These chains can form diverse structures that contribute to the highly diverse physical and chemi- cal properties of different types of polymers. Some polymers can be consisting of more than one type of monomer to form even more complicated topological structures across different length scales. The research field of polymer science and engineering emerged to understand, control, and design novel polymers that can be used to satisfy the rapidly growing demand on highly functional materials coming from different aspects of modern life.

      "Following the mainstream of materials science, polymer science has gone through mul- tiple major paradigm shifts. The early studies of polymers flourished in the first half of the 20th century was closely associated with H. Staudinger who received the Nobel Prize in 1953.1 Initially, discovery of polymers was mainly based on an empirical approach, i.e., relying on many trial-and-error experiments. Accumulation of experimental experiences has led to developments of theoretical and simple statistical models for guiding the design of new\n",

      "polymers. These include many important work by the 1974 Nobel prize recipient P. J. Flory, the group contribution method and so on.2-4 Following the rapid advances of computing power in the last few decades, computational methods has become one of the main tools to study properties of polymers.5 Recent developments of simulation techniques for vari- ous types of polymers opened up opportunities to computationally study polymers across different length scales. 6,7 While generating experimental data of polymers is often costly and time-consuming, modern supercomputers provide new opportunities for building larger databases of polymers computationally. With the drastic expansion of data size in science, a data-driven approach for scientific discovery is said to be the 4th paradigm of science. Poly- mer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to mine the precious polymer data for new knowledge. Yet, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics attributed to the complex hierarchical structures of polymers. 8,9\n",

      "Design of a polymer can be broken down into three parts corresponding to the three steps in the typical production process of polymers: design of monomers (polymerization), microstructures (crystallization), and material processing (manufacturing) (see Figure 1). Monomers, the building blocks of polymers, contribute to the foundation of potential prop- erties of the eventually produced polymers. While molecular size is one of the important factors that influences the properties of an organic material, the \"size effect\" of polymers is not directly correlated with the size of the monomers because a large collection of small monomers (e.g., ethylene) can also build long polymer chains the same way large monomers do. Instead, various metrics based on the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of a poly- mer are often used as a reference to relate the \"size of polymer\" to polymer properties. Different polymers built from the same monomer can have different MWD by controlling the polymerization process, which can lead to significantly different physical and chemical properties. 10-12 Furthermore, the collection of polymer chains can form very different crystal structures through a variety of crystallization processes, affecting the material properties of\n",

      "the resulting polymers. For example, Yi et al. controlled the crystallinity and orientation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) molecules to optimize the performance of solar cells. 13 Finally, the same type of polymer in the microscopic scale can undergo different manufacturing pro- cess, such as stretching or mixing additives, to further enhance or alter its properties in order to fulfil specific needs from a broad range of applications. 14 Ideally, the design space of polymers covers all parameters involved in the three production steps, for example, the molecule space of a single or multiple monomer(s) (namely homopolymers or copolymers, respectively), temperature and types of polymerization process, additives or fillers, molding methods, etc. In practice, we often focus on a subset of the parameters while keeping other fixed to reduce the enormous search space. For example, Wu et al. focused on the design of monomer that has a high probability of making liquid crystal polymers with high thermal conductivity after compressed to a polymer thin film. 15\n",

In order to achieve a fully data-driven process of polymer design, continuous efforts have been made to bridge the demand of machine learning technologies and the current state of polymer informatics. In this paper, we review and discuss the applications of machine learning on different aspects of the polymer design process through four perspectives: polymer databases, representation (descriptor) of polymers, predictive models for polymer properties, and polymer design strategy. Illustrative examples are also given using the open- source materials informatics software, XenonPy.18 We hope that this paper can serve as an entry point for researchers interested in the field of polymer informatics, who may be coming from any of the scientific fields covered by polymer informatics.\n",

In other words, it is dangerous to trust the prediction of a model on a material that is not similar to the ones in the training data. Therefore, high quality large database for a diverse set of polymers is always of high demand in polymer informatics. Table 1 shows a list of online databases that contain polymer data.

      "\n",
      "The fundamental purpose of a material descriptor is to uniquely encode materials in a com- pact form in order to allow for efficient machine learning. This is particularly difficult for polymers due to their hierarchical structures. 30 An example of unique representation of polymers would be the Polymer Markup Language, which is designed to include complete information of a polymer ranging from compositional information to all the processing pa- rameters.31 While this representation may be suitable for building polymer databases, it is not compact enough to be used as input of a model for machine learning purposes. In fact, a good material descriptor should consider the tradeoff between ability to uniquely represent a material, easiness to obtain or calculate, and sensitivity to targeted application. 32 In other words, while possible, it is unlikely that a single descriptor can be used for all polymer ap- plications. For example, to search for an efficient polyimide for controlled inkjet deposition, descriptor needs to be sensitive to specific microstructures formed by the polymer chains. 33 On the other hand, designing polymers with certain phase transition properties will require a descriptor that identifies key atomic-level structures. Different level of \"fineness\" of de- scriptor should be selected depending on the physical and chemical properties of interest to the target problem. 34 One example that attempted to capture such hierarchy of descriptor in a Python package is the Materials knowledge systems. 35 Here, we introduce and compare a few descriptors that could be useful in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing conditions of polymers, such as temperature, additives and solvents, can be directly included in a descriptor. Representations of the microstructure and molecular struc- ture of polymer chains are less intuitive. Certain machine learning models in deep learning allow direct use of images as input, but often require a significant amount of data to train the models. 36 Persistant homology is a technique to extract statistical features from topo- logical structures, 37 but its application in polymer informatics is yet to be investigated. Graphical kernel is another option to numerically encode the polymer structures that can be represented in a simple graph. 38 However, finding an efficient graph representation for\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "\n",
      "the complex polymer structures is challenging, especially because different types of polymer chains can form structures in different length scales. Many of the descriptors commonly used in polymer informatics focus on capturing the molecular structure of monomers composing the polymer chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Material descriptors or fingerprints developed for small organic molecules are directly applicable to represent polymers based on their monomers. Modern machine learning al- gorithms also allow direct use of molecular graph or simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) 39 strings as input of a model. 40 Picking a descriptor suitable for the prob- lem of interest may significantly improves the efficiency of machine learning. 34 However, such representation omits information about the chemical bonds between the monomers. An al- ternative is to consider oligmer consisting of n monomers, but there is no clear answer to how to pick n. The larger n is, the more representative the oligmer would be to the polymer. Nevertheless, certain types of descriptors, such as the physical descriptors, will take signifi- cantly longer time to calculate for a larger molecule. Furthermore, some fingerprints could be biased toward polymers with smaller or larger monomers depending on the choice of n. For example, a fingerprint that counts if there are more than 3 benzene rings in a molecule will not be able to distinguish between polystyrene and poly(bisphenol A carbonate) when n > 3. Figure 3 shows how different fingerprints may have different convergence behavior with respect to n. Wu et al. proposed to calculate descriptor of polymers using an infinitely long chain of their corresponding monomers. 19 However, the bias issue for some fingerprints remains unsolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymer chain can be separated into a backbone and its side chains. Distinguishing the two components is theoretically important to predict polymer properties. However, it is not clear how to efficiently encode such information into a general descriptor for different classes of polymers. Similarly, developing descriptors for polymers consisting of more than one type of monomer is still an open challenge. For alternating copolymer, we can simply consider the combined repeating unit of multiple monomers as a \"metamonomer\", but the molecule\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the key components in polymer design is the prediction of polymer properties relevant to a target application. Some of the important properties often considered in the polymer industry include transparency, glass transition temperature, toughness, etc.41 The ability to predict properties of different classes of polymers opens up new computational design approaches for polymers, such as high-throughput screening and inverse design, which will be discussed in the next section. One approach to predict polymer properties is building empirical equations based on physical descriptors and some basic properties of polymers.\n",

      "12\n",
      "\n",
      "An effort to collect such equations in Python has been made by the thermo package. 42 This approach can be very powerful, but could be difficult to use when predicting properties for a new design with not much knowledge available yet. Another approach that is more suitable for design purpose, called the quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) modeling, aims at mapping structural descriptors of a material to its property. In particular, models that rely only on 2D structure information of the polymer is preferred as it avoids intensive geometry optimization for the polymer molecules. To date, around 300 articles can be found on the web of science database when searching with keywords QSPR and polymer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Group contribution method is one of the earliest data-driven approaches to predict com- plex properties of different polymers.3 The basic idea is that certain groups of bonded atoms within different molecules may have common effects on a specific material property. Linear regression is used to model the interaction between groups when data is limited, but higher order models can also be used. Machine learning models using fingerprints as input can be seen as an extension to this idea, since the fingerprints are collections of rules that check the existence of different structural groups. Some commonly used models include elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, Gaussian process, neural network, etc. Table 2 summarizes some recent applications of these algorithms in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning models are inherently interpolative, i.e., their predictions are reliable only around the domain close to the training data. The range of properties prediction for certain types of polymers with a reasonable accuracy governs the potential search space one can cover, i.e., the performance of the final design. In other words, the training data determines the feasible design space of the target application. The concept of applicability domain (AD) developed in Cheminformatics is used to quantify the reliable region of a QSPR model. 49 The concept of uncertainty in statistics is also a popular metric believed to be strongly correlated with the validity of a prediction. 50 Figure 4 shows how different models fail to predict different materials properties when extrapolating from the given data. One idea to tackle this issue is called transfer learning, that is to exploit information learned from\n",

Instead, polymer informatics has been used to improve design effi- ciency within each step of of the polymer design process. For example, Wu et al. discovered new homopolymers with high thermal conductivity that are validated experimentally 15 and Li et al. developed an algorithm that discovers optimal strategy to experimentally control MWDs of various polymers.22 There are three types of design strategies based on machine learning technology: high-throughput screening, inverse design, and experimental design.

Sampling methods can have a higher chance to provide diverse candidates, but can also be trapped in a local mode, especial when the search space is high dimensional.

      "approach of polymer design will significantly improve the pace of making new functional polymers, satisfying the rapidly expanding demand on polymeric materials in modern society (e.g., deformable electronic devices74). One of the most important elements of polymer informatics is the availability of large open databases. Building such databases for polymer is challenging because of many reasons: (1) difficulty of encoding the hierarchical structure of polymers for machine learning purposes, (2) inconsistent naming rules throughout the history of polymer science, (3) lack of data sharing due to many privately own industrial data, etc. Nonetheless, this is an essential step towards a fully data-driven design process. Many efforts have been made to build the backbone technologies necessary to exploit the potential benefit of polymer informatics, such as developing new descriptors to better capture the physical properties of polymers and new simulation methods to estimate polymer properties with higher accuracy in a shorter time. The true power of polymer informatics is to release polymer scientists from the low efficiency trial-and-error design process, thus, to free up more time for higher level design concepts and theoretical advancements. Such opportunity can be realized only if we work together to push for a more open community in polymer science, where everyone can benefit from the new paradigm of polymer design. An easy first step to take would be to engage in the field of polymer informatics and experience the new way of studying polymers ourselves.\n",

      "FEEDBACK:\n",
      "The \"TEXT\" section is mostly accurate in reflecting the content of the \"PAPER_CONTENT\" section, with some minor inaccuracies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The \"TEXT\" correctly identifies that the paper is about polymer informatics and machine learning for polymer design, as well as emphasizes the potential of data-driven approaches and the challenges faced in polymer informatics, including the lack of open databases and unified structural representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The paper does not expressly mention \"Stephen Wu and colleagues\" but the authors list does include Stephen Wu as the first author, along with his colleagues. It's a reasonable deduction to attribute the paper to Stephen Wu and his research group, but the phrase \"researchers like Stephen Wu\" is slightly ambiguous when he is the lead author of the discussed paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The \"TEXT\" summarizes the potential and challenges of polymer informatics in a broad sense, but it does not provide specific instances of the application of machine learning techniques, which is detailed in the various sections of the \"PAPER_CONTENT.\" For a complete understanding, it would be beneficial to include these examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary of Potentials and challenges of polymer informatics: exploiting machine learning for polymer design [http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07683v1]:\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper provides an in-depth review of polymer informatics and the application of machine learning (ML) to assist in the design process of polymers. The authors discuss how polymer informatics is an interdisciplinary field that aims to leverage existing polymer data for efficient functional polymer design. The field aims to meet the demands of modern life, which requires polymers with highly diverse properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors outline the challenges in polymer informatics, notably those caused by complex hierarchical polymer structures—such as the scarcity of open databases and the lack of standardized structural representation. Furthermore, they detail the four key aspects of polymer informatics: polymer databases, polymer representation in terms of descriptors, predictive models for property estimation, and concrete polymer design strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper discusses ML's role in informatics, specifically regarding supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and its classification into diverse predictive models catering to polymer properties essential to various industrial applications. The authors also explain the critical role of a comprehensive database, provide an overview of online databases available, and address issues with database size and data bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "In discussing descriptors, the paper points to the difficulty inherent in representing polymers and suggests descriptors that vary depending on the problem of interest. Predictive modeling for polymer properties is considered through various ML techniques and quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) modeling. A discussion on inverse design, high-throughput screening, and experimental design showcases potential ML strategies to assist in developing new polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concluding, the paper emphasizes the need for extensive, high-quality databases of polymers and cooperative efforts toward a more open scientific community in polymer science to realize the potential of polymer informatics fully. The authors acknowledge the financial support that facilitated this research, emphasizing the collaborative nature of the project.\n",

Computationally, the excess chemical potential is calculated using the Widom insertion method, which involves monitoring the change in internal energy as one incrementally introduces individual molecules in the liquid. However, when dealing with dense polymer liquids, inserting long chains requires generating trial configurations with a bias that favors those at low energy on a unit-by-unit basis: a procedure that becomes more challenging as the number of units increases. Thus, calculating the excess chemical potential of dense polymer liquids using this method becomes computationally intractable as the chain length exceeds N ≥ 30. Here, we adopt a coarse-grained model derived from integral equation theory, for which inserting long polymer chains becomes feasible. The Integral Equation theory of Coarse-Graining (IECG) represents a polymer as a sphere or a collection of blobs interacting through a soft potential. We employ the IECG approach to compute the excess chemical potential using Widom's method for polymer chains of increasing lengths, extending up to N = 720 monomers, and at densities reaching up to p = 0.767 g/cm3. From a fundamental perspective, we demonstrate that the excess chemical potentials remain nearly constant across various levels of coarse-graining, offering valuable insights into the consistency of this type of procedure. Ultimately, we argue that current Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, originally designed for atomistic simulations, such as Configurational Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) methods, can significantly benefit from the integration of the IECG approach, thereby enhancing their performance in the study of phase diagrams of polymer liquids.\n",

      "To gain a comprehensive understanding of the thermo- dynamic stability of polymer melts, it is crucial to pre- cisely determine their phase diagram by calculating their chemical potential.1 Nevertheless, conducting an experi- mental investigation to determine the phase diagram of polymer chain melts is often unattainable due to the crit- ical temperature of the polymer melt typically exceeding its degradation temperature. In essence, the polymer degrades before its coexistence curve can be measured. In response, computational modeling has emerged as a solution to determine polymer coexistence curves, effec- tively circumventing the challenges posed by experimen- tal phase diagram determination.2 The isothermal coex- istence of two phases is defined by equal pressure and equal chemical potential in the two phases (Pp(1) = Pp(2) and up(1) = Hp(2)), making accurate numerical calcula- tions of pressure and chemical potential indispensable. Nonetheless, this task can prove to be non-trivial.\n",

      "The theoretical framework for calculating the excess chemical potential as an energy difference was first devel- oped by Ben Widom. In Widom's method, the chemical potential is computed by measuring the difference in in- ternal energy when inserting a 'ghost' molecule into the gas or liquid matrix.2-4 This method is computationally straightforward and easily implemented in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of liquids. However, the one-step inser- tion of the molecule becomes impractical when inserting a sizable molecule, such as a polymer, into a dense liquid, as it is unlikely to be accepted.\n",

      "Throughout the years, various sophisticated compu- tational techniques have been developed to enhance the insertion probability of polymer chains into a dense ma- trix. Among these techniques, the configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) method by Siepmann and cowork- ers has been the most effective.5 In the CBMC method, a polymer chain is gradually inserted into the polymer matrix, one monomer at a time. After placing the first monomer inside the matrix at a random location, the sec- ond monomer is inserted by seeking an unoccupied site within a spatial region surrounding the first monomer. This process is repeated until the entire chain is in-\n",

The CBMC method allows the direct calculation of the excess chemical potential from the chain inser- tion probability, following Rosenbluth statistics.6 Orig- inally developed for a polymer matrix on a lattice, the chain insertion method has been extended to a continuum by de Pablo and coworkers,7 and to extensible chains by Mooij and Frenkel.8 In contrast to Widom's sim- ple direct insertion of the entire molecule in one step,4 the CBMC method offers a higher probability of suc- cessfully inserting the polymer chain. However, as the chain length increases, finding an available site becomes progressively more challenging.9 Consequently, polymers with more than 30 monomers can hardly be inserted into dense polymer melts, leading to limitations in determin- ing the chemical potential for long polymer chains. For instance, Siepmann and colleagues investigated the vapor liquid coexistence curves in samples featuring degrees of polymerization up to N = 16 for both n-alkanes and perfluorinated alkanes. 10,11 More recently, their research extended to examining head-to-head polypropylene up to N = 36 monomers, as well as polypropylene with the same monomer count, alongside poly (ethylene-alt- propylene) consisting of N = 30 monomers.12\n",
      "\n",
      "To enhance the capabilities of MC configurational sampling by chain insertion, several alternative meth- ods have been proposed, including the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method, 13 and the incremental gauge cell method.14 Building upon the CBMC method, Kumar and coworkers focused on solving the incremental chem- ical potential, which represents the increase in excess chemical potential with the addition of a single monomer segment. The intramolecular chemical potential of the full chain is thus calculated segment by segment. No- tably, this potential becomes independent of chain length for chains longer than ten segments. Note that the in- cremental chemical potential was reported for dilute so- lutions of chains with up to 30 monomers, thus for lower densities and shorter chains than those considered in our study.15,16\n",

      "An expanded ensemble method was proposed by Wild- ing and Müller, in which a chain is introduced as a \"permanent penetrable chain\" that is gradually coupled to or decoupled from the matrix by tuning an interac- tion parameter.17 In their 'expanded ensemble simula- tion' polymers were modeled on a lattice using the bond fluctuation model. For an athermal polymer system, they simulated chains with length up to N = 80 at a volume fraction of 0.4, significantly lower than the melt density considered in this study. Additionally, they conducted simulations of thermal polymer chains with degrees of polymerization up to N = 40 at a volume fraction of 0.2. Later, Escobedo and de Pablo introduced the EVA- LENCH method, which combines elements of Müller's expanded ensemble, Kumar's chain increment, and Siep- mann's continuum configurational-bias method. This ap- proach was applied to calculate the chemical potential for tangent hard spheres with 4, 8, 16, and 32 monomers at low densities, and the results aligned with those previ- ously reported by other methods. 18\n",

      "A number of other sophisticated schemes were pro- posed by Theodorou and coworkers to extend particle deletion methods, 19-21 where the excess chemical po- tential was decomposed into an energetic contribution and a volume term related to cavity formation. In the staged particle deletion method, the excess chemical po- tential was calculated through a combination of insertion and deletion moves, chain breaking and rebuilding, and more. Using the particle deletion method together with the connectivity-altering end-bridging Monte Carlo move to make an equilibrated matrix, Theodorou and cowork- ers investigated the infinite dilution solubility of benzene in a matrix of polyethylene chains with degree of poly- merization N = 44.22 The phase diagram of long chains with N = 2048 monomers in semi-dilute solution was calculated with the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method for polymer chains modeled as self-avoiding walks with attractive energy between each pair of neighboring non- bonded monomers on a simple cubic lattice with helical boundary conditions.23\n",

      "A common observation from these studies is that they involve polymeric systems at low density, or in solution.23 Computational investigations involving realistic polymer structures with all-atom or United Atom (UA) resolu- tions at high density remain computationally intractable when the chain length exceeds 30 monomers.12 This ab- sence of computational research addressing the phase di- agram of high-density liquids containing long polymer chains underscores the challenges associated with mea- suring converging excess free energies for these systems using insertion methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alternative computational method to Widom inser- tion is thermodynamic integration, where the free energy is calculated by integrating the pressure along a trajec- tory of increasing density.2 Nevertheless, this approach remains computationally demanding for polymeric liq- uids, because it is sensitive to the chosen integration path, and its accuracy hinges on factors such as sampling frequency, integration point placement, and the preci- sion of the initial integration state. In the presence of a phase transition, thermodynamic integration becomes impractical due to the challenge of defining a reliable in- tegration path that captures necessary ensemble averages while transitioning between phases.2\n",
      "\n",
      "Some methods rely on determining the equation of state (EOS) from which the chemical potential can be cal- culated using standard thermodynamic relations.24 For instance, methods have been developed using a pertur- bative expansion around the hard-sphere EOS. However, such a procedure becomes challenging for complex sys- tems because it requires a significant number of ad- justable parameters to fit for accuracy.22,25 Thus, the Widom method could still be the most promising strat- egy to solve this problem.\n",

      "Another theoretical method is self-consistent field the- ory. This is a continuum approach that effectively pre- dicts phase diagrams of complex polymeric systems in the limit of high molecular weight chains (N > 00) and high-density liquids. In this context, fluctuations\n",
      "\n",
      "are suppressed, and the specific monomeric structure of the sample becomes less significant. Field-theoretical cal- culations rely on phenomenological interaction parame- ters and do not directly connect to the atomistic pic- ture. Compared with mean-field and continuum theories, particle-based methods hold an advantage by directly connecting to the local structural information while in- corporating fluctuations. 26\n",
      "\n",
      "Our proposed approach combines Widom's one-step, one-molecule insertion technique with a coarse-grained (CG) representation of polymer liquids based on the Inte- gral Equation theory of Coarse-Graining (IECG).27 The IECG method is an extension of polymer Reference In- teraction Site Model (polymer RISM or PRISM) theory, which is itself an extension of atomic Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) integral equation theory.28 Notably, the soft po- tential inherent to the IECG method addresses the chal- lenges associated with insertion, particularly for longer polymer chains where the interpolymer potential of IECG becomes softer. This results in the efficient acceptance of most chain insertions during Monte Carlo simulations, facilitating the straightforward computation of the excess chemical potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate the excess chemical potential using the IECG approach, we integrated our CG potential into an open source software package called Monte Carlo for Complex Chemical Systems (MCCCS), 5,29 created and maintained by the Siepmann group, that implements a CBMC algorithm within the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) simulation method.30 This modified code, referred to herein as \"MCCCS-CG\", allowed direct cal- culation of the chemical potential for polymer liquids at atomistic resolutions using the CBMC approach and was then extended to evaluate the excess chemical potential of CG polymer chains across various state points for a range of polymer liquids at high densities. These ther- modynamic conditions ensured the stability of the liquid phase without spontaneous phase transitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "To validate the accuracy of our proposed method, we undertook two distinct procedures. Initially, we assessed the robustness of the IECG description within MC simu- lations by comparing the structural and thermodynamic attributes of equilibrated polymer liquids with corre- sponding atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simula- tions under the same thermodynamic conditions. This step established the faithful reproduction of structural features, such as pair distribution functions, and ther- modynamic aspects like pressure, confirming the fidelity of the MCCCS-CG code in emulating the properties of atomistic MD simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a secondary test, we evaluated the MCCCS-CG simulation data for the excess chemical potential by com- paring them to theoretical predictions for the same quan- tity. The IECG method provided a theoretical expres- sion amenable to numerical solution across any thermo- dynamic state point, and an analytical solution valid, at the very least, in the high-density liquid limit. In this way, we confirmed the consistency of the IECG ap- proach in calculating the excess chemical potential for\n",

      "high-density polymer liquids. The success of these tests indicates that the proposed method could be employed to predict phase diagrams of polymer melts with long chains because it provides a reliable evaluation of the ex- cess chemical potential in the high-density regime, where insertion methods using atomistic polymer resolution do not perform well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Importantly, we examined the consistency of the chem- ical potential for various levels of CG, meaning the rep- resentation of polymer chains as different numbers of CG units, denoted as nb. We demonstrated that the ex- cess chemical potential is invariant for practical values of np. We stress though that while both the IECG the- ory and simulation provide values for the excess chemical potential, only the CG simulation is able to provide the molecular details necessary for obtaining atomistic con- figuration data through backmapping, if desired. Lastly, we emphasize the significant computational efficiency of our approach, which is orders of magnitude faster than atomistic simulations. In this study, we computed the excess chemical potential for high-density polyethylene melts encompassing degrees of polymerization ranging from N = 44 to N = 720. The agreement between the- oretical predictions and simulations consistently proved to be satisfactory across all sample cases.\n",

      "The remainder of this manuscript is structured as fol- lows. We first describe our model system and derive an exact statistical mechanical expression for the chemical potential following the Widom approach. Then, we dis- cuss the details of the intramolecular and intermolecular energies used in the expression for the chemical potential, including their connection to the IECG theory. We then summarize the IECG method of determining elements in these energies by fitting a few parameters to short-time atomistic simulation data. Following this, we derive sim- ple forms for the excess chemical potential that depend only on functions already established in the IECG the- ory. Subsequently, we discuss the ingredients of the asso- ciated CG simulation and how it extends prior simulation codes. We then present and compare the results obtained from the IECG theory and simulation. Lastly, we pro- vide a summary of the work and discuss limitations and advatages of the IECG approach.\n",

This software incorporate the gradual chain insertion technique us- ing the configuration-biased Monte Carlo (CBMC) algo- rithm. The code has been further extended and equipped with a user-friendly interface by Martin in a version called MCCCS Towhee.29 Initially, we extended the MC- CCS code to compute the excess chemical potential for polymer liquids in the united atom representations, em- ploying the CBMC methodology. Then we included the IECG model to calculate the excess chemical potential of coarse-gained polymers. We modified an old version of the MCCCS code from 2010, V2.2.\n",

IIB above. In this algorithm different conformations of polymer chains are added all at once since the potentials are soft and the number of blobs is small, and the probability of insertion of the whole IECG chain in one step is found to be high, even in high-density melts. Lastly, 3) a simple Widom expression is used to compute the excess chemical potential.\n",

The brackets (( )) denote an average over the configura- tions of the inserted chain and the preexisting ones. To calculate this value, a chain is introduced into the poly- mer matrix, and the change in internal energy resulting from the insertion is determined. Upon repeated inser- tions and equilibration of the polymer matrix itself, the average in Eq.(27) is then obtained.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the initial stage, we selected a cubic box with pe- riodic boundary conditions and prepared an equilibrated polymer matrix through Monte Carlo simulations. To attain equilibrium of the IECG multiblob liquid, the MCCCS-CG code implements three distinct types of moves in each cycle: rotation of a single-chain around its center-of-mass, linear translation of the center-of-mass, and translation of individual CG sites. When repre- senting the polymers as soft-spheres, the only move per- formed is the translation of the center-of-mass. Each move is attempted on a randomly selected chain and re- peated a number of times equal to the total number of polymers within the sample. Translational moves of each IECG site are attempted 50 % of the times, molecule translations are tried 40 % of the times, and a molecular rotations are attempted 10 % of the times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the completion of an entire equilibration cy- cle, the MCCCS-CG code initiates thousands of attempts to insert complete polymer chains. The code selects a conformation for insertion from the existing matrix's population in a random manner. As a result of this pro- cess, the distribution of conformation for the inserted chain statistically complies with the correct Boltzmann distributions for bonds and angles. The chain's confor- mational statistic adhere to an unperturbed distribution prior to insertion.\n",

As can be seen, alter- ing the degree of CG within the IECG model appears to have no effect, at least within this range of nb. Fur- thermore, note that perc increases with increasing chain length since inserting a longer chain causes a greater in- crease in the internal energy due to the greater num- ber of, predominantly repulsive at this density,32 inter- site interactions. The agreement between CG simula- tion and theory is excellent, with both the HNC and MSA theory predictions being essentially the same. Note that the MCCCS-CG code adeptly computes the excess chemical potential for a PE chain consisting of N = 720 monomers. This is in stark contrast to conventional in- sertion methods for atomistic models, which remain con- strained to either shorter chains or lower densities.\n",

      "## V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the Integral Equation theory of Coarse- Graining (IECG) was employed to compute the excess\n",
      "\n",
      "chemical potential of flexible polymer liquids, leading to the derivation of straightforward expressions. In the IECG approach, polymer liquids are modeled as collec- tions of coarse-grained (CG) chains, with each CG site representing a segment of monomers. It is essential that the size of the chain segment exceeds the polymer per- sistence length to adhere to the Gaussian statistics of monomer pair distributions and meet the theory's pre- requisites for direct correlation functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A comparison was made between the predictions of the IECG theory for polyethylene melts and data from corre- sponding simulations that utilized the derived IECG ef- fective potential. This IECG simulation code was a minor extension of the atomistic Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo software created by Siepmann and co-workers. The study examined conditions involving varying density, tempera- ture, chain length (ranging from N = 44 to 720), and the degree of coarse-graining. In all cases, the agreement be- tween theory and simulation regarding the excess chem- ical potential was found to be excellent. Equally signifi- cant, the invariance of the excess chemical potential with respect to the degree of coarse-graining, as predicted by the theory, was confirmed by the CG simulation for prac- tical values of the number of coarse-graining sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developing a procedure for conveniently computing the excess free energy and phase diagrams of dense poly- mer liquids has long been a goal in polymer physics and engineering. Particle-insertion methods effectively cap- ture the energy change resulting from the insertion of a single molecule and perform optimally at low density and for short chains, where the insertion of a polymer chain is feasible through advanced methods, such as the configuration-bias Monte Carlo method and others. In contrast, field theories focus on the universal behaviors of polymeric systems and are better suited for high-density liquids composed of very long chains, where the specific chemical nature of the polymer is not essential and fluc- tuations are minimal. There is a region of study between these two extremes, where high-density liquids of long polymer chains are of interest, which needs to be ap- proached by alternative methods. In this region, fluc- tuations are essential, and differences in the chemical structures of the monomers can result in differences in the chemical potential and phase diagrams. Traditional methods struggle to explore this region effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, it is possible to compute the excess chem- ical potential in a simulation by combining particle-based insertion methods with CG models featuring soft poten- tials. A CG representation in which the entire polymer is depicted as one soft sphere or a collection of soft spheres ensures that the attempted insertion of one polymer is readily accepted, as no sharp repulsive interactions exist during the direct insertion of the soft particle. However, having a CG model with soft interactions is necessary but not sufficient to perform reliable calculations of the excess chemical potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second necessary condition for success is that the CG model accurately predicts the polymer liquid's ther- modynamic properties. Two well-established CG models\n",
      "\n",
      "13\n",
      "\n",
      "of polymers that represent a chain as a soft sphere are the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) approach and the IECG model, the latter of which is employed here as mentioned above. Both methods offer computational convenience because the soft sphere representation signif- icantly speeds up CG simulations compared to atomistic simulations. The short-ranged shape of the DPD poten- tial further enhances computational efficiency as it does not require large simulation boxes, unlike IECG. How- ever, the DPD model has been designed to reproduce the dynamics and hydrodynamics of atomistic simulations but does not guarantee consistency in thermodynamic properties, making it unsuitable for calculating polymer phase diagrams.2\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, the computational efficiency of the IECG approach primarily arises from the accelerated dynam- ics predicted by this model, which aligns with atomistic diffusion only once it is rescaled using the contributions due to the potential of mean force and the solution of the memory function.47 The distinct advantage of the IECG model lies in its ability to accurately reproduce both the structure and pressure of the atomistic description, as demonstrated in this work. Consistent pressure is cru- cial for accurately predicting the excess chemical poten- tial since these two quantities are formally interrelated through the thermodynamics of liquids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that while the analytical solution of the excess chemical potential has been tested for long homopoly- mer melts in this study, the IECG method has broader applicability. It extends beyond the scope of this partic- ular application because it builds upon the foundation of atomistic PRISM, which was previously employed to in- vestigate various polymeric systems. The prior extension of the IECG approach to block-copolymers48 and poly- mer mixtures35,49,50 opens up the potential for calculat- ing the chemical potential and phase transition for these systems. Thus, the algorithms within the MCCCS-CG code may offer a precise means of predicting the excess chemical potential for a variety of polymeric systems with minimal computational demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it is unfeasible to directly compare the IECG model with atomistic CBMC calculations for these melts of long chains, the IECG model can be directly param- eterized using a top-down approach. This involves fine- tuning the IECG model to replicate specific experimen- tal quantities, such as the system's solubility for small molecules dispersed in a polymer matrix. Please note that evaluating the solubility, which is the transfer of a solute between two solvation environments where one is a polymer liquid and the other is a gas phase, re- quires the use of the IECG approach for mixtures we have previously developed. 35,49,50 In this top-down approach, the IECG methodology ensures that important proper- ties remain consistent across various levels of granular- ity, while significantly outperforming conventional atom- istic GEMC methods in terms of speed. These attributes are vital prerequisite for accurately calculating the excess chemical potential for long-chain polymer liquids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the potential applications of the IECG\n",
      "\n",
      "method for atomistic chemical potential calculations, there are several feasible avenues. In CBMC algorithms5 trial configurations are generated with a bias favoring low-energy configurations on a unit-by-unit basis. How- ever, in dense polymer melts of long chains, identifying low-energy configurations becomes more challenging due to the high monomer density, which can result in highly repulsive interactions are short distances when inserting a polymer. Building on the insights from this study, it is conceivable to enhance existing CBMC algorithms for rel- atively large polymer chains by integrating CBMC tech- niques for united atom models with the coarse-grained representation of long-chain polymers. This process in- volves calculating Rosenbluth weights for growing the united atom units within a given CG site after insert- ing the CG polymer chain. The objective of growing polymer chains in this way is to enhance the efficiency of CBMC moves, which are currently limited to dense poly- mer melts with about 30 monomers, or even fewer de- pending on the monomer density, using commonly avail- able computational resources. A exciting avenue for re- constructing atomistic chains from CG configurations in- volves the utilization of machine learning models.51 The implementation of such an algorithm remains a subject for future research.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we have demonstrated that the excess chemical potential remains independent of the level of coarse-graining within the IECG method. This result is contingent on the fact that the excess chemical poten- tial is primarily influenced by the intermolecular compo- nent of the internal energy, which remains independent of the chosen level of coarse-graining within the IECG ap- proach. In contrast, a linear dependence on the number of 'blobs' is expected in the ideal part of the chemical po- tential, which is influenced by intramolecular internal en- ergy. Nevertheless, the intramolecular chemical potential of a long chain in the gas phase, unlike the excess chem- ical potential in the dense melt, can be computationally determined at atomistic resolutions when needed.\n",

      "\n",
      "The polymer end-to-end distance enters the definition of the intramolecular distributions, Ômm (k), f2bm (k), and Öbb (k), which enter the equation for the IECG potential, Uoff (r), through hbb (r) and cob(r). The end-to-end distance is a static property that one can conveniently calculate from a properly equilibrated simulation. For long chains in melts, the end-to- end distance follows the scaling law of unperturbed chains. This is represented in Figure S1 where < R2 > from com- puter simulations follows < R2 >x N. Note that the quality of the potential depends on the smoothness of the intramolec- ular distributions, which requires coarse-graining of a chain fragment longer than the polymer persistence length. Note also that if the intramolecular pair distributions do not follow Gaussian statistics, one can still apply the definition of the po- tential by using as the input parameters to the model the full intramolecular distributions, which can be directly computed from atomistic simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "At fixed thermodynamic conditions, Figure S1 shows that the distance follows the statistical properties of polymers in theta conditions, scaling with the degrees of polymerization as < R2 >= a' +b' N, as expected. This implies that the end-to- end distance is a parameter that can be conveniently calculated from atomistic simulations of shorter chains and extrapolated to long chains, with minimal computational requirements.\n",

The (blue triangles) are values at large N extrapolated from short chain simulations. The end-to-end distance takes a much longer time to equilibrate than the pressure. Data are fitted using the equations c0 = a + b/N and < R2 >= a' + b' N. The values for a, b, a' and b' are -7.3041, -583.45, -145.82, and 19.945 respectively.\n",

      "ments are minimal because the pressure converges rapidly in the atomistic simulations. Thus, to fully define the parameters for the IECG model we need only a few nanoseconds-long MD trajectories (less than 3ns for the longest chains simu- lated here N = 720). An empirical equation defines the N dependence of c0, as shown in Figure S1, which scales with N as c0 = a + b/N.\n",

      "The values of < R2 > and c0 follow well-defined equa- tions, where the adjustable parameters (a, a', b, and b') are defined by fitting the equations with data from atomistic sim- ulations. Note that because the equations that define the val- ues of the two parameters are known, it is not necessary to perform atomistic simulations for each degree of polymeriza- tion of interest, but only for enough values of N to determine the parameters of the analytical equations with accuracy. This implies that the IECG model can be used to perform simula- tions for systems that cannot be directly simulated at atomistic resolution. Thus, the IECG potential is transferable and can be used to simulate systems with other degrees of polymeriza- tion.\n",

The sample with 30 PE monomers in one blob shows the limitation of the model because, even if the value of the pressure is still within the numerical error of the atomistic simulation, it starts to diverge from the average atomistic value.

Consequently, the slope of the excess chemical potential as a function of degree of polymerization becomes more pronounced at higher densities. As for the data in the Main text, the difference between the simulated excess chem- ical potential for nb = 1 and 3 is of smaller magnitude than the size of the symbols in the figure, which is the inherent error in the data.\n",

      "Figure S4 shows the excess chemical potential at increas- ing degree of polymerization but for two different densities, p = 766 and 744 kg/m3. As can be seen, an increase in density amplifies the relevance of the repulsive energetic con- tributions. Consequently, the slope of the excess chemical potential as a function of degree of polymerization becomes more pronounced at higher densities. As for the data in the Main text, the difference between the simulated excess chem- ical potential for nb = 1 and 3 is of smaller magnitude than the size of the symbols in the figure, which is the inherent error in the data.\n",

      "Figure S5 shows data that similarly illustrates how the ex- cess chemical potential increases as the simulation temper- ature is lowered. Notably, the steeper surge in per ubb occurs at the lower temperature, where the insertion of progressively longer chains results in more pronounced chain superposition, accompanied by heightened repulsive interactions.\n",

      "\n",
      "The field of polymer science has entered a transformative era, driven by remarkable innovations in polymer representation. These breakthroughs are not merely academic; they shape the DNA of industries and touch the fabric of daily life, bringing an intricate science into a form more accessible and applicable to society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Central to this revolution has been the simplification of polymer representation. Historically, the complexity of polymers—with their long, repeating chains of molecules—presented formidable challenges for researchers and industry experts alike. Each polymer's unique properties, from elasticity to thermal resistance, depend on its molecular structure. Understanding this structure is crucial for a wide range of applications, from crafting heat-resistant materials to developing sustainable plastics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent advancements in computational tools and methodologies offer a glimpse of a future where polymer representation is more intuitive and user-friendly. These technologies have the potential to redefine how polymer materials are designed, processed, and utilized across various sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "One pivotal innovation is the development of more sophisticated modeling software that accurately simulatres the physical properties of polymers under different conditions. By harnessing the power of computational physics, these programs allow researchers to visualize and predict polymer behavior, effectively accelerating the design process and reducing reliance on trial and error. Visual aids and multimedia simulations play a significant role, elucidating complex concepts in a manner that is digestible to non-specialists.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, new frameworks for polymer representation are being explored, which capture the essential features of polymer behavior without needless complexity. The introduction of polymer scales, as detailed in the work by Angel Garcia-Chung (2020), presents a nuanced understanding of polymer quantum mechanics that challenges and refines prior models. Such theoretical developments not only extend the boundaries of what we know about polymers but also lead to practical innovations in material science.\n",
      "\n",
      "The implications are far-reaching. In the medical field, for instance, clearer polymer representation has catalyzed the creation of advanced biomaterials for drug delivery and tissue engineering. In the world of consumer goods, it paves the way for improved plastics, offering the dual benefits of performance and environmental sustainability. Polymer simplicity and accessibility have the power to democratize material innovation, inviting a broader range of talent and perspectives into the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "But progress does not exist in a vacuum. Foundational studies like \"Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review\" by Xingfei Wei et al. (2020) provide a bedrock of understanding that propels these technological leaps forward. This study's deep dive into polymer heat conduction underscores the intrinsic link between academic research and practical innovation, where one feeds into the other in a perpetual cycle of advancement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The road ahead is lined with both excitement and responsibility. As polymer representation becomes increasingly user-friendly, the custodians of this knowledge—scientists, industry leaders, and policymakers—must ensure it serves the greater good. The power of these innovations to reshape industry practices and influence consumer lives brings with it the need for ethical stewardship and a commitment to sustainable progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the trailblazing journey of polymer representation is a testament to human ingenuity and its capacity to conjure simplicity from complexity. Through innovative methodologies and technologies, the once-daunting world of polymers becomes a canvas of possibility—set to leave a lasting impression on industry, research, and our day-to-day existence.\n",

      "In this article, we review thermal transport in polymers with different morphologies from aligned fibers to bulk amorphous states. We survey early and recent efforts in engineering polymers with high thermal conductivity by fabricating polymers with large-scale molecular alignments. The experimentally realized extremely high thermal conductivity of polymer nanofibers are highlighted, and understanding of thermal transport physics are discussed. We then transition to the discussion of bulk amorphous polymers with an emphasis on the physics of thermal transport and its relation with the conformation of molecular chains in polymers. We also discuss the current understanding of how the chemistry of polymers would influence thermal transport in amorphous polymers and some limited, but important chemistry-structural-property relationships. Lastly, challenges, perspectives and outlook of this field are presented. We hope this review will inspire more fundamental and applied research in the polymer thermal transport field to advance scientific understanding and engineering applications.\n",

      "Achieving high thermal conductivity in polymers is desirable for contemporary applications such as electronics packaging,1 thermal interface materials 2 and polymeric heat exchangers.3 These applications have triggered a renewed interest in exploiting thermally conductive polymers using a variety of fabrication methods, such as mechanical stretching,4, 5 electrospinning,6 nanoscale templating,7 compositing, 8, 9 and polymer blending.10 By drawing amorphous polyethylene (PE) into highly aligned fibers, chain entanglements and voids, which act as stress concentration points and phonon scattering centers in the amorphous form, are significantly reduced, leading to a thermal conductivity increase by two to three orders of magnitude.4, 11-16\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides changing the global morphology of polymers, composites are more commonly pursued in real applications since they are easier to realize and cost-effective. By compositing amorphous polymers with thermally conductive particles, thermal conductivity can be improved to as much as ~10 W/mK,17-21 and such improvement can be potentially enhanced by strong particle-matrix interfacial adhesion (e.g., covalent bond,22-24 T- Tt stacking,25 and hydrogen bond26-30) and better vibrational spectra coupling.31 Despite consistent improvements in composite thermal conductivity, the bottleneck is still the low thermal conductivity of the polymer matrices. Theoretical calculation has pointed out that a composite thermal conductivity greater than 20 W/mK is more likely to be achieved if the polymer matrix has an intrinsic thermal conductivity larger than 1 W/mK.32 However, the details of thermal transport in pure amorphous polymers are still not thoroughly understood, leaving limited guidance on designing polymers with intrinsic high thermal conductivity.\n",

      "Thermal transport in polymers is an active field, and there have been a few reviews on thermal transport in polymers and their composites in recent years.32-37 Henry's review32 is 7 years old, and there have been a large number of new studies in recent years. Chen et al's review33 focused mostly on polymer composites, and the rest of the reviews surveyed both polymers and composites. A few of these reviews are from a more engineering viewpoint (e.g., Refs.[33, 37]). The review from Xu et al.35 emphasized physical Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review. 2\n",

      "In this article, we strive to deliver a comprehensive review of the state of thermal transport in pure polymers with the emphasis of the above two aspects (i.e., thermal transport physics and chemistry- structure-property relationships). We first review recent advancements in the understanding and engineering of thermal conductivity through changing the global morphology of polymers. Specifically, we will discuss the physical origin of the high thermal conductivity in polymer chains, and how this was realized in experiments. This is followed by more discussion of studies that try to understand factors that influence the thermal conductivity of aligned polymers using mainly molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We then shift to the discussion of bulk polymers and the recent experimental and modeling studies aiming to reveal the fundamental thermal transport physics. Notable works that produce thermal conductivity higher than 1 W/mK are discussed and the mechanisms also analyzed. We also discuss the concept of using external stimulation to tune the thermal conductivity of polymers. Lastly, we discuss challenges, perspectives and outlook in this field.\n",

      "Polymers, those once believed to be thermal insulators, are now breaking the boundary between insulators and thermal conductors, thanks to a few seminal works showing that the thermal conductivity of polymer fibers can be even higher than common metals.4, 11, 38, 39 Fibrous or elongated polymers have much higher thermal conductivity when compared to their bulk counterparts. Bulk polymers unavoidably have both compositional and structural defects and disorders, which introduce significant phonon scattering along the heat conduction pathway or even change the nature of heat carriers and their transport mechanism (see Section 3). Thus, polymer fibers/nanofibers, which can be engineered at the molecular level, have come into the light and become a highly promising class of material for thermal conduction applications.\n",

      "an excellent platform for studying fundamental thermal transport theories, where early physics models have paved the way for engineering research.40-44 Fourier's law has been governing heat conduction in macroscopic materials, but when thermal conductivity becomes size-dependent, Fourier's law fails, and it is known as anomalous heat conduction.45 It is found that for 1D lattices, when the momentum is conserved, the thermal conductivity is divergent with the length,46 L, in a power law of K & LB 47 The divergent exponent has been reported to fall between = and 5 2 45,48 This anomalous heat conduction was later attributed to anomalous phonon diffusion.49 While comparing L with the phonon MFPs, we should bear in mind that MFPs have a wide distribution in a given material.50\n",
      "\n",
      "We devote this section to discuss the understanding and advancement of thermal transport in polymers with aligned crystalline morphology, mostly fibers. We start with the discussion of simulation, theoretical and experimental tools used for thermal transport measurement and understanding of polymer fibers, which are also popular tools for bulk amorphous polymers. We then discuss different synthetic methods developed for fabricating polymer fibers with high thermal conductivity. Finally, we focus on how the microscopic and molecular-level structure of the polymer fibers affects phonon transport and thermal conductivity. In polymer fiber studies, PE is the most researched material, which stands out to be one of the most promising polymers to attain high thermal conductivity, and it has been a great platform to understand interesting physics related to phonon transport and structure-property relations. There has also been much work done on polymers like polythiophene (PTs), polyimide (PI), polystyrene (PS), polyurethane (PU), and polymer composite fibers, which will also be mentioned in this section.\n",

      "## 2.1. SIMULATION METHODS\n",
      "\n",
      "Computation has led the way of understanding and exploring thermally conductive polymer fibers. There are often two steps in using a model for thermal conductivity calculation.51-53 The first step is to construct polymer fibers with designated length, structure, and conformation with software like BIOVIA Material Studio. The construction of the materials is vital since a small change in structure can lead to Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review. 4\n",
      "\n",
      "significant changes in thermal conductivity, especially for aligned polymer fibers.54-56 Usually, careful relaxation and minimization of both the atomic configuration and simulation cell size are needed to ensure reaching reasonable starting structures.56 Then, simulation methods like MD or density functional theory (DFT) are applied to model the polymer fibers and calculate thermal conductivity. DFT can be more accurate in modeling interatomic interactions since it does not need empirical potentials, but it is computationally expensive and is best suited to model perfect crystals to predict the upper limit of thermal conductivity. MD, on the other hand, can simulate much larger systems to account for factors like defects and amorphous conformation, but its accuracy depends on the fidelity of empirical potentials. MD has been a valuable tool to explore the structure-property relations of polymers. Each method is further discussed in the following sections.\n",

      "The first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculation is based on the computation of the interatomic force constants extracted from DFT. First-principles-based lattice dynamics predicted that the thermal conductivity of an individual PE chain could be as high as 1400 W/mK,57 while that of a 100 nm crystalline PE fiber can reach 310 W/mK.58 With the force constants from DFT calculations and relaxation times calculated from Fermi's Golden rule, one can calculate thermal conductivity by solving the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE):59, 60\n",

      "\n",
      "## 2.1.2. MD SIMULATIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "MD simulation is one of the most widely used and powerful tools for thermal conductivity calculation of polymer fibers. 39, 51-53, 62, 63 Using this method, Henry et al. predicted that a single extended PE chain would have infinite thermal conductivity due to lack of ergodicity,39 which largely re-fueled the study of thermally conductive polymer fibers experimentally.4 MD simulations can model much larger structures (up to millions of atoms) than DFT, which helps research reveal the structure-property relation that is more relevant to real conditions. It also allows the study of thermal transport physics related to phonon scattering of defects (e.g., segmental rotation, amorphous regions, chain ends, or voids) - important factors preventing polymer fibers from reaching the theoretical limit from DFT calculation of perfect crystals.54-56, 64 There are two different kinds of MD methods used for thermal conductivity calculations, equilibrium MD (EMD) and non-equilibrium MD (NEMD), where EMD is conducted in an equilibrium state without temperature gradients, while in NEMD, a steady-state temperature gradient is established. A typical MD simulation consists of three steps: (1) starting structure construction; (2) relaxation and optimization; and (3) production runs. A reasonable starting structure followed by careful relaxation and optimization is critical to achieving the correct molecular configuration to accurately predict the thermal conductivity, which can be a strong function of the subtle conformation of chains. 12, 54-56, 65, 66\n",

      "constant, T is temperature, Jx is the heat flux in the x-direction, t is the correlation delay time. EMD for polymers usually needs a large ensemble average to obtain converged thermal conductivity. The often-used periodic boundary condition in EMD can potentially lead to an artificial correlation between certain phonon modes, which might be especially true for crystalline polymer fibers with high thermal conductivity. However, this effect has not been fully understood nor quantified.\n",
      "\n",
      "In NEMD methods, either a temperature gradient is established via thermostats (i.e., normal NEMD), or a scheme called reverse NEMD68 is used to swap atom kinetic energy between the two thermal reservoirs to establish a heat flux. When the system reaches a steady-state, the thermal conductivity is calculated by Fourier's law, k = - ar, where Jis heat flux, and - is temperature gradient in the heat flux direction. For dx polymer thermal conductivity calculation, NEMD usually predicts reproducible data without the need for large ensemble averaging, and there is a better-understood size effect that can be handled via extrapolation.69, 70\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice for heat bath is crucial for calculating accurate thermal transport properties in MD simulations, especially for systems where long wavelength phonons dominates.71, 72 Two frequently used heat baths are Nosé-Hoover heat bath (deterministic and time-reversible) and Langevin heat bath (stochastic and time-irreversible).71 The generation and accumulation of localized edge modes in Nosé-Hoover bath require multiple layers of Nosé-Hoover bath to diminish the boundary layer's temperature differences.73, 74 In contrast, Langevin baths have stochastic excitation of all modes, which prevents the accumulation of localized edge modes and generates marginal temperature differences at the boundary. Usually, we find that amorphous polymers are more immune to the effect of thermostats since the structural disorder can quickly scatter phonons generated by the thermostats to recover the intrinsic phonon distribution. However, a recent study showed that heat carrier MFP in amorphous polymer can be tens or even more than 100 nm, and there can be size effect in NEMD simulations.75 As a result, the effect of thermostats in NEMD calculation of amorphous polymer thermal conductivity deserves a detailed study in the future.\n",

      "The accurate prediction of thermal conductivity depends on the fidelity of the interatomic potentials. Both all-atom and united atom models have been used for polymer thermal conductivity calculations.39, 63, 67,76 The major difference between these two types of force fields is whether hydrogen atoms are explicitly represented. Henry et al. argued that the explicit simulation of hydrogen atoms is necessary to capture all degrees of freedom, which is important to thermal conductivity. However, the comparison was between two different potentials (Adaptive intermolecular reactive bond order (AIREBO)77 vs. Kirkwood78). It is not yet conclusive on how important an effect the united atom model has on thermal conductivity. However, the hydrogen degrees of freedom are largely un-excited at room temperature due to quantum effects - a justification used in many studies using the united atom models. A few most commonly used all-atom potentials for thermal conductivity studies include AIREBO potential,77 the Class-II potential PCFF (polymer constant force field),79 and COMPASS force field (Condensed phase optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies). 80-82\n",

      "Since both DFT and MD can be computationally expensive, a model that can predict thermal conductivity would be valuable. A simple model has been proposed for this purpose for crystalline polymers, where only a unit cell structure is needed for the prediction:83\n",

The establishment of this model may facilitate researchers to perform preliminary thermal conductivity screening for crystalline polymers and spares them the efforts to undergo DFT or MD simulations. Besides the calculation efficiency, this model also displayed high accuracy in comparison with data from more expensive simulation methods (Fig. 1).\n",

      "Thermal bridge method: Thermal bridge method (Fig. 2a) is straightforward with relatively high precision based on Fourier's law for measuring thermal conductivity values.7, 11, 12, 85-87 It was used more than two decades ago when people directly attached the polymer fiber to a heat sink and a heater for the steady-state heat flow.87 However, precision and sample size requirements were largely limited at that time, where only micron-sized fiber or fiber bundles could be handled. The thermal bridge method has been commercialized and standardized, which allows for the measurement of much thinner fibers (down to dozens of nanometers) with improved precision. The modern thermal bridge method consists of two separate islands of heaters/sensors made of platinum/SiNx maintained at different temperatures. The polymer fiber serves as a bridge connecting these two islands and conducting heat from the high to the low- temperature islands. A combined DC and AC current is introduced to one island for Joule heating and resistance measuring, making this island the heater component. Simultaneously, on the opposite island, an AC with the same value is applied for sensing the resistance across the bridge. The thermal conductance of the fiber can then be measured.\n",

      "AFM cantilever method: AFM cantilever-assisted measurements, usually performed in high vacuum, is suitable for measuring thin fibers with nanosized diameters, and this method has a very high precision since it excludes much of the influences such as heat loss, thermal expansion, and thermal contact resistance. In a typical AFM cantilever method setup (Fig. 2b), a tipless AFM cantilever bi-material (SiNx coated with a gold film) is used for drawing and connecting one end of the polymer fiber.88 The other end of the fiber adheres to a thermocouple on a needle tip made of conductive silver epoxy. Electrical current was applied to the needle for Joule heating and temperature adjustment. A laser beam with a wavelength of 650 nm was focused onto the tip of the AFM cantilever, which is subsequently reflected onto a receiving photodiode for deflection measurement. As the temperature of the AFM cantilever changes, it bends due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of two materials (SiNx and Au), and the amount of bending, detected by the\n",

      "TDTR method: TDTR (time-domain thermoreflectance) can measure both the axial and radial thermal conductivity of the polymer fiber.16, 89 A laser is used as a power source for producing laser pulses with a constant repetitive frequency. A beam splitter will divide the laser into a pump and a probe beam whose optical paths are adjusted by a series of delay stages. Finally, both the probe and pump beams will be focused by an objective lens onto the surface of the sample (Fig. 2c). A multi-layer heat transfer model is fitted to obtain the thermal conductivity from TDTR signals. When measuring fiber samples, the fibers are first embedded into epoxy and then cut open to expose the cross-section of the fiber. A metal transducer layer is then deposited on the exposed cross-section, and TDTR is performed so that the thermal conductivity in the fiber length direction is measured. However, the application of this method is mostly limited by the laser spot size, which should be smaller than the cross-sectional area of the fiber. Thinner fibers require an objective lens with a higher magnification ratio, and most of the measuring samples are thicker than 10 um. To measure the heat conduction along the radial direction, the polymer fibers need to be indented to create a flat surface before the deposition of the transducer layer.\n",

Between them is the molecule (e.g., a single alkanedithiol molecule) subject to measurement. For sample preparation, the gold substrate was immersed in a diluted solution of target molecules for self-assembly, then the molecule would form a bridge between the SThM tip and the gold by moving the SThM tip away from the gold substrate. C-SThM represents some of the most delicate systems to measure extremely small thermal signals, which makes measuring single molecular thermal conductance possible.\n",

      "In pursuit of higher thermal conductivity, researchers had come up with many different synthesis techniques for manufacturing polymer fiber/nanofiber. Spinning is the most mentioned method for making polymer fibers in mass production, and ultra-drawing has been effective for further increasing the thermal conductivity. For spinning, there are mainly wet spinning, dry spinning, electrospinning, melt spinning, and gel spinning, which are more suitable for large-scale manufacturing at low cost.91 Table 2 compares these spinning methods. Among them, electrospinning is the most researched method because of its relatively small batch-to-batch difference and easy-to-control nature, which has been applied to polymers such as PE,92 PI,93 Nylon,6 PAN, and PMMA.94 There are also other synthesis methods for polymer fibers. For example, the nanotemplate can produce an array of polymer fibers with high thermal conductivity.95 Utilizing a nano-porous nanotemplate, it is possible to obtain chain-oriented polymer nanofibers. Figure 3a shows a comparison of thermal conductivity among different synthesis methods. Fiber drawing is both experimentally38, 88 and theoretically14, 54 proven to be effective for improving thermal conductivity, and experimental results have shown that it is possible to achieve thermal conductivity over 100 W/mK,88 which makes it comparable to that of many metals. Heat stretching after the tip-drawn step can further increase the thermal conductivity.11 In the following sub-sections, we briefly discuss the synthesis methods used to achieve high thermal conductivity polymer fibers.\n",

A typical electrospinning setup is often composed of a heated syringe pump, a high voltage region (> 10 kV) for spinning, and a grounded fiber collector (inset in Fig. 3b).92 Under this high voltage electric field, the polymer solution will form a Taylor cone and generate an elongated jet flow, becoming progressively thinner before reaching the grounded collector because of solvent evaporation and external force field. Besides its low cost, electrospinning has the advantage of being suitable for a wide range of polymers from high melting point polymers like PI93 to lower ones like PE,92 or even composite polymer fibers like PAN/graphene or PMMA/graphene composite fibers.94\n",

      "Processing conditions in electrospinning are essential for obtaining high thermal conductivity for polymer fibers.92 A higher voltage will lead to a stronger working electric field for the spinning process, increasing the elongation force and ratio and increasing the chain alignment in the fibers.6, 86 This is in line with the finding that the stretching process during spinning will reduce the fiber diameter, and fibers with smaller diameters will improve the orientation of crystallites in the polymer fibers, which in turn increases the thermal conductivity.98 However, too high a voltage will reduce the flight time for the spun polymer fibers to grow crystalline areas. Due to the existence of whipping instability in the electrospinning process, the thermal conductivity of the as-spun fibers can vary significantly even if other conditions are the same.\n",

      "Solid-state extrusion (melt spinning): A solid-state extrusion setup comprises a piston that exerts a high pressure onto the polymer, a cylindrical cavity that serves as a container for the raw materials, and a die that gives shape for to-be-extruded polymer fibers.100 This technique is a simplified version of electrospinning. Solid-state extrusion products often come with a high extrusion rate, and it improves the thermal conductivity of polymer fiber by increasing crystallinity and better chain and lamellae orientation, both of which benefit phonon transport along the chain direction.100\n",

      "Gel-spinning: Gel-spinning101 (also called dry-wet spinning) is a method very similar to solid-state extrusion, but the polymers are under a gel-state (partly liquid and partly solid). For gel-spinning, polymers go through several steps before becoming fibers. First, the polymers are dissolved in an organic solvent at elevated temperatures. This solution is then extruded and goes through a two-stage cooling and drying, where the air will remove excess solvent, and water cooling will quench the polymer into a gel state. Finally, spinneret will spin the gel state polymers into fibers. In gel-spinning, molecules will intertwine with each other, and polymer chains in the gel state will bind together and produce an enhanced inter-chain interaction along the chain direction, forming a network inside the polymer fiber and making it easier to obtain fibers with a higher draw ratio. This is the reason why gel-spinning tends to produce the highest thermal conductivity among all these other methods.\n",

A typical method for wet spinning is tip spinning, where a needle tip dips into a polymer solution at an elevated temperature, and as it pulls out, a fiber can be drawn from the solution.98 Since the drawing process is at room temperature, more defects tend to emerge in the drawn fiber. If the drawing rate is not precisely controlled, the room temperature cools down the fiber quickly, and the molecular chains will not have enough time to rearrange themselves. This method is not easily scalable for manufacturing polymer fibers in mass production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dry spinning: Dry spinning is a method developed for heat-sensitive polymer fibers.99 Typical dry spinning equipment is composed of three parts, including a polymer container with a spinneret, which extrudes polymer fibers, an evaporation cabinet for solvent evaporation, and a stretching device. In dry spinning, bulk polymers are first dissolved in volatile organic solvents to form a low viscosity fluid, which is then extruded into an evaporation cabinet where hot inert gas like nitrogen is used to evaporate the solvents in the polymer fiber. Finally, the dried fiber will be collected and further drawn to achieve a higher fiber orientation. It is a handy method for heat-sensitive polymers, polymers susceptible to thermal decomposition, such as polymers like PVC (polyvinyl chloride), cellulose acetate, and polybenzimidazole (PBI).99 However, the need for volatile solvents to some extent limits the selection of processable polymers.\n",

      "A typical nanotemplate method comprises three steps.95 First, polymers are squeezed into an empty AAO nanotemplate under heat and pressure; then transfer the template into a heated vacuum environment to allow for polymer infiltration into the nanotemplate; the final step is dissolving the template with a strong alkaline solvent.

      "PE nanofibers synthesized from melt-processed nanotemplate method showed that a smaller fiber diameter and higher molecular weight would yield higher thermal conductivity (7 W/mK). 95 It is also feasible to begin this process with monomers, and methods like electropolymerization were employed to polymerize the monomers to synthesize chain-oriented PI fibers.7 The resultant PI fiber had a thermal conductivity of 4.4 W/mK. A combination of high thermal conductivity and high-temperature thermal stability (200 ℃) makes it a possible candidate for TIM (thermal interfacial material) in electronic devices,7 but the stiffness of the film is a concern for forming conformal contacts with rough surfaces. Different from spinning, nanotemplate may be used to synthesize large arrays of polymer fibers, but using AAO template as a consumable for such fabrication makes the cost a major concern. In addition, the shape and shape distribution of the nanofibers largely depend on the quality of nanotemplate. Even a small difference in these templates will lead to a massive difference in thermal conductivity.7, 103\n",

      "Other methods: Other methods used to produce thermally conductive polymers include oCVD (oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition)104 and solvent separation.105 oCVD is a one-pot reaction method, where all the precursors are gathered as vapor phases in a vacuum chamber. Heating and pressure conditions are tuned to trigger the step polymerization reaction. The advantages of this method are that this is an all- dry species vapor phase reaction, where no solvent is presented, which allows for easier fabrication of films without the need for post-processing. Moreover, oCVD makes it possible to take control of both intramolecular and intermolecular structures when polymerization happens. Solvent separation for polymer fiber fabrication is comparatively more complex, and it only works for certain types of polymers (e.g., PA105) with limited yields. This method can be useful for small batch lab synthesis when spinning or other types of synthesis are not available.\n",

      "The significant increase in polymer fiber thermal conductivity after the drawing is intimately related to the change of the morphologies in the fiber structure. Under a strong strain field, twinning will facilitate the lamellar structure changing into a fibrillar structure.110 Compared to the lamellar structure, these microfibrillar structures are domains with bundles of highly ordered and oriented chains along the heat conduction direction, facilitating phonon transport and lowering their scattering. There are two stages\n",

      "of structural change in mechanical stretching, which are crucial in understanding the effects on thermal conductivity:101 (1) The amorphous area will form microfibrils. The crystalline lamellae area will shatter into several smaller crystalline blocks sandwiched by those amorphous areas; (2) Some intrafibrillar tie molecules will connect the crystalline blocks, which lie outside the microfibrils region in the first step. Upon larger strains, these intrafibrillar molecules will extend and align themselves. A higher strain ratio and slower strain rate can both improve the chain orientation in polymer nanofibers.109 When the polymer fiber is stretched under a much slower elongation process, there will be more time for the uncoiling of chain segments and rotation of chains to adjust themselves for better alignment. However, if the polymer fiber is not perfect in radius or chain segment distribution, excessive drawing can lead to the rupture of nanofiber inside the polymer fiber, which can also contribute to phonon scattering. Furthermore, a drawing speed too high can also be detrimental for thermal conductivity improvement, which will lead to internal stress buildup and limit the achievable elongation ratio at a given temperature.76, 112\n",

While local heating was found to increase the crystallinity,11 other reports showed that heat stretching could lower the crystallinity.84,89 It seems the different processing conditions may play a role in the change of crystallinity during heat stretching. In the case of reduced crystallinity (Fig. 5b), the enhancement in thermal conductivity was attributed to the shrinking of the amorphous region, and the more ordered structure in the remaining amorphous regions.\n",

However, recent work done by experiments89 and simulations113 started to explore the radial thermal conductivity in polymer fibers. Under mechanical strain, the phonon focusing effect is the main reason for a decrease in thermal conductivity in the radial direction, where the phonon velocity increases along the axial direction and decreases in the radial direction. Without strain, MD simulations showed a strong size effect in the radial direction for thermal conductivity, and the thermal conductivity in the radial direction might be much higher than their amorphous counterparts.113\n",

Thus, the application of high thermal conductivity polymer fibers will be limited by their phase change temperature (i.e., glass transition, Tg, or melting temperatures), at which structural change in the polymer greatly influences the thermal conductivity.

      "\n",
      "Large crystallites and better alignment will increase the intermediate-range order, and phonon MFP, which increases the thermal conductivity.6 We can often find high crystallinity and large crystallite sizes in most high thermal conductivity polymer fibers. The reason that one can never achieve the theoretical value of high thermal conductivity is that, in reality, it is impossible to synthesize purely crystalline polymers. However, it is shown that factors like orientation, crystalline-amorphous interfaces, and phase distribution need to be considered, and thus a high crystallinity does not always guarantee high thermal conductivity if the crystallites are not well aligned in the polymer.92, 123 While the crystalline domains should have much higher thermal conductivity than their amorphous counterparts,112 the existence of amorphous phases between these crystalline domains can present large thermal resistance.7, 110 In addition, the crystal- amorphous interface can also scatter phonons.112 It is not clear how large a role such interfacial thermal resistance plays in the overall thermal conductivity. It has been shown that if the amorphous region consists of linker molecules, the crystal-amorphous interface is connected by covalent bonds, which present much smaller resistance than the amorphous region itself.64 However, if the interface is connected by purely weak vdW forces, the relative importance of the interfacial resistance will depend on the size of the amorphous domain, which might still dominate the overall thermal resistance given its low thermal conductivity.\n",

      "It should be pointed out that amorphous phases in polymer fibers can have a certain degree of chain alignment or orientation preference due to its synthesis process, which is different from the fully random amorphous structure in bulk polymers. External forces like stretching can align the chains in amorphous regions and give them higher order, and large forces will straighten the chains in the amorphous region, which will facilitate thermal transport.110 Robbins et al. measured the MFP of polymer fibers with transient grating (TG) spectroscopy.126 They pointed out that domain boundary scattering instead of phonon-phonon\n",

Moreover, amorphous regions can allow the travel of low-energy phonons, which help the propagation of thermal phonons between crystalline areas.

      "The types of inter- and intra-chain bonding (vdW or covalent bonds) and their relative ratio in the fiber can influence the thermal conductivity of polymer fibers. The contribution towards thermal conductivity from covalent bonds is much higher than that from weak forces like vdW forces.76 Stronger inter-chain vdW and large dihedral angle energy will confine the chains and limit the rotation of chain segments, 52, 56 giving rise to higher thermal stability and thermal conductivity.56 However, inter-chain vdW interaction can also scatter phonons inside the chain, impeding thermal transport.127 Apparently, the above-mentioned competing effects coexist. Intra-chain vdW forces would mostly work adversely to thermal transport as it can lead chains to coil, impairing the thermal transport efficiency of the covalent backbone but itself has limited contribution to thermal conductivity.128 Such effect is better demonstrated in amorphous polymers as will be discussed in Section 3.5.3.\n",

In this sense, it was found that lighter and more symmetric side groups are less detrimental to phonon transport.125 Simulations on bottlebrush polymers showed that longer side chains led to more disorders in the polymer and reduced thermal conductivity.130 Thermal conductivity of bottlebrush polymers with aligned backbones decreases sharply with the increasing side chain length and eventually converge to a low value, which can be explained by the fact that the interchain scattering among those long side chains increases.130 It was shown with the XRD pattern that longer side chains led to an overall polymer morphology between crystalline and amorphous phase, where an amorphous-like structure appeared in those excellently aligned polymer bottlebrush fibers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Backbone: When considering the polymer chain backbones, stiffer ones usually lead to higher thermal conductivity.16 As a result, it is shown that high modulus polymer fibers generally have higher thermal conductivity. The high moduli of polymer fibers originate from the strong covalent bonds along the backbone. Such strong intra-chain bonding can lead to higher phonon group velocity. However, there are also exceptions. For example, Kevlar, which has higher modulus than PE, displayed much lower thermal conductivity than PE. It was found that in Kevlar the energy of one of the dihedral angles along the backbone is exceptionally weak, and segmental rotation happens frequently around this dihedral angle, leading to disorder scattering.56 Other MD simulations of polymers (e.g., PDMS and PE) also revealed the same mechanism. 52, 131 Another MD work predicted that Kevlar fibers, if fully stretched to eliminate the segmental rotation, the thermal conductivity could be increased from 11.01 W/mK to 147.99 W/mK.55 It was also found that large chain segmental rotation can reduce the phonon group velocity besides phonon MFP, which also contribute to thermal conductivity reduction (Fig. 8).55 Chemical structures like double bonds or T-T stacking interactions are highly useful for improving the polymer chain's stiffness and reducing segment rotation, which offered useful insight to the structure-property relation for designing thermally conductive polymer fibers.56, 59, 104 In addition, thermal conductivity can also be improved by restricting the angular bending freedom.132\n",

Note that the effect of chain confinement has a different effect on polymer fibers vs. amorphous polymers. In ultrathin amorphous polymer thin films, the thermal conductivity increases with Rg az where dz is film thickness and Rg is the radius of gyration. In other words, stronger confinement leads to lower thermal conductivity in amorphous polymers.133 TDTR measurement of PS ultrathin films showed that in the confined region, the thermal interfacial conductance is enhanced because of less entangled chains near the PS/substrate interface.134\n",

A higher degree of polymerization leads to longer polymer chains, which usually results in higher thermal conductivity.39, 59, 95, 125 For short chains, phonon transport along the strong backbone can be mostly ballistic and mainly get scattered at the chain-ends for short chains (e.g., PE with chain segments N<50).51, 135 For longer polymer chains (e.g., PE with N>200), the dominant mechanism can instead be from factors like phonon-phonon scattering and structural disorder (e.g., segmental rotation) scattering. This was experimentally illustrated by using y-ray to cut the polymer chains shorter in polymer fibers.136, 137 The reduction in the degree of polymerization in a UHMWPE fiber from 1700 to 200 halved its thermal conductivity. Besides, the presence of heavy atoms in the monomer can lead to lower thermal conductivity since they will lead to lower phonon group velocity.56 A parametric MD study indicated a negative relationship between atomic mass and thermal conductivity of a model polymer.67\n",

All these defects serve as phonon scattering centers. Like drawing, the fabrication process can largely eliminate large extrinsic defects like voids as chains become more aligned. The molecular level defects can scatter phonons significantly in the absence of extrinsic defects. For example, it was found that kinks in the backbone can twist polymer chains and reduce thermal conductivity dramatically (Fig. 9).131 MD simulations prediction showed that a perfect PE chain with no defects could have thermal conductivity as high as 1400 W/mK and that of a defect-free PE fiber could exceed 300 W/mK.57, 129 However, the highest thermal conductivity experimentally obtained is much lower (~104 W/mK) even ultra-drawing Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review. 29\n",

Carbon nano- materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes and graphene) are promising fillers,33 but they tend to be much more expensive and their dispersion is not as well controlled as conventional fillers. In addition, since the primary purpose of thermal interface materials is to fill the air gaps between two rough surfaces, the polymer composite needs to be soft so that it can conform to the surface landscape, but softer polymers usually have lower speed of sound and lower thermal conductivity than stiffer ones. 145, 146 Moreover, loading excessive amount of fillers also stiffens polymers, impairing their ability to conform to surfaces.

      "Among them, the thermal conductivity dependence on temperature has been the most important source for the understanding of microscopic heat transfer physics in polymers. The understanding of polymer thermal conductivity largely borrowed the physical picture for amorphous inorganic materials. The explanation of thermal conductivity in amorphous dielectrics started from Kittel,153 who used a variant of the solution to the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, K = cvl/3,153 where c is volumetric heat capacity, v the average phonon group velocity and / the MFP. This is essentially the same formula for describing any phonon gas thermal conductivity, but the difference lies in . By analyzing a number of amorphous glasses, l was determined to be approximately a constant of ~7 Å. The physical interpretation is that amorphous materials have random networks of atoms, and when the dominant phonons have wavelengths shorter than the characteristic length of the atomic network, boundary scattering of the unit cells would lead to a constant l roughly equal to the atomic scale characteristic length.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a constant MFP cannot explain the thermal conductivity trend at the low temperature limit (0.1-1 K). It has been observed that thermal conductivity of all amorphous polymers has similar magnitude and a characteristic trend of ~T2 below 1 K (Fig. 11a), similar to those observed in amorphous inorganics in the same temperature range (~T1.8).154 At low temperatures, heat capacity c ~ T3, while the excited phonons have the same v, and thus the temperature dependency of / would determine the overall behavior of K. When the temperature is sufficiently low, the dominant heat carriers are long wavelength phonons, much longer than the atomic characteristic lengths. In such situations, amorphous materials behave like Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review. 33\n",

The argument was that these modes thus would have long MFPs since they cannot be effectively scattered by the structure and the anharmonicity is insignificant at low temperatures. However, this would lead to no difference between the thermal conductivity behaviors of amorphous materials and crystalline lattice, whose thermal conductivity scales with T3 at low temperatures, where l is bounded by boundary scatterings (Fig. 11a).\n",

      "Klemens, in one of his early seminal works,155 introduced the idea of structure scattering due to the disorder of the amorphous structure. He argued that while disordered structures lack regularity, instantaneous displacement of atoms can still be projected into plane waves, but these plane waves interact with each other inelastically even at the harmonic limit. It is noted that in crystals, these plane waves do not interact with each other at low temperature where anharmonicity is weak. He further argued that for modes with wavelength much larger than the lattice constant, phonons behave like propagating modes in crystals, but for modes with wavelength smaller than the lattice constant, the MFP is a constant. This model led to a K ~ T relation at the low temperature limit, while K ~ c (heat capacity) at high temperatures. Ziman156 had proposed a similar model. Both models showed that for long wavelength phonon MFP, I ~ 0-2, and since c ~ T3 and vis constant, using Kittel's model (K = cvl/3) will eventually give the K ~ T' (note: this conclusion used the fact that the dominant phonon to thermal transport has @ ~ T considering a linear dispersion157). Despite the discrepancy between Klemens' theory and the experimental trend observed at extremely low temperatures (~T2 < 1 K154), his model managed to capture thermal conductivity of quartz glass in a wide temperature range of ~ 4 - 90 K.155 It is noted that the experimental data used in his work did not extend below 1 K.\n",

When a phonon impacting the atom in the two-level system has a large enough energy to help the atom overcome the energy barrier, the phonon energy is absorbed and incoherently re-emitted, which leads to an inelastic scattering of the phonon. They have derived that the phonon MFP due to such scattering follows / ~ 0-1. When considering that the dominant phonon frequency is proportional to temperature at low temperatures (i.e., ( ~ T), one can derive / ~ T1, and then the model would successfully yield K~ ~ T3T-1 = T2 (Fig. 11a). Combining Anderson's model for long wavelength modes and constant MFP for higher frequency modes, Choy152 successfully fit the whole curve for PMMA thermal conductivity from 0.1 to 300 K. The interesting plateaus universally appear for amorphous materials, including both organics and inorganics (Fig. 11a), around 5-10 K turns out to be a simple superposition effect of the long and short wavelength phonon contributions to the thermal conductivity. It is worth mentioning that from fitting experimental data of polymers, Choy152 found the constant MFP to be around 7.2 Å for PMMA, which is very similar to that of the inorganic glass as found by Kittel.153\n",

Even for the same type of polymer (e.g., PE), with different morphologies (e.g., crystalline vs. amorphous PE), the temperature trends differ.

As shown in Fig. 11b, the high temperature behavior of crystalline PE can be roughly described by TI - the same as those of silicon and quartz also shown in the figure. For amorphous polymers, however, the reason for their temperature trend has been attributed to the decrease in density due to thermal expansion above the glass transition temperature, Tg. Hattori164 proposed that above the glass transition temperature, micro-Brownian motion of polymer molecules became excited, which led to the increase in the molecular mobility, but we are not clear why such enhanced mobility decreases thermal conductivity. The increased mobility should have increased the thermal transport contributed by advection. However, recent simulations have found that such advection terms are negligibly small in thermal conductivity, and the decrease in thermal conductivity is associated with the decrease in density as temperature increases.111 In the book from van Krevelan and Nijgenhuis,165 thermal conductivity values of ten polymers from very low temperature to temperature higher than Tg was plotted, and an phenomenological model from Bicerano166 was able to fit the data trend for the whole temperature range well. More recently, an empirical model was developed for thermal conductivity of amorphous polymers based on the kinetic theory, where density, monomer molecular weight, and sound speed were the only parameters needed for predictions.167 The model agreed well with experimental data when it comes to temperature-dependence of thermal conductivity.\n",

As a first approximation, Hands et al.151 used the thermal conductivity model for liquids168 K~p3 for polymers above the glass transition temperature, where p is density. By surveying a number of polymers with different densities, it seems that such a relation can reasonably describe the thermal conductivity trend as a function of density (Fig. 12a). This model would predict a decreasing trend as a function of temperature. Such a decreasing trend is fundamentally different from that in lattice thermal conductivity due to anharmonic phonon scattering. *\n",

      "However, if we fit the data using a power law, it would yield K~p0.9 (Fig. 12a). We would like to cast our doubts on the application of the model for liquid thermal conductivity to polymers. We have recently found that thermal transport along the polymer chain backbone contributes more significantly to thermal conductivity via the strong intra-molecular covalent bonding interactions than inter-molecular interactions (Fig. 12b).111 In contrast, thermal transport in liquids is due to advection and inter-molecular energy transfer. It has been proven that the change in density (Fig. 12c) is accompanied by the change in radius of gyration (Rg) of polymer chains, which influences the thermal transport along the polymer chain backbone (Fig. 12d). When density decreases, the chains have more room to move, which can influence the Rg due to the competition of enthalpic and entropic effects, 111 and thus change the contribution from the intra-chain interaction to thermal conductivity. In the meantime, the reduced density enlarges inter-molecular distance which will lead to a decrease in thermal conductivity contributed by the inter-molecular interactions.111 These two competing effects would lead to a trend slower than p3 (e.g., p0.9 seen in Fig. 12a) which was derived for liquids. It is clear from the MD simulation results in Fig. 12c-d, thermal conductivity follows a trend that resembles that of Rg as a function of temperature. Of course, Rg also depends on the type of polymers, and thus might not be fair to simply say it would be larger for lower density polymers. However, it is our belief that the thermal conductivity dependence on density of polymers is much more complicated than that in simple liquids. In addition, the impact of density on the inter-molecular thermal transport alone would not be universal since different types of interactions (e.g., vdW and Coulombic interactions) have different decay rates as the interatomic separation enlarges (e.g., vdW ~ r6, and Coulombic ~ r'), which are found to be critically important in interpreting the trend of polymer thermal conductivity.169\n",

In the classical limit, there are 3N (N is the number of atoms) vibrational modes in a system and higher density leads to higher volumetric heat capacity.

      "We note that recently Xi et al.175 proposed a universal formula to calculate the thermal conductivity of materials ranging from crystals to amorphous polymers. For amorphous polymers, the formula leverages a network theory developed by Zhou et al.176 In their physical picture, the amorphous polymer system is treated as a percolation network of segments of polymer chains. Heat conduction depends on the density and interaction strength of the connection points in the network. It was assumed that the heat transfer efficiency is determined by the van der Waals (vdW) interaction between the segments connected to each connection point. The model could explain well the universal low thermal conductivity in amorphous polymers and its temperature and pressure dependence. However, questions remain on why the segments connected to each point have the same heat transfer efficiency that is dictated by vdW interactions, while at least two of the four segments are connected by covalent bonds. As discussed previously, molecular simulations have shown that thermal transport along the covalent backbone usually dominates even in the amorphous phase. It is possible that if such local bonding anisotropy can be implemented, the model may reach higher quantitative accuracy. Alternatively, maybe some effective connection point density should be used other than the actual physical connection point density since polymer chains in the molecular level are almost closely packed.\n",

      "Many polymers are semi-crystalline and this could have effects on the apparent MFP, l, since heat carriers traveling in the crystal domains would be subject to less structural disorder scattering and thus have longer l, which will lead to higher thermal conductivity. Hattori177 found a linear relationship between thermal conductivity of polytrifluorochloroethylene (PCTFE) and the degree of crystallinity at room temperature (Fig. 13b). He made an argument that when there were more crystalline domains in the polymer, the effective MFP of heat carriers were larger and thus the thermal conductivity increased when considering the phonon gas model (i.e., K = cvl/3). Crystallization can happen spontaneously given proper heat treatment (e.g., annealing). In such cases, the thermal conductivity would still be isotropic since the crystallites orients randomly. As discussed previously in Section 2.4, crystallites orientation can be forced via extrusion or drawing, which induces shear to the internal structure of polymers (Fig. 13a). Even with small draw ratios, experimental characterization has shown that crystallinity can be high and crystalline lamellae will start to align well in the draw direction.178, 179 Further drawing will stretch the tie molecules between the lamellae and pull out crystalline blocks. When the drawing ratio further increases, these crystalline blocks will further align along the draw direction.152\n",

      "As shown in Fig. 13c, it is interesting to find out that even with low draw ratio (~5), the crystallinity of the polymer is already 0.9, where the thermal conductivity is around 2 W/mK.38 Further increasing the draw ratio to over 100 in thin films only increase the crystallinity slightly, but the thermal conductivity increase is tremendous to ~ 60 W/mK.110 Ultra-drawing fibers into nanofibers was shown to further increase the thermal conductivity to ~100 W/mK.4 However, the room for crystallinity increase is small after certain draw ratios (~5), and it has been found that the crystallite orientation along the draw direction also saturates after relatively low draw ratio of ~10,110 after which thermal conductivity continued to increase by 10 folds (Fig. 13c, purple crosses). SAXS (Small-angle X-ray scattering) and WAXS (Wide-angle X-ray scattering) analyses indicated that increasing the draw ratio beyond ~10 will lead to the decrease in the amorphous volume fraction, which effectively increases crystallinity, but such increase is not significant. Thus, this could still not explain the high thermal conductivity increase. Using a serial thermal resistance model, the authors concluded that the thermal conductivity of the amorphous portion is increasing when the draw ratio increases, and at a draw ratio of ~110, the amorphous thermal conductivity is calculated to be around 15 W/mK.110 It was noted that the amorphous region is not crystallized but chains are somewhat orientated. Lu et al.,64 using MD simulations to study semi-crystalline PE, found the thermal conductivity of the amorphous region needed to be modified due to the bridge (tie) molecules between the two neighboring crystallites in order to properly describe the semi-crystalline PE thermal conductivity especially at high crystallinities (>83%). The thermal conductivity of semi-crystalline PE depends on the number of tie molecules bridging the crystallites. It might also be possible that after the tie molecules are stretched, their chain segments along the backbone become more ordered, which is critical to enhancing thermal transport\n",

      "Speed of sound has been another important factor that has been commonly linked to polymer thermal conductivity (i.e., K = cvl/3), besides heat capacity and MFP. Sound speed is related to the modulus of materials and thus we usually see harder materials having higher thermal conductivity. For example, diamond and cubic BN, the hardest materials, are known to have among the highest thermal conductivity in nature. 182, 183 Modulus can be measured from conventional tensile mechanical test, which can be used to calculate speed of sound. Speed of sound can also be measured directly using acoustic echoes in pump- probe measurements where thermal conductivity can be characterized in the same experiment.146 Figure 14 shows some experimental and MD thermal conductivity data for polymers as a function of the average speed of sound. Here, the average speed of sound is calculated as Vave = 1/3(V[+2V1), where V1 and Vrare respectively the speeds of the longitudinal and transverse acoustic modes (i.e., phonon group velocities at Brillouin Zone center). As can be seen, there is a generally increasing trend of thermal conductivity against the average speed of sound. Data shown in Fig. 14 are also tabulated in Table 3.\n",

      "However, there are doubts on the accuracy of using speed of sound to describe the heat carrier traveling speed. Heat carriers in disordered structures have a wide frequency spectrum and only those with very low frequencies (i.e., long wavelength) can be reasonably assigned with the speed of sound as their traveling speed. For those intermediate frequency and higher frequency modes, they should have lower traveling speed. It might be reasonable to use K = cvl/3 or its variations for very low temperature thermal conductivity when long wavelength phonons dominate. At higher temperatures, the dominant frequency shifts to a higher region, which should have lower traveling speed compared to low frequency modes. It was pointed out that only at very low temperature (<1 K), heat capacity approaches the value predicted on the basis of the sound velocity.185 Allen and Feldman186 categorized the heat carriers in amorphous materials into three kinds depending on their nature: propagons (phonon-like propagating wave delocalized over large distances), diffusons (extended vibration modes delocalized over a short distances) and locons (highly localized modes). Depending on temperature, morphology and materials, these modes can contribute differently to heat conduction. In terms of population, the diffusons and locons are the majority. According to Allen and Feldman's calculation, diffusons, rather than the long wavelength propagons, are by far the most dominant heat carriers at room temperatures.186 Diffusons transport fundamentally differently from propagons since they transfer energy via diffusion-like mechanism between extended but non-propagating modes, a picture that is different from the phonon gas model. Alexander et al. described transport of such non-propagating modes as anharmonic coupling.187 187 Lv et al. 174 showed that diffusons can also correlate to locons so that the energy of locons can be effectively transferred spatially with the help of diffusons. It is hard to rationalize that these diffusons or locons would travel with speed of sound, and their transport might be better described by a correlation picture.188 However, another recent study showed that propagons were the dominant contributors to thermal conductivity in amorphous silicon,189 and these modes are mainly\n",

      "As discussed previously, while polymers share similar low temperature thermal conductivity behavior since they all behave like an elastic medium to support long wavelength transport, their higher temperature thermal conductivity becomes diverse in temperature dependency and amplitude. The above discussion has eluded such differences to the inherent chemistry of different polymers. In our opinion, the ability to correlate chemistry of polymers and their thermal conductivity is the crown-jewel of this field since it would provide the ultimate guidance needed for materials by design. Chemistry of the polymer directly determines the atomic mass and bonding natures, which further influences the conformation of chains, density, the ability to form crystal structures, interatomic interaction, heat capacity, speed of sound, etc. As mentioned in Hands et al.'s work in 1973,151 research efforts had aimed to provide chemists and engineers with assistance to predict the thermal conductivity of a polymer given their chemical nature, such as molecular weight, degree of branching and crosslinking, stereoregularity, crystallization, defects (voids and structural irregularities), and molecular orientation, together with external parameters like temperature and pressure. It is fair to say that important physics has been understood along the way, but the ability to precisely predict thermal conductivity based on chemistry still needs much work. However, we are seeing increased efforts in recent years to achieve understanding of the correlation between the chemical composition of a polymer and their bulk thermal conductivity. In this section, we discuss works that have helped unravel the chemistry-thermal conductivity relation.\n",

      "Relating thermal conductivity to even the simplest chemistry feature, the chain length (i.e., degree of polymerization), has not been straightforward. Early experiments by Hansen et al.194 on PE found that the thermal conductivity of amorphous polymers scaled with the square root of the molecular weight for short chains and converges when the chain lengths are sufficiently long. The observed relation was k x VMw when Mw < 100,000. Since then, this trend of thermal conductivity increasing with Mw was also observed in other types of polymers, such as PMMA,195 polystyrene (PS), 196 and polycaprolactam (PCL).197 For sufficiently long chains, Fesciyan et al.198 derived a model for thermal conductivity based on the Green- Kubo formula for high molecular weight polymer melts, but the derived formula was not a function of chain length. However, for shorter chains, models show diverse trends. The first model in the literature that relates thermal conductivity to molecular weight is Weber's equation for liquids, 168 K = McCpMw3p3, where Mc is 1 4 related to the material property, cp is the specific heat at constant pressure, Mw is the molecular weight and p is the mass density. According to this equation, thermal conductivity would scale with the chain length to the 1/3 power since molecular weight is linear to the degree of polymerization for the same polymer. This power, however, deviates from the experimentally observed K & Mw for short PEs.194 There were also other models suggesting an inverse relationship against molecular weight, k « (-1-)ª, where a was 0.3 (Ref. [199]) or 0.5 (Ref. [200]). These examples show the difficulty in developing a physical understanding that can relate the thermal conductivity to the polymer chemistry in amorphous polymers.\n",

Ohara et. al.201 used MD to calculate the thermal conductivity of short PEs (n-alkane) with chain length up to 24 carbon segments, but there was no obvious trend as a function of chain length observed. In this study, they developed a method to decompose the thermal conductivity into contributions from different inter-atomic interactions (bonding and non-bonding interactions) and molecular advection. They found that as chain length increases, the contribution of intra-chain bonding interaction increases\n",

For C24H50, intra-chain bonding forces contribute ~ 50% of total thermal conductivity, compared to ~30% from non-bonding interactions and ~20% from advection. This is an important result since it implies that thermal transport along the chain can be as important as, if not more important than, non-bonding interactions - a critical difference between polymers, simple liquids (little intra-chain contribution) and inorganic amorphous materials (purely bonding interaction). Another study from Ohara's group202 found that the thermal conductivity of PAA increases with chain length due to the enhanced intra-molecular interactions. The same group203 later compared linear alcohol and linear alkane with different chain lengths, and found that thermal conductivity of alcohol was uniformly larger than alkane for the same chain lengths, but the thermal conductivity of both materials seems to converge as chain length increases. This was attributed to the contribution from the polar hydroxyl end groups in alcohol, which enhanced inter-molecular interaction. As the chain length increases, the role of end groups decreases and thus the two thermal conductivity results converge. Zhao et al.204 studied the thermal conductivity dependence on chain length in amorphous PE using MD simulations with the chain length from 4 to 1260. The calculated thermal conductivity increases initially and then reaches a plateau at higher degree of polymerization - the same trend seen in experiments. They found that there was a clear correlation between morphology and thermal conductivity, and the major differentiator is the phase of the polymer (gas, gas-liquid, and liquid) due to different chain lengths.\n",

The model was shown to agree with the MD results well. These studies focusing on a simple chemistry feature, chain length, showed that there are many factors (e.g., density and\n",

      "Some recent studies have pointed out that polymer chain conformation is a key factor influencing thermal conductivity even if the materials are in purely amorphous states. These are mainly understood by detailed MD simulations. As mentioned previously, an important feature of polymers compared to inorganic amorphous materials is their local anisotropic bonding environment consisting of both covalent bonding and non-bonding interactions like vdW and electrostatic interactions. It has been shown that in amorphous polymers, thermal transport along the chain backbone via the strong covalent bonds contributes more than those non-bonding interactions to thermal conductivity (see Fig. 12b). In recent MD simulations, Luo and coworkers have shown that the thermal conductivity of amorphous polymer is closely related to the chain conformation. 111, 128, 206 It has been observed that thermal transport along the covalent chain backbone is related to the chain conformation, especially its spatial extension as characterized by the radius of gyration (Rg).111 Through a parametric study using MD simulations, the Rg of a model PE is systematically tuned by changing its dihedral angle energy constant.111 As the dihedral angle is strengthened, there will be less segmental rotation along the chain and then the persistence length of the chains becomes larger, which in turn lead to larger Rg (Fig. 15a). While there is no direct proof, it is reasonable to think that larger Rg would allow heat transfer along the chains to reach longer spatial distantances before getting interrupted by chain ends. As seen in Fig. 15b, the PE with larger Rg has larger thermal conductivity contributed from the intra- chain bonding interactions. Such a finding indicating a positive correlation between Rg and thermal conductivity was not only observed for homopolymers,111 but was also generalized to polymer blends128 and bi-/tri-block copolymers20 (Fig. 15c).\n",

In addition to the strong backbone, the authors also argued that the strong T-T stacking facilitated inter-chain thermal transport. In a recent simulation study (not yet published), we observe that the T-T stacking does not directly enhance thermal transport across chains, but instead, it helps straighten chains and lead to enhanced intra-chain thermal transport along the covalent backbone.\n",

The SAXS and gazing incident X-ray scattering (GIXS) characterizations show that polymers with long side chains tend to have higher crystallinity and larger crystal sizes, but the reason is not currently clear.208 When such factors are considered, we were able to explain the thermal conductivity difference between the DD and the rest types of polymers using the effective medium approximation143, 209 (squares, Fig. 16b). However, it was not until we also considered the inter-molecular distance separated by the side chains (d-spacing, Fig. 16b) in the amorphous phase that we were able to reproduce the thermal conductivity trend over the whole range (triangles, Fig. 16b). This implies that not only can global morphology influence thermal transport but, in amorphous polymers, the local molecular morphologies are also important. Much fundamental research is still needed to completely understand the chain conformation effect on thermal conductivity. This will be a great challenge in this field and will be highly rewarding since it may be the critical stepstone to achieving designing thermally conductive polymers with rational chemistry selection. Tackling such a challenge, in our opinion, will require a strong collaboration between experiments, characterization, molecular simulations and potentially machine learning techniques.\n",

      "According to effective medium theory, in a binary mixture of two polymers the thermal conductivity would vary monotonically as the fraction of one component changes. For example, Morikawa et al.210 showed that the thermal diffusivity of poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) and polystyrene (PS) binary blends increase almost linearly from 1.13 to 1.63 x 10-7 m2/s, when the PPO ratio increases from 0 to 100 wt%. Another study from the same group211 also showed that polymer blends of poly(ethylene-co-cyclohexane 1,4-dimethanol terephthalate) (PETG) and bisphenol-A polycarbonate (PC) had a monotonic trend when the PC content increases, although the trend was not linear. A recent report212 showed that the thermal conductivity of a blend made of PC and ethylene-propylene copolymer (EPC) with 10 wt% PC was ~ 0.206 W/mK, between that of PC (0.240 W/mK) and PE (0.166 W/mK).

      "There are also indications that the thermal conductivity in polymer blends cannot be simply described by the effective medium theory. In 2014, Guo et al.214 observed that the binary mixture of a fullerene derivative and a conjugated polymer had a minimum thermal conductivity of ~0.06 W/mK at 30-35 vol% of the conjugated polymer, which was even lower than that of the pure fullerene derivative (~0.07 W/mK).\n",

This high thermal conductivity was unprecedented and was about an order of magnitude higher than that of common amorphous polymers. The mechanism was explained as that the interchain hydrogen bonds between PAP and PAA molecules created a homogeneous network that enhanced thermal transport.

Even if a homogeneous hydrogen bond network could form, the extremely high thermal conductivity of ~1.5 W/mK would be surprising, since in a similar vein, cross-linking, which forms homogeneous covalent bond networks led to even lower thermal conductivity for PAA (from 0.37 to 0.28 W/mK).146\n",

They also reported that polyacrylamide (PAM)-PAA blends had a maximum thermal conductivity of~0.42 W/mK at the 40% monomer molar fraction of PAM, which was attributed to that the PAM created more bridges for the major polymer PAA through interchain hydrogen bonds. However, this argument can also be countered by the lack of thermal conductivity improvement in cross-linked PAA.146 Bruns et al. also believed that the thermal conductivity improvement by blending PAM and PAA was related to the increase in stiffness (bulk modulus) due to the hydrogen bond network. However, another experimental study216 showed that due to the interchain hydrogen bond network formation by adding water, the thermal conductivity of PVA and its blends could be enhanced from 0.3-0.4 W/mK to ~0.7 W/mK, despite the significant decrease in modulus after these polymers were moisturized. Wei et al.128 studied the effects of interchain and intrachain interactions between the blending polymers by artificially tuning the interchain and intrachain interaction strengths in a model MD simulation. It was found that increasing the interchain interaction could enhance thermal conductivity, but it was due to the polymer chains in the major phase being stretched (i.e., Rg increased) and the heat flux through bonding interaction being enhanced.\n",

      "The above text focused on charge neutral polymers. The charges and highly polarized groups in polyelectrolytes, which result in strong Coulombic interactions, add another level of complexity to the thermal transport mechanism. In polyelectrolytes, due to the strong Coulombic interactions, the electrostatic forces can directly enhance thermal transport via stronger inter-molecular interactions or it may enhance thermal transport by changing the chain conformation. Shanker et. al.217 showed that at high pH the ionized PAA can reach a thermal conductivity value up to ~1.2 W/mK, and they suggested that such an enhancement is related to the electrostatic interaction between the polarized groups on the same polymer chain backbone helping stretch the polymer backbones, which in turn increase the thermal transport along the chain - similar to the effect of enhanced Rg. However, Xie et. al.145 found that the highest thermal conductivity of various polyelectrolytes, including PAA, was not more than ~0.67 W/mK. According to the counterion condensation theory, bulk amorphous polyelectrolytes tend to have a collapsed chain conformation, i.e., Rg would decrease.218-220 This thus contradicts with the mechanism proposed by Shanker et. al.217 In recent MD simulations, 169, 184 it was found that thermal conductivity would indeed increase as the ionization increases (from ~0.30 to ~0.67 W/mK, Fig. 17a), with the level of increase close to that found in experiments. 145, 217 However, the simulations failed to find obvious increase in Rg as a function of ionization, but instead found that the thermal conductivity increase could be largely attributed to the counterion-polymer electrostatic interaction. Even if with an artificial increase in the Rg of fully ionized PAA from ~12.3 to ~16.1 Å through increasing the dihedral angle strength, the thermal conductivity only slightly increased from ~0.67 to ~0.70 W/mK.169\n",

The molecular-level understanding is that the enhanced Coulombic interaction between the ionized polymer functional groups and counterions attracts them closer together, and the LJ interaction transitions from attractive to repulsive (Fig. 17e), which is evident from Fig. 17b showing the LJ potential changes from positive to negative when ionization level increases. Since the repulsive portion of the LJ potential is much steeper than the attractive portion (i.e., larger force amplitude) (Fig. 17e), being in the repulsive region would greatly enhance thermal conductivity which can be expressed as the product of the interatomic force and the atomic velocity in the molecular level.\n",

      "In polyelectrolytes with different types of counterions, the ionic charges and radii are different, which directly impact the counterion-counterion, counterion-polymer and polymer-polymer interactions. These will further influence thermal conductivity. Both experimental study145 and MD simulation184 show that thermal conductivity of common polyelectrolytes are all < 0.7 W/mK. Based on the MD simulation results, using a machine learning tool, Random Forest, the feature importance of different descriptors (atomic mass, atomic radii, vdW radii and ionic radii) associated with the counterions was quantified.184 The ionic radius emerged to have the strongest relationship with thermal conductivity, although PAA itself was an outlier (Fig. 18a). This finding might be interpreted as that when the ionic radius increases, the pairwise force decreases, and as a result, the thermal conductivity decreases. With physical reasoning, a combined parameter, n2 FLJdRDF/Vm, which was derived from the molecular-level heat flux, was proposed. This combined parameter involves the equilibrium LJ force (FLJ), atomic mass (m), number density (n) and RDF peak location ( dRDF ), and can describe a positive relationship between counterions and thermal conductivity (Fig. 18b). Such a combined parameter shed the light on the complexity of how ions could impact thermal conductivity. Thermal transport mechanism in polyelectrolytes is still not fully understood, and the possibility of making polyelectrolytes thermal conductivity > 1 W/(m.K) remains to be verified. The important aspects that can affect the thermal conductivity of polyelectrolytes are polymer chain\n",

      "Using MD simulations, Zhang et al.66 has shown that thermal conductivity of a PE crystal fiber can be regulated reversibly through temperature, mechanical strain or their combinations. In crystalline PE fibers, thermal transport is dominated by propagating phonons, and their MFP and thus thermal conductivity is very sensitive to the segmental disorder along the chains. The energy constant of the dihedral angle, which controls the segmental rotation, is on the order of ~0.1 kcal/mol - ~ 0.8kBT for room temperature. This means that thermal energy in the intermediate temperature range would be sufficient to overcome the dihedral angle energy barrier to enable segmental rotation (Fig. 19a). The ground state of the dihedral angle of PE is at 180º (trans conformation), but there are metastable states at angles of 60° and 300° (gauche conformation), and the emergence of the gauche conformation can happen within an extremely narrow temperature window of 2 K (Fig. 19b). By controlling the temperature only, the population of such disorder was able to be controlled and the thermal conductivity could be switched back and forth reversibly with a ratio of ~7 between 300 and 450 K. With the help of strains, which help eliminating the gauche population, the switching ratio could be as large as ~10 between 300 and 450 K and ~6 between 380 and 400 K. Recent experiments by Shrestha et al.12 based on ultra-drawn PE fibers11 successfully realized the MD simulation results, showing record-high solid-state thermal switch with a switching ratio of 10. Such a switchable thermal conductivity of PE was further developed in MD simulations to realize thermal diode with very high rectification factors,65 and experimental validation was recently acheived.223\n",

Using transient grating spectroscopy, Li et al. observed abrupt thermal conductivity change across the lower-critical solution temperature of thermoresponsive polymer PNIPAM aqueous solution.225 In a different study, Feng et al.228 also leveraged the hydrophobicity change across the low critical solution temperature of the PNIPAM hydrogel to tune the internal morphology and water content for thermal regulation. They demonstrated a thermal switching factor up to 3.6. Using a polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogel, Tang et al. showed that the thermal conductivity can vary from 0.33 to 0.51 W/mK due to hydration-induced cross-linking and water content change, while the thermal conductivity was not sensitive to temperature in the range of 25-40 ℃.229\n",

This change was related to the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules with respect to the heat transfer direction. When the magnetic field was parallel to the substrate, the thermal conductivity was 0.14 W/mK, and it increased to 0.24 W/mK when the field was rotated by 90°. Recently, another study from the same group231 demonstrated thermal regulation using light excitation. It was shown that a light-responsive polymer could switch its thermal conductivity from 0.35 W/mK under normal condition to 0.10 W/mK upon UV-light excitation, reaching a modulation factor as high as 3.5.

      "Besides external excitations, some special molecules process intrinsic thermal regulation properties. For example, tapered bottlebrush polymers have asymmetric polymer architecture. They consist of a linear polymer backbone with side chains of systematically varied molecular weights that can be tailored to produce a cone-shaped macromolecule. Using NEMD simulations, Ma and Tian demonstrated that these polymers have the unique ability to generate significant thermal rectification that cannot be rationalized based on conventional wisdom.232 In sharp contrast to all other reported asymmetric nanostructures, they observed that the heat current from the wide end to the narrow end (the forward direction) in tapered bottlebrush polymers is smaller than that in the opposite direction (the backward direction). Further analysis showed that a more disordered to less disordered structural transition within tapered bottlebrush polymers is essential for generating nonlinearity in heat conduction for thermal rectification. Moreover, the thermal rectification ratio increased with device length, reaching as high as ~70% with a device length of 28.5 nm as shown in Fig. 20. This large thermal rectification with strong length dependence uncovered an unprecedented phenomenon-diffusive thermal transport in the forward direction and ballistic thermal transport in the backward direction. This is the first observation of a switching between different heat transfer regions as the heat flow direction flips. The fundamentally new knowledge gained from this study may spark interest into intrinsic thermal rectification in asymmetric polymer molecules. Future work to scale up the single molecule rectification would be needed to drive practical applications.\n",

      "Research on interfacial thermal transport across hard-soft material interfaces has generally focused on binding energy - a critical factors that influence interfacial thermal transport.22, 27, 235-238 Properly functionalizing solid surfaces can enhance thermal conductance between metal and organics by up to three times due to the improved hydrophilicity.26, 235 Forming covalent bonds at the interface can enable even larger enhancement in thermal conductance.9, 23, 24, 239, 240 Hydrogen bonds, which are far less energetic than covalent bonds, however, were found to enhance thermal conductance across hard-soft interface by similar amplitude as covalent bonds.28,241 In such interfaces, the interactions consist of vdW interactions and strong Coulombic interactions between highly polar groups (e.g., hydrogen bond donors and acceptors). It would be intuitive to believe that it is the strong Coulombic interaction that led to the enhanced thermal conductance compared to non-polar interfaces. However, detailed thermal conductance decomposition into contributions from different interactions and structure characterization near the interface suggest that the enhanced conductance was a collaborative effect from vdW and Coulombic interactions. It was found that Coulombic forces attract the organic molecules closer to the interface, which in turn increased the force from vdW interactions. Interestingly, it turned out that vdW was the direct contributor to the thermal conductance enhancement while Coulombic was helping in an indirect manner.28, 242 Such a molecular thermal transport picture is similar to that found in bulk polyelectrolytes as discussed in Section 3.5.4.\n",

The thermal conductance of such interfaces is thus usually at the low end (~O(10) W/mK). 27, 235, 243, 244 Recently, experimental measurements demonstrated a significant enhancement, by as much as 7x, in thermal transport across soft-hard interfaces (Au-PE) by coating the hard surfaces with self- assembled monolayers (SAM) (Fig. 21a).31 Similar observations were made in another study.245 The\n",

While the vibrational spectra of SAM and PE are almost identical (Fig. 21b), why does the Au-SAM interface have a thermal conductance much larger than that of the Au-PE interface? Conventional mismatch models237 would have predicted similar thermal conductance for these two interfaces. One possible picture is that anharmonic channels via inelastic scattering helped distribute phonon energy from the Au to the SAM vibrational spectrum, and such energy transfer efficiency is related to the strong covalent bonds between Au and SAM. The energy transferred to the SAM spectrum from Au could then be transferred to the PE side via strong harmonic coupling due to almost perfect spectra overlap. This picture remains to be verified, and we expect non- equilibrium MD simulations coupled with spectral analysis246, 247 to be a viable tool to tackle this problem.

Further analyses indicated that the change in surface morphology did not really change the vibrational spectra of the local atoms much (inset in Fig. 22b). It is possible that the nature of the heat carriers will change from propagating phonons to modes like diffusons when the Si surface is changed into amorphous structures, and such a heat carrier nature is more similar to that in the amorphous PDMS, which somehow lead to better energy exchange across the interfaces. However, this hypothesis has not yet been tested and further study is needed. We note another recent MD simulation also showed that nanoparticle morphology could influence its thermal transport to surrounding liquid, and they attributed the impact to the coordination number of surface atoms of the nanoparticle.249\n",

The anharmonic effects across hard-soft interfaces have also been implied from many MD simulations.246, 250, 251 The results shown in Fig. 22b also implies that anharmonicity is playing a role in the observed enhancement, which becomes larger at higher temperatures. However, these studies are largely phenomenological. Models252, 253 have been proposed to include anharmonic channels (inelastic scattering) for predicting interfacial thermal conductance, but they are significantly simplified. For example, the only inelastic channels considered were the processes that n phonons with the same frequency @ scatter simultaneously to generate a phonon with frequency no. In recent years, MD simulations on solid-solid interfaces have pointed to the fact that scattering of heat carriers prior to reaching the interface can help re- distribute phonon energy to a state that is preferred for harmonic coupling across the interface.254-256 Such pre-interface scattering is not limited to anharmonic scattering254 but also defect scattering.255 Could the SAM layer and the amorphous surface in the above-discussed examples have played similar roles in enhancing thermal transport across hard-soft interfaces? Further studies are needed to answer this question. MD simulation remains to be the ideal tool to answer such a question since it inherently includes anharmonicity, structure disorder and defects.

      "A detailed study of heat carrier modes and their transport properties are still to be done to better understand the thermal transport physics in polymers. While Allen and Feldman186, 262 have proposed a physical picture of heat carriers in disordered materials, and recent simulation and experimental studies have furthered the understanding, 189, 263-267 their theory has rarely been applied to polymers. The only application of the Allen-Feldman picture to polymers we are aware of is from Shenogin et al.192 on amorphous PS. It showed that hardly any modes were propagons and modes above 5 THz were all locons, although the whole vibrational spectra could extend to ~90 THz. The large population of localized modes were attributed to the rigidity of PS chains, which would result in relatively high frequency vibrations. The thermal conductivity obtained from the Allen-Feldman theory were significantly lower than MD simulation results at temperatures above 100 K, and even the trends did not agree with one another.192 Anharmonicity was considered as the possible factor for such a discrepancy, but the authors also noted that it was puzzling to find the MD yielded lower thermal conductivity than the Allen-Feldman theory, which is purely harmonic. Indeed, Alexander et al.187 described the transport of non-propogating modes via an anharmonic coupling picture, and Lv et al.174 used MD simulation to show that locons could contribute to thermal transport through anharmonic coupling with diffusons. While these were for inorganic materials, a similar physical picture could apply to polymers, which of course, needs verification. The ideal tool would be normal mode analysis188 in MD simulations which inherently include anharmonic effect and captures realistic polymer structures and interactions. However, challenges exist in such studies for polymer, since in modal analysis, atomic vibration needs to be projected on to the eigenvectors of the normal modes that are determined from diagonalizing the dynamical matrix constructed from interatomic force constants at the ground state of the system. The ability of using modal decomposition for inorganic material lies in the fact that all atoms are vibrating around their equilibrium throughout the course of simulation, and thus the\n",

      "eigenvectors, determined from their ground state coordinates, do not change over time. For polymers, however, this could become very tricky since it is very difficult to relax the atoms to their global ground state since the movements of atoms are highly restricted by the bonding and non-bonding interactions as well as stereo-hinderance. As a result, when doing lattice dynamics, it is very likely that atoms are in metastable positions and some eigen-frequencies are negative. This would impose questions on the validity of the eigenvector to which the atomic coordinates need to be projected onto. In addition, during the simulation where atomic trajectory is tracked, the atoms can drift significantly, moving away from the initial equilibrium position. Normal mode analysis is inherently based on perturbation theory, and such large movement away from the equilibrium may invalidate this assumption meant to deal with small perturbations. Actually, according to the two-level system picture from Anderson et al.162 and Phillips163, it is indeed very likely that atoms would hop between metastable states back and forth (see inset schematic in Fig. 11a).\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, a key difference between polymer and inorganic amorphous materials is the locally anisotropic bonding. How would the modes transfer energy within the polymer chain through the strong bonding and across chains via weaker non-bonding interactions would be a unique question for polymer thermal transport. It would be intuitive to think that the diffusons transfer energy more efficiently along the covalent backbone and less so across chains, but why cross-linking, which forms covalent bonds between chains, turned out to reduce thermal conductivity (e.g., PAA - 0.37 W/mK to cross-linked PAA - 0.28 W/mK146)? Is it possible that the passing of the diffusons is accompanied by the anharmonic energy communication with locons along the way? If propagons are not important in thermal transport in polymers as found by Shenogin et al.192, would the use of K = cvl/3,153 or its different variants be questionable? How much can we truly borrow from the understanding of thermal transport in disordered inorganics267 to explore polymer thermal transport? We believe these are only a fraction of the fundamental questions that are worth answering, but tools do not yet exist to fully explore them.\n",

      "Besides the motivation to pursue the fundamental science, an overarching goal of studying thermal transport physics in polymer is to provide engineers with a reliable tool to predict the thermal conductivity of a polymer given its chemical nature, or to give chemists and material scientists the guidance to design a polymer based on the needed thermal conductivity to realize the so-called material-by-design. We are currently far from attaining these capabilities, although some pieces of advice can be extracted from past studies. There are so many factors, including polymer chemistry, morphology, processing conditions and etc., that can impact thermal conductivity. Obviously, establishing a model that links all these parameters to thermal conductivity is impractical given that the physics is not fully elucidated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Materials Informatics using machine learning (ML) techniques is an important component towards the eventual realization of material-by-design.268 ML has been recently applied to thermal conductivity,269 especially for designing inorganic semiconductors with low thermal conductivity, mainly motivated by the demand of high performance thermoelectrics.270-273 However, Materials Informatics concerning polymers (i.e., Polymer Informatics) has been hindered by the lack of data in a unified format.274 For example, the largest open polymer database, PolyInfo, only has < 80 thermal conductivity data, let alone that these data contain uncertainties. Unlike inorganic crystals which have well-defined lattice structures, it is also challenging to produce large datasets for amorphous polymers using high-throughput simulations due to the uncertainty and difficulty in generating reasonable amorphous structures. Polymer has not yet been a focus of national and international initiatives like the Materials Genome program, making the data growth slow in the foreseeable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent study, ML techniques was used to construct a surrogate model between polymer chemistry represented by SMILES (Simplified molecular-input line-entry system) strings and thermal conductivity.275 Interestingly, they were able to obtain a deep neural network (DNN) model with reasonable accuracy (R2=0.73) using merely 28 training data points in thermal conductivity available from the PolyInfo database. This was realized by implementing a novel technique called Transfer Learning, which \"transfers\" Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review. 70\n",

      "knowledge learned from training against highly populated proxy labels (in their case, ~6000 data points on glass transition temperature, Tg) into constructing DNN for sparsely populated labels (i.e., thermal conductivity). By directly training a DNN against the 28 thermal conductivity data, R2 was -0.4 (i.e., no prediction power), but Transfer Learning helped improve the model accuracy to R2=0.73. The essence of Transfer Learning is that different properties are different expressions of the inherent chemistry of materials. However, the transferred DNN is still much inferior compared to the model for the highly populated label, Tg (R2=0.92). It is our belief that Transfer Learning can further improve the model accuracy if more thermal conductivity labels can be leveraged in the training, and this has been shown in a recent work on inorganic crystals.276 Some authors of the present review article are currently dedicating efforts to generate a large thermal conductivity database through high-throughput MD simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Tg might not be the only proxy label that can be used for Transfer Learning. Other intermediate labels, such as Rg, modulus, effective charges, and even force field parameters,277 which can be calculated more quickly than thermal conductivity, may also provide a bridge to construct more accurate thermal conductivity surrogate models via Transfer Learning. Besides ML models, recent findings showed that properly representing polymer molecules can be important for constructing accurate surrogate models, since representations describe the chemistry of molecules.278 It was found that a deep learning representation scheme (i.e., Mol2Vec) based on the Natural Language Process (NLP) algorithm was better than the conventionally used Morgan Fingerprint, a one-hot encoding scheme based on the simple chemical connections. Even if a chemistry-thermal conductivity relation can be identified from ML, properly including processing conditions as descriptors could be another obstacle for eventually validating the model prediction, as processing conditions can impact the morphology which in turn influence thermal conductivity. Processing conditions are not something that can be easily modeled, either.\n",

      "The intent to use polymers for heat transfer application is not because they can conduct heat better than metals or semiconductors, but instead, is motivated by their other superior properties compared to these better thermal conductors. For example, plastic heat exchangers are more chemically resistive, lighter- weight and cheaper than metallic ones. Polymers are softer than metals so they are used as thermal interface materials to filled the gaps between rough surfaces in electronic packages.2 Polymers are ideal for solid- state electrolytes, improving their thermal conductivity helps heat dissipation and thus safety.279 Because of the application requirements, designing polymers with desired thermal conductivity is always constrained by their other properties. For example, loading metallic fillers into polymer matrices for thermal conductivity improvement limits their application in electronics due to short circuiting concerns. Adding excessive fillers also hardens polymers, impairing their ability to fill gaps. Materials informatics with multi- objective optimization can be a valuable tool to balance different design targets for different applications.280\n",

      "\"Any consideration of thermal conductivity, particularly in the context of amorphous polymers, is restricted by three principal factors. The first is the present lack of understanding of the nature of molecular organization in the amorphous, or so-called amorphous, state, whether a material is in the overt liquid or supercooled glassy phase. The second is the absence of any precise working theory for such a material, and the third is the paucity of data, coupled with some uncertainty in the reliability of even this. The latter represents the experimental difficulties associated with the measurement of thermal conductivity, although figures are usually available to two significant figures on most commercially available polymers.\" This is quoted from Hands' 1973 paper.151 The first two restricting factors certainly remains true up to date, although accurately measuring polymer thermal conductivity can now be achieved using various techniques. The first factor is related to the chemistry-property relationships, while the second one calls for better models to describe the heat carrier transport physics. With this review, we hope to summarize the advancements in thermal transport physics in polymers and point out places where more research is needed. The underlying physics of thermal transport in crystalline fibers resemble a lot to that in inorganic lattices, but thermal transport in amorphous polymers is certainly a different scenario despite its similarity to amorphous inorganics. It is our belief that we are still far from completely understanding the complicated chemistry-property relationship for amorphous polymers. We hope there will be a collective effort from different communities to leverage different tools, including simulation, experiments and machine learning, to work towards better understanding polymer thermal transport.\n",

      "The text outlines that the paper provides new frameworks for polymer representation in Quantum Mechanics, specifically focusing on the symplectic group's representation in Polymer Quantum Mechanics. It mentions that these developments could lead to practical innovations. The text also attributes the paper to Angel Garcia-Chung and suggests that it presents a nuanced understanding that challenges and refines prior models. \n",
      "\n",
      "The provided paper content confirms several points made in the text. It is indeed authored by Angel Garcia-Chung and deals with the representation of the symplectic group in Polymer Quantum Mechanics. The paper describes the construction of a representation of the symplectic group Sp(2n, R) without initially considering a polymer scale but then introduces it to align with previous results. However, the content does not mention any specific practical innovations in material science resulting from this research. It focuses on the theoretical aspects, such as the non-unitary evolution implied by the propagator for the polymer harmonic oscillator and the potential for the construction of generalized squeezed states, rather than direct applications in material science.\n",

      "Summary of The symplectic group in Polymer Quantum Mechanics [http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00388v1]:\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper by Angel Garcia-Chung seeks to provide a representation of the symplectic group, Sp(2n, R), in Polymer Quantum Mechanics (PQM). PQM is a quantization scheme similar to the techniques used in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), and it is characterized by its evasion of the Stone-von Neumann theorem, resulting in a non-unitary equivalence to the standard quantum mechanical formulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper begins by constructing the representation of the symplectic group within the full polymer Hilbert space without considering a polymer scale, which is analogous to the Planck length in LQC. The subsequent results include deriving the propagators for the free particle and the harmonic oscillator. A key aspect discussed is the non-unitary evolution introduced by the propagator for the polymer harmonic oscillator when the polymer scale is included.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work delves into the implications of polymer scale introduction on the symmetry transformations in polymer systems and outlines the importance of exploring the symplectic group in developing a deeper understanding of time-evolution and linear symmetries within PQM. Additionally, the possible connections between the symplectic group and squeeze states are discussed, indicating that a representation within PQM could have implications for research in generalized squeezed states, which may have links to cosmological scenarios and LQC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper is structured to first review the symplectic group's unitary representation in standard quantum mechanics and then proceed to describe how it can be expanded upon in the context of polymer quantum mechanics, building to the results for the free particle and harmonic oscillator propagators and concluding with a discussion of these findings.\n",

      "There has been rapidly growing demand of polymeric materials coming from differ- ent aspects of modern life because of the highly diverse physical and chemical proper- ties of polymers. Polymer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to exploit existing polymer data for efficient design of functional polymers. Despite many potential benefits of employing a data-driven approach to polymer de- sign, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics\n",

      "attributed to the complex hierarchical structures of polymers, such as the lack of open databases and unified structural representation. In this study, we review and discuss the applications of machine learning on different aspects of the polymer design process through four perspectives: polymer databases, representation (descriptor) of polymers, predictive models for polymer properties, and polymer design strategy. We hope that this paper can serve as an entry point for researchers interested in the field of polymer informatics.\n",

      "Polymers are one of the most important classes of material in modern society, as its applica- tions range from the plastic bags and bottles used in daily life to a variety of electronics, and even structural components in the aerospace industry. A polymer is a material made of a col- lection of chains that are built by connecting many repeated units, called monomers. These chains can form diverse structures that contribute to the highly diverse physical and chemi- cal properties of different types of polymers. Some polymers can be consisting of more than one type of monomer to form even more complicated topological structures across different length scales. The research field of polymer science and engineering emerged to understand, control, and design novel polymers that can be used to satisfy the rapidly growing demand on highly functional materials coming from different aspects of modern life. While polymers can be categorized into natural or synthetic polymers, we will focus our discussion on the latter in this paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the mainstream of materials science, polymer science has gone through mul- tiple major paradigm shifts. The early studies of polymers flourished in the first half of the 20th century was closely associated with H. Staudinger who received the Nobel Prize in 1953.1 Initially, discovery of polymers was mainly based on an empirical approach, i.e., relying on many trial-and-error experiments. Accumulation of experimental experiences has led to developments of theoretical and simple statistical models for guiding the design of new\n",

      "polymers. These include many important work by the 1974 Nobel prize recipient P. J. Flory, the group contribution method and so on.2-4 Following the rapid advances of computing power in the last few decades, computational methods has become one of the main tools to study properties of polymers.5 Recent developments of simulation techniques for vari- ous types of polymers opened up opportunities to computationally study polymers across different length scales. 6,7 While generating experimental data of polymers is often costly and time-consuming, modern supercomputers provide new opportunities for building larger databases of polymers computationally. With the drastic expansion of data size in science, a data-driven approach for scientific discovery is said to be the 4th paradigm of science. Poly- mer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to mine the precious polymer data for new knowledge. Yet, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics attributed to the complex hierarchical structures of polymers. 8,9\n",

      "Design of a polymer can be broken down into three parts corresponding to the three steps in the typical production process of polymers: design of monomers (polymerization), microstructures (crystallization), and material processing (manufacturing) (see Figure 1). Monomers, the building blocks of polymers, contribute to the foundation of potential prop- erties of the eventually produced polymers. While molecular size is one of the important factors that influences the properties of an organic material, the \"size effect\" of polymers is not directly correlated with the size of the monomers because a large collection of small monomers (e.g., ethylene) can also build long polymer chains the same way large monomers do. Instead, various metrics based on the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of a poly- mer are often used as a reference to relate the \"size of polymer\" to polymer properties. Different polymers built from the same monomer can have different MWD by controlling the polymerization process, which can lead to significantly different physical and chemical properties. 10-12 Furthermore, the collection of polymer chains can form very different crystal structures through a variety of crystallization processes, affecting the material properties of\n",

      "the resulting polymers. For example, Yi et al. controlled the crystallinity and orientation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) molecules to optimize the performance of solar cells. 13 Finally, the same type of polymer in the microscopic scale can undergo different manufacturing pro- cess, such as stretching or mixing additives, to further enhance or alter its properties in order to fulfil specific needs from a broad range of applications. 14 Ideally, the design space of polymers covers all parameters involved in the three production steps, for example, the molecule space of a single or multiple monomer(s) (namely homopolymers or copolymers, respectively), temperature and types of polymerization process, additives or fillers, molding methods, etc. In practice, we often focus on a subset of the parameters while keeping other fixed to reduce the enormous search space. For example, Wu et al. focused on the design of monomer that has a high probability of making liquid crystal polymers with high thermal conductivity after compressed to a polymer thin film. 15\n",

In order to achieve a fully data-driven process of polymer design, continuous efforts have been made to bridge the demand of machine learning technologies and the current state of polymer informatics. In this paper, we review and discuss the applications of machine learning on different aspects of the polymer design process through four perspectives: polymer databases, representation (descriptor) of polymers, predictive models for polymer properties, and polymer design strategy. Illustrative examples are also given using the open- source materials informatics software, XenonPy.18 We hope that this paper can serve as an entry point for researchers interested in the field of polymer informatics, who may be coming from any of the scientific fields covered by polymer informatics.\n",

Therefore, high quality large database for a diverse set of polymers is always of high demand in polymer informatics. Table 1 shows a list of online databases that contain polymer data.

      "\n",
      "The fundamental purpose of a material descriptor is to uniquely encode materials in a com- pact form in order to allow for efficient machine learning. This is particularly difficult for polymers due to their hierarchical structures. 30 An example of unique representation of polymers would be the Polymer Markup Language, which is designed to include complete information of a polymer ranging from compositional information to all the processing pa- rameters.31 While this representation may be suitable for building polymer databases, it is not compact enough to be used as input of a model for machine learning purposes. In fact, a good material descriptor should consider the tradeoff between ability to uniquely represent a material, easiness to obtain or calculate, and sensitivity to targeted application. 32 In other words, while possible, it is unlikely that a single descriptor can be used for all polymer ap- plications. For example, to search for an efficient polyimide for controlled inkjet deposition, descriptor needs to be sensitive to specific microstructures formed by the polymer chains. 33 On the other hand, designing polymers with certain phase transition properties will require a descriptor that identifies key atomic-level structures. Different level of \"fineness\" of de- scriptor should be selected depending on the physical and chemical properties of interest to the target problem. 34 One example that attempted to capture such hierarchy of descriptor in a Python package is the Materials knowledge systems. 35 Here, we introduce and compare a few descriptors that could be useful in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing conditions of polymers, such as temperature, additives and solvents, can be directly included in a descriptor. Representations of the microstructure and molecular struc- ture of polymer chains are less intuitive. Certain machine learning models in deep learning allow direct use of images as input, but often require a significant amount of data to train the models. 36 Persistant homology is a technique to extract statistical features from topo- logical structures, 37 but its application in polymer informatics is yet to be investigated. Graphical kernel is another option to numerically encode the polymer structures that can be represented in a simple graph. 38 However, finding an efficient graph representation for\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "\n",
      "the complex polymer structures is challenging, especially because different types of polymer chains can form structures in different length scales. Many of the descriptors commonly used in polymer informatics focus on capturing the molecular structure of monomers composing the polymer chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Material descriptors or fingerprints developed for small organic molecules are directly applicable to represent polymers based on their monomers. Modern machine learning al- gorithms also allow direct use of molecular graph or simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) 39 strings as input of a model. 40 Picking a descriptor suitable for the prob- lem of interest may significantly improves the efficiency of machine learning. 34 However, such representation omits information about the chemical bonds between the monomers. An al- ternative is to consider oligmer consisting of n monomers, but there is no clear answer to how to pick n. The larger n is, the more representative the oligmer would be to the polymer. Nevertheless, certain types of descriptors, such as the physical descriptors, will take signifi- cantly longer time to calculate for a larger molecule. Furthermore, some fingerprints could be biased toward polymers with smaller or larger monomers depending on the choice of n. For example, a fingerprint that counts if there are more than 3 benzene rings in a molecule will not be able to distinguish between polystyrene and poly(bisphenol A carbonate) when n > 3. Figure 3 shows how different fingerprints may have different convergence behavior with respect to n. Wu et al. proposed to calculate descriptor of polymers using an infinitely long chain of their corresponding monomers. 19 However, the bias issue for some fingerprints remains unsolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymer chain can be separated into a backbone and its side chains. Distinguishing the two components is theoretically important to predict polymer properties. However, it is not clear how to efficiently encode such information into a general descriptor for different classes of polymers. Similarly, developing descriptors for polymers consisting of more than one type of monomer is still an open challenge. For alternating copolymer, we can simply consider the combined repeating unit of multiple monomers as a \"metamonomer\", but the molecule\n",

Some of the important properties often considered in the polymer industry include transparency, glass transition temperature, toughness, etc.41 The ability to predict properties of different classes of polymers opens up new computational design approaches for polymers, such as high-throughput screening and inverse design, which will be discussed in the next section. One approach to predict polymer properties is building empirical equations based on physical descriptors and some basic properties of polymers.\n",

      "\n",
      "An effort to collect such equations in Python has been made by the thermo package. 42 This approach can be very powerful, but could be difficult to use when predicting properties for a new design with not much knowledge available yet. Another approach that is more suitable for design purpose, called the quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) modeling, aims at mapping structural descriptors of a material to its property. In particular, models that rely only on 2D structure information of the polymer is preferred as it avoids intensive geometry optimization for the polymer molecules. To date, around 300 articles can be found on the web of science database when searching with keywords QSPR and polymer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Group contribution method is one of the earliest data-driven approaches to predict com- plex properties of different polymers.3 The basic idea is that certain groups of bonded atoms within different molecules may have common effects on a specific material property. Linear regression is used to model the interaction between groups when data is limited, but higher order models can also be used. Machine learning models using fingerprints as input can be seen as an extension to this idea, since the fingerprints are collections of rules that check the existence of different structural groups. Some commonly used models include elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, Gaussian process, neural network, etc. Table 2 summarizes some recent applications of these algorithms in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning models are inherently interpolative, i.e., their predictions are reliable only around the domain close to the training data. The range of properties prediction for certain types of polymers with a reasonable accuracy governs the potential search space one can cover, i.e., the performance of the final design. In other words, the training data determines the feasible design space of the target application. The concept of applicability domain (AD) developed in Cheminformatics is used to quantify the reliable region of a QSPR model. 49 The concept of uncertainty in statistics is also a popular metric believed to be strongly correlated with the validity of a prediction. 50 Figure 4 shows how different models fail to predict different materials properties when extrapolating from the given data.

Instead, polymer informatics has been used to improve design effi- ciency within each step of of the polymer design process. For example, Wu et al. discovered new homopolymers with high thermal conductivity that are validated experimentally 15 and Li et al. developed an algorithm that discovers optimal strategy to experimentally control MWDs of various polymers.22 There are three types of design strategies based on machine learning technology: high-throughput screening, inverse design, and experimental design.

Fragment can be obtained from organic molecules which have more large open databases, such as GDB-1756 or Pub- chem. 57 To expand beyond the search space limited by a finite variety of fragments, Wu et al. implemented a language model proposed by Ikebata et al. 59 on polymers represented in SMILES.58 Different deep neural networks are also used to learn the SMILES or graph representation of organic molecules. 60-62\n",

For sampling, the likeliness metric is usually correlated with the probability of observing the candidates conditional on the targeted properties.\n",

It is important that an inverse design algorithm can produce a diverse set of candidates in order to maximize the probability of discovering novel functional materials. Typical optimization algorithm can only search for the optimal solution. Sampling methods can have a higher chance to provide diverse candidates, but can also be trapped in a local mode, especial when the search space is high dimensional.

      "approach of polymer design will significantly improve the pace of making new functional polymers, satisfying the rapidly expanding demand on polymeric materials in modern society (e.g., deformable electronic devices74). One of the most important elements of polymer informatics is the availability of large open databases. Building such databases for polymer is challenging because of many reasons: (1) difficulty of encoding the hierarchical structure of polymers for machine learning purposes, (2) inconsistent naming rules throughout the history of polymer science, (3) lack of data sharing due to many privately own industrial data, etc. Nonetheless, this is an essential step towards a fully data-driven design process. Many efforts have been made to build the backbone technologies necessary to exploit the potential benefit of polymer informatics, such as developing new descriptors to better capture the physical properties of polymers and new simulation methods to estimate polymer properties with higher accuracy in a shorter time. The true power of polymer informatics is to release polymer scientists from the low efficiency trial-and-error design process, thus, to free up more time for higher level design concepts and theoretical advancements. Such opportunity can be realized only if we work together to push for a more open community in polymer science, where everyone can benefit from the new paradigm of polymer design. An easy first step to take would be to engage in the field of polymer informatics and experience the new way of studying polymers ourselves.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials. Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, as well as how to automatically develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Specifically, our pipeline for polymer property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations with a sizable 20% average reduction in prediction error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding periodicity into our polymer graph representation is responsible for a considerable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while achieving better predictive performance than human-derived features. Whereas previous polymer informatics have typically utilized hand-designed descriptors that have been optimized for representing molecules, this work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The complex chemical structure of polymers provides chemists with an unprecedented level of chemical design opportunities. As a result, efforts focused on the rational design of polymers has led to their use in a remarkably wide range of applications.1,2 By varying a polymer's monomer structure, its propagation site, or the polymer chain length, the properties of the polymer can be tuned to suit the application of interest.3 6 Formulations of polymers with chemical additives adds an even richer potential design and functional space. However, efficiently navigating this vast chemical design space to identify promising polymer materials for a given application is incredibly challenging. Recently, the field of polymer informatics has shown much promise in tackling this challenge by utilizing machine learning (ML) models to learn the complex structure-property relationships of polymers.7,8 Through the development of increasingly accurate ML models, one can envision the future possibility of fully computational polymer design workflows whereby polymers can be rapidly designed in silico to satisfy multiple property criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate machine learning models require that the input to the model - be it an image, text, or chemical structure - is transformed into a machine-readable format that captures and represents all relevant features of the input. The development of suitable polymer representations to use as inputs for machine learning algorithms has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in the field of polymer informatics.9,10 Unlike molecules that consist of a fixed number of atoms and typically only contain dozens of atoms, a given polymer can consist of a periodic chain of between 100-106 repeating chemical sub-units.11\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents a considerable challenge for creating machine-readable polymer representations since they must encode the periodic nature of the polymer structure and also be compact enough to represent up to millions of atoms. Despite these challenges, previous work on small molecules and crystalline solids has demonstrated that developing physically-inspired representations of atomistic systems is a fruitful direction towards realizing significant improvements in property prediction accuracy.12-15\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we develop a new polymer representation that is the first to explicitly capture the periodic nature of polymeric materials. First, we show that the widely used monomer-based representations cannot sufficiently describe the periodic, extended structure of polymers and can result in unreliable property predictions. To solve this issue, we have developed a novel polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph and that naturally incorporates polymers' periodicity in its construction. Across a diverse spectrum of 10 unique polymer properties, we find that our polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous monomer-based representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction error. Finally, we demonstrate how our polymer graph representations can be combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework to automatically extract chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from a dataset of polymer properties. We find that these MPNN-learned polymer features yield more accurate property predictions than predetermined features that have been hand-crafted by chemists over years.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, a wide range of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately predict polymer properties in an a priori manner.16,17 These previous approaches typically represent polymers by their monomer repeat unit which is then converted into either i) molecular descriptors that includes the presence of molecular fragments and/or property descriptors (such as the molecular weight of the molecule)18-20 or ii) a molecular graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds are represented as edges (Figure 1a)).17 It should be noted that these representations were first developed for molecules before being transferred to the field of polymer informatics. Although these monomer-based representations perform well at representing finite molecules, we show in this work that monomer-based representations cannot adequately represent the extended chain structures that define polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using monomer-based representations as inputs for ML algorithms results in at least three notable issues: i) the generation of non-unique representations for polymers that are composed of the similar monomer repeat units (see \"monomer graphs\" of Polymer A and B in Figure 1 c), ii) incorrect bonding environment of the polymer, and iii) a lack of periodicity. Polymers A and B in Figure 1c) are two distinct polymers with notably different chemical structures and properties. Since the monomer of a polymer is defined as the smallest repeat unit of the polymer chain, the monomer of the two polymers in Figure 1 c) is therefore the same C-C-O subunit (or CH3 CH2OH if including hydrogen atoms). Regardless of the specific details of the featurization used, generating a representation of Polymer A and B based only on their monomers will result in two identical representations (see Supplementary Note 1). In turn, an ML algorithm that then uses these representations to learn a structure-property relationship will, at best, only be able to learn the average value of the property across the polymers, which may lead to large prediction errors. The second issue that will arise from the use of monomer-based representations is the incorrect featurization of the polymer. Polymer B consists of a repeating (-C-C-O-) backbone, which is characterized by an ether functional group (R-O-R, where R is any alkane). However, the monomer of Polymer B ( C-C-O) does not contain an ether functional group since this ether group is artificially fragmented when forming the monomer representation. This is particularly problematic since both fingerprinting approaches and property descriptors utilize the presence of functional groups and connectivity in their representations (Supplementary Note 1).21-23 Thirdly, the failure to include periodicity in these monomer-based representations results in representations that are inconsistent due to trivial translations along the polymer backbone. The polymer (-C-C-O-)n can also be written as (-C-O-C-)n by translating all atoms one position along the polymer chain. However, the monomer representations for these two equivalent polymer representations would be C-C-O and C-O-C, respectively. As shown in this example, the failure to explicitly account for periodicity in these monomer-based representations can result in inconsistent featurizations, which can negatively impact the ability of ML algorithms to learn the underlying structure-property relationships. These inconsistent featurizations are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamentally, all three of the aforementioned problems arise due to a failure to account for the periodic nature of polymers. In other words, a finite molecule (i.e. a monomer) cannot be used to represent a continuous, extended chain of atoms without fragmenting chemical bonds in an unphysical manner. We note that featurizing Polymers A and B by generating dimers (or any larger oligomer chain) instead of monomers results in unique representations. Using a dimer representation, however, still results in incorrect featurizations due to the incomplete bonding environment of the atoms at the terminal end of the dimer.\n",

      "Polymers are one of the most important classes of material in modern society, as its applica- tions range from the plastic bags and bottles used in daily life to a variety of electronics, and even structural components in the aerospace industry. A polymer is a material made of a col- lection of chains that are built by connecting many repeated units, called monomers. These chains can form diverse structures that contribute to the highly diverse physical and chemi- cal properties of different types of polymers. Some polymers can be consisting of more than one type of monomer to form even more complicated topological structures across different length scales. The research field of polymer science and engineering emerged to understand, control, and design novel polymers that can be used to satisfy the rapidly growing demand on highly functional materials coming from different aspects of modern life. While polymers can be categorized into natural or synthetic polymers, we will focus our discussion on the latter in this paper.\n",

      "Following the mainstream of materials science, polymer science has gone through mul- tiple major paradigm shifts. The early studies of polymers flourished in the first half of the 20th century was closely associated with H. Staudinger who received the Nobel Prize in 1953.1 Initially, discovery of polymers was mainly based on an empirical approach, i.e., relying on many trial-and-error experiments. Accumulation of experimental experiences has led to developments of theoretical and simple statistical models for guiding the design of new\n",

Flory, the group contribution method and so on.2-4 Following the rapid advances of computing power in the last few decades, computational methods has become one of the main tools to study properties of polymers.5 Recent developments of simulation techniques for vari- ous types of polymers opened up opportunities to computationally study polymers across different length scales. 6,7 While generating experimental data of polymers is often costly and time-consuming, modern supercomputers provide new opportunities for building larger databases of polymers computationally. With the drastic expansion of data size in science, a data-driven approach for scientific discovery is said to be the 4th paradigm of science. Poly- mer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to mine the precious polymer data for new knowledge. Yet, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics attributed to the complex hierarchical structures of polymers. 8,9\n",

      "Design of a polymer can be broken down into three parts corresponding to the three steps in the typical production process of polymers: design of monomers (polymerization), microstructures (crystallization), and material processing (manufacturing) (see Figure 1). Monomers, the building blocks of polymers, contribute to the foundation of potential prop- erties of the eventually produced polymers. While molecular size is one of the important factors that influences the properties of an organic material, the \"size effect\" of polymers is not directly correlated with the size of the monomers because a large collection of small monomers (e.g., ethylene) can also build long polymer chains the same way large monomers do. Instead, various metrics based on the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of a poly- mer are often used as a reference to relate the \"size of polymer\" to polymer properties. Different polymers built from the same monomer can have different MWD by controlling the polymerization process, which can lead to significantly different physical and chemical properties. 10-12 Furthermore, the collection of polymer chains can form very different crystal structures through a variety of crystallization processes, affecting the material properties of\n",

      "the resulting polymers. For example, Yi et al. controlled the crystallinity and orientation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) molecules to optimize the performance of solar cells. 13 Finally, the same type of polymer in the microscopic scale can undergo different manufacturing pro- cess, such as stretching or mixing additives, to further enhance or alter its properties in order to fulfil specific needs from a broad range of applications. 14 Ideally, the design space of polymers covers all parameters involved in the three production steps, for example, the molecule space of a single or multiple monomer(s) (namely homopolymers or copolymers, respectively), temperature and types of polymerization process, additives or fillers, molding methods, etc. In practice, we often focus on a subset of the parameters while keeping other fixed to reduce the enormous search space. For example, Wu et al. focused on the design of monomer that has a high probability of making liquid crystal polymers with high thermal conductivity after compressed to a polymer thin film. 15\n",

      "One of the most important components in machine learning is data. The quality and quantity of available data determine the scope of solvable problems in an application. A rule of thumb in machine learning is that purely data-driven models are not reliable when extrapolating. In other words, it is dangerous to trust the prediction of a model on a material that is not similar to the ones in the training data. Therefore, high quality large database for a diverse set of polymers is always of high demand in polymer informatics. Table 1 shows a list of online databases that contain polymer data. There also exists large amount of publications on polymer technology or database that collects recipes of polymer synthesis (e.g., NIST Synthetic Polymer MALDI Recipes Database23).

These issues have become the bottleneck for the development of polymer informatics.8 With the advancements of computational simulation technologies and supercomputers, we expect an increasing interest and opportunity to build large scale com- putational databases of polymers. Meanwhile, technology of high-throughput experiments 28 and the use of robotics combined with artificial intelligence29 provide new opportunities to build experimental database of polymers efficiently.

      "\n",
      "The fundamental purpose of a material descriptor is to uniquely encode materials in a com- pact form in order to allow for efficient machine learning. This is particularly difficult for polymers due to their hierarchical structures. 30 An example of unique representation of polymers would be the Polymer Markup Language, which is designed to include complete information of a polymer ranging from compositional information to all the processing pa- rameters.31 While this representation may be suitable for building polymer databases, it is not compact enough to be used as input of a model for machine learning purposes. In fact, a good material descriptor should consider the tradeoff between ability to uniquely represent a material, easiness to obtain or calculate, and sensitivity to targeted application. 32 In other words, while possible, it is unlikely that a single descriptor can be used for all polymer ap- plications. For example, to search for an efficient polyimide for controlled inkjet deposition, descriptor needs to be sensitive to specific microstructures formed by the polymer chains. 33 On the other hand, designing polymers with certain phase transition properties will require a descriptor that identifies key atomic-level structures. Different level of \"fineness\" of de- scriptor should be selected depending on the physical and chemical properties of interest to the target problem. 34 One example that attempted to capture such hierarchy of descriptor in a Python package is the Materials knowledge systems. 35 Here, we introduce and compare a few descriptors that could be useful in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing conditions of polymers, such as temperature, additives and solvents, can be directly included in a descriptor. Representations of the microstructure and molecular struc- ture of polymer chains are less intuitive. Certain machine learning models in deep learning allow direct use of images as input, but often require a significant amount of data to train the models. 36 Persistant homology is a technique to extract statistical features from topo- logical structures, 37 but its application in polymer informatics is yet to be investigated. Graphical kernel is another option to numerically encode the polymer structures that can be represented in a simple graph. 38 However, finding an efficient graph representation for\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "\n",
      "the complex polymer structures is challenging, especially because different types of polymer chains can form structures in different length scales. Many of the descriptors commonly used in polymer informatics focus on capturing the molecular structure of monomers composing the polymer chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Material descriptors or fingerprints developed for small organic molecules are directly applicable to represent polymers based on their monomers. Modern machine learning al- gorithms also allow direct use of molecular graph or simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) 39 strings as input of a model. 40 Picking a descriptor suitable for the prob- lem of interest may significantly improves the efficiency of machine learning. 34 However, such representation omits information about the chemical bonds between the monomers. An al- ternative is to consider oligmer consisting of n monomers, but there is no clear answer to how to pick n. The larger n is, the more representative the oligmer would be to the polymer. Nevertheless, certain types of descriptors, such as the physical descriptors, will take signifi- cantly longer time to calculate for a larger molecule. Furthermore, some fingerprints could be biased toward polymers with smaller or larger monomers depending on the choice of n. For example, a fingerprint that counts if there are more than 3 benzene rings in a molecule will not be able to distinguish between polystyrene and poly(bisphenol A carbonate) when n > 3. Figure 3 shows how different fingerprints may have different convergence behavior with respect to n.

One approach to predict polymer properties is building empirical equations based on physical descriptors and some basic properties of polymers.\n",

Another approach that is more suitable for design purpose, called the quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) modeling, aims at mapping structural descriptors of a material to its property. In particular, models that rely only on 2D structure information of the polymer is preferred as it avoids intensive geometry optimization for the polymer molecules. To date, around 300 articles can be found on the web of science database when searching with keywords QSPR and polymer.\n",

      "Group contribution method is one of the earliest data-driven approaches to predict com- plex properties of different polymers.3 The basic idea is that certain groups of bonded atoms within different molecules may have common effects on a specific material property. Linear regression is used to model the interaction between groups when data is limited, but higher order models can also be used. Machine learning models using fingerprints as input can be seen as an extension to this idea, since the fingerprints are collections of rules that check the existence of different structural groups. Some commonly used models include elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, Gaussian process, neural network, etc. Table 2 summarizes some recent applications of these algorithms in polymer informatics.\n",

      "Machine learning models are inherently interpolative, i.e., their predictions are reliable only around the domain close to the training data. The range of properties prediction for certain types of polymers with a reasonable accuracy governs the potential search space one can cover, i.e., the performance of the final design. In other words, the training data determines the feasible design space of the target application. The concept of applicability domain (AD) developed in Cheminformatics is used to quantify the reliable region of a QSPR model. 49 The concept of uncertainty in statistics is also a popular metric believed to be strongly correlated with the validity of a prediction. 50 Figure 4 shows how different models fail to predict different materials properties when extrapolating from the given data.

      "Experimental design algorithm is the ideal solution when we do not have a large enough polymer database to begin with. However, polymer experiments are costly and syntheses of new polymers are difficult. Computational simulations are becoming more and more accessi- ble, yet calculations for new polymers often required labor-intensive tuning of model param- eters. Automatic simulation, synthetic planning, and property measurement for polymers remain challenging and are continuously explored by researchers in polymer informatics.\n",

      "approach of polymer design will significantly improve the pace of making new functional polymers, satisfying the rapidly expanding demand on polymeric materials in modern society (e.g., deformable electronic devices74). One of the most important elements of polymer informatics is the availability of large open databases. Building such databases for polymer is challenging because of many reasons: (1) difficulty of encoding the hierarchical structure of polymers for machine learning purposes, (2) inconsistent naming rules throughout the history of polymer science, (3) lack of data sharing due to many privately own industrial data, etc. Nonetheless, this is an essential step towards a fully data-driven design process. Many efforts have been made to build the backbone technologies necessary to exploit the potential benefit of polymer informatics, such as developing new descriptors to better capture the physical properties of polymers and new simulation methods to estimate polymer properties with higher accuracy in a shorter time. The true power of polymer informatics is to release polymer scientists from the low efficiency trial-and-error design process, thus, to free up more time for higher level design concepts and theoretical advancements. Such opportunity can be realized only if we work together to push for a more open community in polymer science, where everyone can benefit from the new paradigm of polymer design. An easy first step to take would be to engage in the field of polymer informatics and experience the new way of studying polymers ourselves.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials. Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, as well as how to automatically develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Specifically, our pipeline for polymer property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations with a sizable 20% average reduction in prediction error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding periodicity into our polymer graph representation is responsible for a considerable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while achieving better predictive performance than human-derived features. Whereas previous polymer informatics have typically utilized hand-designed descriptors that have been optimized for representing molecules, this work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The complex chemical structure of polymers provides chemists with an unprecedented level of chemical design opportunities. As a result, efforts focused on the rational design of polymers has led to their use in a remarkably wide range of applications.1,2 By varying a polymer's monomer structure, its propagation site, or the polymer chain length, the properties of the polymer can be tuned to suit the application of interest.3 6 Formulations of polymers with chemical additives adds an even richer potential design and functional space. However, efficiently navigating this vast chemical design space to identify promising polymer materials for a given application is incredibly challenging. Recently, the field of polymer informatics has shown much promise in tackling this challenge by utilizing machine learning (ML) models to learn the complex structure-property relationships of polymers.7,8 Through the development of increasingly accurate ML models, one can envision the future possibility of fully computational polymer design workflows whereby polymers can be rapidly designed in silico to satisfy multiple property criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate machine learning models require that the input to the model - be it an image, text, or chemical structure - is transformed into a machine-readable format that captures and represents all relevant features of the input. The development of suitable polymer representations to use as inputs for machine learning algorithms has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in the field of polymer informatics.9,10 Unlike molecules that consist of a fixed number of atoms and typically only contain dozens of atoms, a given polymer can consist of a periodic chain of between 100-106 repeating chemical sub-units.11\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents a considerable challenge for creating machine-readable polymer representations since they must encode the periodic nature of the polymer structure and also be compact enough to represent up to millions of atoms. Despite these challenges, previous work on small molecules and crystalline solids has demonstrated that developing physically-inspired representations of atomistic systems is a fruitful direction towards realizing significant improvements in property prediction accuracy.12-15\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we develop a new polymer representation that is the first to explicitly capture the periodic nature of polymeric materials. First, we show that the widely used monomer-based representations cannot sufficiently describe the periodic, extended structure of polymers and can result in unreliable property predictions. To solve this issue, we have developed a novel polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph and that naturally incorporates polymers' periodicity in its construction. Across a diverse spectrum of 10 unique polymer properties, we find that our polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous monomer-based representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction error. Finally, we demonstrate how our polymer graph representations can be combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework to automatically extract chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from a dataset of polymer properties. We find that these MPNN-learned polymer features yield more accurate property predictions than predetermined features that have been hand-crafted by chemists over years.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, a wide range of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately predict polymer properties in an a priori manner.16,17 These previous approaches typically represent polymers by their monomer repeat unit which is then converted into either i) molecular descriptors that includes the presence of molecular fragments and/or property descriptors (such as the molecular weight of the molecule)18-20 or ii) a molecular graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds are represented as edges (Figure 1a)).17 It should be noted that these representations were first developed for molecules before being transferred to the field of polymer informatics. Although these monomer-based representations perform well at representing finite molecules, we show in this work that monomer-based representations cannot adequately represent the extended chain structures that define polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using monomer-based representations as inputs for ML algorithms results in at least three notable issues: i) the generation of non-unique representations for polymers that are composed of the similar monomer repeat units (see \"monomer graphs\" of Polymer A and B in Figure 1 c), ii) incorrect bonding environment of the polymer, and iii) a lack of periodicity. Polymers A and B in Figure 1c) are two distinct polymers with notably different chemical structures and properties. Since the monomer of a polymer is defined as the smallest repeat unit of the polymer chain, the monomer of the two polymers in Figure 1 c) is therefore the same C-C-O subunit (or CH3 CH2OH if including hydrogen atoms). Regardless of the specific details of the featurization used, generating a representation of Polymer A and B based only on their monomers will result in two identical representations (see Supplementary Note 1). In turn, an ML algorithm that then uses these representations to learn a structure-property relationship will, at best, only be able to learn the average value of the property across the polymers, which may lead to large prediction errors. The second issue that will arise from the use of monomer-based representations is the incorrect featurization of the polymer. Polymer B consists of a repeating (-C-C-O-) backbone, which is characterized by an ether functional group (R-O-R, where R is any alkane). However, the monomer of Polymer B ( C-C-O) does not contain an ether functional group since this ether group is artificially fragmented when forming the monomer representation. This is particularly problematic since both fingerprinting approaches and property descriptors utilize the presence of functional groups and connectivity in their representations (Supplementary Note 1).21-23 Thirdly, the failure to include periodicity in these monomer-based representations results in representations that are inconsistent due to trivial translations along the polymer backbone. The polymer (-C-C-O-)n can also be written as (-C-O-C-)n by translating all atoms one position along the polymer chain. However, the monomer representations for these two equivalent polymer representations would be C-C-O and C-O-C, respectively. As shown in this example, the failure to explicitly account for periodicity in these monomer-based representations can result in inconsistent featurizations, which can negatively impact the ability of ML algorithms to learn the underlying structure-property relationships. These inconsistent featurizations are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamentally, all three of the aforementioned problems arise due to a failure to account for the periodic nature of polymers. In other words, a finite molecule (i.e. a monomer) cannot be used to represent a continuous, extended chain of atoms without fragmenting chemical bonds in an unphysical manner. We note that featurizing Polymers A and B by generating dimers (or any larger oligomer chain) instead of monomers results in unique representations. Using a dimer representation, however, still results in incorrect featurizations due to the incomplete bonding environment of the atoms at the terminal end of the dimer.\n",

      "One significant barrier in polymer informatics is accurately representing the complex structures of polymers for machine learning applications. Conventional monomer-based representations have limitations because they do not account for the periodic nature of polymers and can result in non-unique and incorrect representations. In the paper by Evan R. Antoniuk, Peggy Li, Bhavya Kailkhura, and Anna M. Hiszpanski, the researchers address this challenge by introducing a new polymer graph representation that captures the periodicity of polymers. This representation is used in conjunction with a message-passing neural network (MPNN) to automatically learn chemically-relevant descriptors from data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their methodology led to an average reduction of 20% in the prediction error for a broad spectrum of polymer properties when compared to previous approaches. This demonstrates the benefit of directly encoding chemical intuition, specifically the periodic nature of polymers, into polymer graph representations for improving the accuracy of predictions in polymer informatics. The authors also show that MPNN-learned features outperform traditional hand-crafted features, highlighting the potential of using advanced machine learning techniques for predicting polymer properties and aiding the design of new polymers.\n",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches are beginning to impact several domains of human life, science and technology. Polymer informatics is one such domain where AI and machine learning (ML) tools are being used in the efficient development, design and discovery of polymers. Surrogate models are trained on avail- able polymer data for instant property prediction, allowing screening of promising polymer candidates with specific target property requirements. Questions regarding synthesizability, and potential (retro)synthesis steps to create a target polymer, are being explored using statistical means. Data-driven strategies to tackle unique challenges resulting from the extraordinary chemical and physical diversity of polymers at small and large scales are being explored. Other major hurdles for polymer informatics are the lack of widespread availability of curated and organized data, and approaches to create machine-readable representations that capture not just the structure of complex polymeric situations but also synthesis and processing condi- tions. Methods to solve inverse problems, wherein polymer recommendations are made using advanced AI algorithms that meet application targets, are being investigated. As various parts of the burgeoning poly- mer informatics ecosystem mature and become integrated, efficiency improvements, accelerated discoveries and increased productivity can result. Here, we review emergent components of this polymer informatics ecosystem and discuss imminent challenges and opportunities.\n",

      "Over the course of less than a century, polymers have become pervasive in everyday life and high- technology [1-10]. Mass production of niche polymers, such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene, has outstripped the production scale of iron and steel, which have been the staple materials for millennia [11]. Different parts of the practically infinite chemical space of polymers display a dizzying variety of distinctive properties, which can be tuned exquisitely through control of their chemical and morphological structure [1, 2]. Extensive efforts have been devoted to searching the chemical space and tinkering with their structure and chemistry to optimize their properties for specific applications. Traditional intuition-driven and/or trial-and-error approaches have already revealed the promise that the polymer class of materials holds. Nevertheless, given the vastness of the chemical and structural space, new methods are required to effectively and efficiently search this space to identify optimal, application-specific solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The field of polymer informatics attempts to address this daunting search problem by the utilization of modern data- and information-centric approaches, inspired by emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods [12-19]. Polymer informatics efforts are seeing heightened activity and successes in recent years [19-25], but many of the ideas and concepts have gradually taken shape over a period of decades [19-21, 24, 26].\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1 illustrates the essential elements of polymer informatics. The first vital ingredient is the polymer data, derived from experiments and (high-throughput) computations. Unlike hard materials, only limited well-organized/clean polymer data is available to be used for ML or AI-based techniques, e.g., in polymer handbooks [27] and online repositories [28]. Large volumes of experimental data remain trapped in the scientific literature, which is occasionally mined via laborious manual excerption. An emerging alternative approach is natural language processing (NLP) to continuously and dynamically extract polymer data, but significant future efforts are needed to effectively and accurately extract polymer data from literature. An- other important resource of polymer data is high-throughput computations using density functional theory (DFT) [29-31] and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [32-39]. The recent development of au- tonomous computational agents, composed of machine learning modules and high-throughput computations, holds great promise for polymer data generation [40].\n",

      "The second important component of polymer informatics is a suitable framework to create machine- readable polymer representations. Linear notations are commonly adopted to describe the chemical in- formation of polymers, for instance, using Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) [41]. With SMILES as input, polymers are either directly fingerprinted using hierarchical polymer fingerprints [22, 23] or molecular fingerprints [42, 43] that are widely used in cheminformatics. Alternatively, optimal fingerprint representation (or latent knowledge) of polymers can be obtained using variational [44] or graph autoencoders [45, 46]. Designing fingerprints that fully capture not just the chemical and morphological information of polymers, but also how they were synthesized and processed is one of the most challenging parts of polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the numerical polymer fingerprints and target property data as input, we move to the third part of the polymer informatics: polymer property prediction and design. In the former, various machine learning algorithms, e.g., non-linear regression [22], multi-fidelity information fusion [47, 48] and deep neural networks [43, 49], can be applied to learn the relationship between polymer fingerprints and their target property, resulting in a surrogate property prediction model for polymers. The developed surrogate model can instantly predict various properties of new polymers defined by the user. Another key benefit of the polymer informatics ecosystem is to accelerate the discovery of polymers with target properties for various applications. Several polymer design algorithms have been proposed, e.g., screening candidates based on the ML predicted properties from a huge list of enumerated polymers, iteratively selecting the next interesting polymer using active learning, and producing desired hypothetical polymers using genetic or generative deep learning algorithms. These design approaches have significantly accelerated the polymer design process for capacitors [50-52], membrane separation [42], organic solar cells [53], among others.\n",

Attempts are being made to expedite this process by using AI-assisted synthesis planning and robotic/autonomous (retro)synthesis. Although computer-aided synthesis design for molecules was recently accomplished [54, 55], there remains lots of scope and challenges for polymer synthesis planning, which is expected to blossom rapidly in the next several years. Moreover, the data obtained from these synthesized polymers and/or from their computations can be added into existing polymer repositories to re-optimize ML models and re-design or re-imagine the next experiments.\n",

      "A reliable and enormous data resource for polymer data is the scientific literature, including printed handbooks [56-59], online repositories [28] and journal articles. As listed in Table 1, polymer handbooks, such as the Polymer Handbook [56] and Properties of Polymers [58], are introductory materials containing chemical, property and synthesis information on polymers. More recently, several polymer databases have been digitalized, allowing for easy access to polymer data. A few representative databases include PoLyInfo supported by the National Institute for Materials Science of Japan (NIMS) [28], CROW Polymer Property Database [60], Polymers: A property database [61], CAMPUS [62], LANDOLT-BORNSTEIN [63] and Polymer Property Predictor and Database (NIST) [64]. In contrast to the field of inorganic materials, only a few computation-based property databases for polymers are available. This can be attributed to the high computational complexity of polymers due to their complicated physical and chemical structures. A good example of a database of computational data polymers is Khazana [65], which includes DFT computed band gap, dielectric constant, refractive index and charge injection barriers. The third important resource of polymer data is the ever-increasing corpus of published journal articles.\n",

      "Timely dynamical extraction of polymer data from the literature in a machine-readable format can be challenging and is achieved using either the laborious manual excerption and/or machine-learning methods usually classified as NLP. Manual text excerption refers to the old-fashioned procedure of collecting data from the literature and entails laborious efforts for data extraction, validation, and normalization owing to the absence of standard journal policies for publishing polymer data. Nonetheless, researchers have painstakingly collected important information on polymer types, their chemical structures (repeat units), names and class, their properties (e.g., physical, thermal, mechanical, dielectric, physicochemical and solution properties), and their synthesis recipes (e.g., polymerization paths, reactants and reagents) [28, 56-59]. Crucially, easy access to the resulting databases has been provided through online repositories, as discussed earlier.\n",

Several initial attempts have tried to use NLP to collect materials synthesis recipes, capture latent knowledge and to even predict potentially superior thermoelectrics [18, 67, 68]. These successes motivate the further application of NLP in polymer informatics, such as the extraction of properties, synthesis recipes or processing conditions from past literature. Despite initial success, many unique challenges are posed in the case of polymers, for example, non-uniform polymer names. More details are described in Section 7.\n",

      "High-throughput computations using first-principles theory and classical MD are important approaches to amass polymer data. However, this task is non-trivial because of the enormously complicated chemical and physical structures of polymers at the atomic scale; polymers usually display either amorphous or semi- crystalline phases. Given the expensive computational cost of first-principles computations, small length- scale models (< 100 atoms) have been developed to represent polymers and approximate their physical, electronic and dielectric properties [29-31, 40, 51]. The computed results, however, generally suffer from certain accuracy issues depending on the methodology. To model polymers in the large-scale, classical MD with empirical force fields have been applied to study the structural dynamics [69-76] and diverse properties (e.g., dielectric, thermal, mechanical and ion transport properties) [32, 34, 35, 37, 38, 71, 77-82] of polymers. However, such parameterization schemes are also restricted by the availability of force fields and the high computational cost to simulate very large systems (> thousands of atoms).\n",

      "Balancing the trade-off between cost and accuracy, past efforts have led to the computation of the elec- tronic, dielectric and optical properties (such as band gap, charge injection barriers and dielectric constant) of thousands of polymers using DFT [29-31, 40, 83]. A hierarchy of models, i.e., single-chain, pure crystal and amorphous, has been developed to represent realistic polymers, as shown in Figure 2a). The simplest single-chain model is composed of only a chain of monomers in vacuum, while crystal and amorphous models represent the crystalline and amorphous regions of polymers, respectively. In spite of this simplification, the creation of correct low-energy crystalline structure of a polymer, especially for novel polymers, remains a major challenge [40]. To address this issue, Huan et al. developed a general computational workflow, referred to as polymer structure predictor (PSP), to predict crystal structures of linear polymers. In this workflow, a polymer is defined in terms of its chemical composition and atomic connectivity, using the SMILES notation (more details in Section 3). Reasonable single-chain and crystal models of the polymer can be predicted/created [40] using this scheme. Such efforts have led to formation of the largest dataset for polymers using computations, which can be accessed from https://khazana.gatech.edu. Some of the important computed properties include the crystal band gap, single-chain band gap, charge injection barri- ers, atomization energy, ionization energy, electron affinity, dielectric constant and refractive index [29, 40]. Other researchers have spent extensive efforts on estimating thermal conductivity [78, 79, 84, 85], Young's\n",

As visualized in Figure 2b), by utilizing the available (seed) computational dataset, machine-learning models are developed with the capability to instantly predict target properties for a large number of new polymers. Candidate polymers that meet the desired properties are selected, followed by a \"3D structure\" conversion step (involving generation of hierarchical models as shown in Figure 2a)). The newly created structures are then modeled using high-throughput calculations, and the obtained results are added to the seed dataset iteratively. This autonomous platform is applicable for single or multiple polymer property predictions, and offers an efficient way to discover/design polymers with desired performances.\n",

Variations of this question have already been tackled by different communities within chemical and materials sciences, such as drug discovery, inorganic solid state, metal-organic frameworks, 2D materials, etc., by exploiting various theoretical tools to construct databases of hypothetical molecules (e.g. ZINC) or materials (e.g. Materials Project). Further, computational tools, such as first-principles or classical methods, have been employed to estimate properties of these hypothetical cases, and screen promising candidates for future synthesis efforts.

      "\n",
      "In this regard, Batra et al. [44] devised an approach to explore the vast unknown chemical polymer space by generating new, but realistic, hypothetical polymers. As illustrated in Figure 2c), they first obtained SMILES representation of ~ 12,000 polymers successfully synthesized in the past. Next, using the concepts of breaking of retrosynthetically interesting chemical substructures (BRICS) [86, 87], polymer \"building blocks\" - each with two or more chain ends denoted by symbol [*], e.g., [*] c1ccc ( [*] ) cc1, [*]C(=0) [*], [*] CC [*] - were obtained along with their frequency of occurrence. Following this, hypothetical polymer SMILES strings were created by combining (at the [*] location) various numbers of building blocks, ranging from 2 - 7, resulting in a total of ~ 250,000 hypothetical polymers. This approach can be extended to create nearly infinite polymer candidates that may later be used to screen target properties. Care is taken to preserve the frequency of occurrence of different building blocks, making the constructed hypothetical SMILES dataset realistic and representative of the initial collected empirically known polymers. Moving forward, different chemical constraints or block neighbor restrictions can be introduced to limit the possible combination of building blocks, and generate more realistic/synthesizable polymers.\n",

Below, following a short discussion on the group contribution method, we discuss some of the more recent and successful polymer representation methods.\n",

      "The group contribution technique developed by Van Krevelan and coworkers assumes that a polymer property can be estimated as a weighted sum of contributions arising out of its constituting fragments (referred to as quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) fingerprints) [88]. Using this and sub- sequent variations of this method, models describing a range of polymer properties have been developed with/without machine learning, including glass transition temperature, dielectric constant, refractive index, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, gas and aqueous diffusion, and intrinsic viscosity [88-91]. How- ever, the developed models rely on the available fragment library and have little predictive capabilities for new polymers containing chemical fragments outside this pre-defined library.\n",

      "To efficiently encode chemical information of molecules into machine-readable format, line notations have been designed to describe molecules using a line of text strings. Examples of such approaches include SMILES, the Wiswesser line notation (WLN), SYBYL Line Notation (SLN) and IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChi). SMILES is one of the most popular methods to represent molecules, because it is both human-readable and machine-friendly [41]. Further, various molecular fingerprinting algorithms have been developed to transform SMILES of small molecules into numerical vectors. Avalon, Daylight and Extended-Connectivity [93] fingerprints are examples of common fingerprinting algorithms that can be accessed through the open-source RDkit library [87]. Within these fingerprints, the presence or absence of substructures within a molecule is encoded into binary vectors, which can be used as inputs to data-driven models. SMILES representations of molecules can also be utilized (or transformed as graphs) in generative neural networks for fingerprint learning and molecular generations [46, 46], but can also be directly used as input language in text-based machine learning algorithms [94, 95]. The use of SMILES and similar line notations for molecules has transformed data-driven research in chem- and bio-informatics.\n",

The ML models developed using such oligomer fingerprints can predict various properties of polymers fairly well, although the effect of polymer morphology on the target property is excluded.

Figure 3a) shows details of the hierarchical fingerprint, including the (1) atomic-level, (2) block- level, and (3) chain-level components. At the atomic-level, the number fraction of atomic-level fragments within the polymers, defined by the generic label \"A¿BjCk\", are considered. The block-level fingerprint components are the number fraction of pre-defined building blocks that constitute the polymers, such as C6H4, C=O, CH2 and CO. Chain-level features capture information at the morphological scale, including the length of the longest or shortest side chains with or without rings. Further, QSPR fingerprints, such as the volume to surfaces ratio and van der Waals surface area, are also considered. Using this approach, models to predict many properties of polymers have been developed, including band gap, glass transition temperature and dielectric constant [22, 23]. Detailed examples are provided in Section 4.\n",

Here, RepUnit1, RepUnit2, RepUnit3 are a list of (same or different) repeat units within polymers, with random positions. For example, Poly(ethylene-co-propylene) is denoted by {CC, CC(C) }, as shown in Figure 3b).

However, because monomers of many polymers are large and complicated, this leads to monomer generation failures using small substructures. Further, polymers are composed of large numbers of monomers, and it is not clear how one can incorporate large-scale morphological information as graphs. These critical issues are discussed in Section 7.\n",

      "The linear regression algorithm assumes that the property being modeled is a linear function of the fingerprints, which is the simplest method to build machine learning models. For polymers, various property prediction models have been developed using group contribution methods [88], multiple linear regression [89, 90], and least-squares regression [21, 107, 108], with QSPR or quantum-chemical fingerprints. These models are limited by the neglect of the non-linear relationships between polymer fingerprints and their properties. To overcome this issue, non-linear regression algorithms have been employed, such as support vector machine (SVM), kernel ridge regression (KRR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). For instance, Yu et al. used SVM to train glass transition prediction models using QSPR fingerprints and experimental property values [89, 109], while KRR has been applied to develop models for a series of high-throughput computed polymer properties (e.g., band gap and dielectric constant) [110].\n",

As illustrated in Figure 4a), the key advantage of GPR is that predicted uncertainties are provided by learning a generative and probabilistic distribution with the mean representing the prediction and the confidence interval estimating the uncertainty. Figure 5a) illustrates four representative GPR models, including chain band gap, glass transition temperature, frequency-dependent dielectric constant and gas permeability. These models were trained using 3881 DFT computed, and 5076, 1193 and 1779 experimental values, respectively. 5-fold cross-validation (CV) was employed to avoid model\n",

      "The GPR algorithm can be used to build accurate and reliable ML models for a single property while also providing prediction uncertainties. However, the GPR method has two issues: 1) it requires a manageable dataset size. Large datasets (> 5000) become prohibitively expensive to train. 2) It does not have the capability to train multiple properties in one single model. Therefore, more advanced algorithms have been utilized to improve these issues, such as multi-fidelity information fusion and deep learning methods as discussed below.\n",

      "It is quite common to encounter problems where several datasets have varying levels of accuracy, data generation cost and noise levels are present. Typically, the most precise experimental measurements (or computations) also tend to be the most time and resource intensive, the so-called high-fidelity (HF) data. However, polymer properties of interest can also be estimated via cheaper methods at lower accuracy. For instance, empirical trends, simple group-contribution methods and computationally demanding quantum mechanical simulations can generate this low-fidelity (LF) data. Given such a situation, a multi-fidelity (MF) information fusion model aims to consolidate all the available information from the varying fidelity sources to make the most accurate and confident property predictions at the highest level of fidelity [47, 48, 112-116]. Comparative studies have shown that the multi-fidelity approach performs better than any single-fidelity based method in terms of prediction accuracy, especially for small (high-fidelity) data sets. Typical strategies for MF learning are discussed in Ref. [47]. Among them, the Gaussian processes-based co-kriging regression method [117] is viewed as a powerful method and has been utilized to predict polymer properties, such as band gap and degree of crystallinity [48, 118]. As shown in Figure 4b), this MF approach is composed of two models: the Gaussian processes ZLF (x) of the low-fidelity function and the Gaussian processes Za(x) related to the difference between the low-fidelity and the high-fidelity functions. The property prediction at the high-fidelity level (ZHF(x)) is ZHF(x) = pZLF(x) + Za(x). Here, p is a scaling factor that quantifies the correlation between the two fidelities of data.\n",

      "Figure 5b) shows two successful examples of MF approaches being applied to polymer property pre- dictions [48, 106], i.e., the tendency to crystallize and the band gap. For the former, a MF model was trained using 107 high-fidelity data directly measured by experiments and 429 low-fidelity data estimated using a combination of experimental and group-contribution methods. In the latter, 382 hybrid and PBE computed band gap values were used as high- and low-fidelity data in the MF model. Figure 5b) compares the learning performance of the MF models against single-fidelity GPR models trained on the respective high-fidelity polymer property data, i.e., the RMSE on the training and the test set as a function of the training size of the high-fidelity data. We note that MF models surpass the GPR model accuracy (trained on the high-fidelity data alone) at a much smaller fraction of the high-fidelity training data. This is mainly because the relatively large volume of the low-fidelity data, although somewhat inaccurate, allows the MF model to learn polymer property trends. These findings indicate that there are benefits to employing the MF approach, especially in situations wherein resource demanding high-fidelity experimental data can be combined with a large number of low-fidelity and inexpensive computational data.\n",

      "While the first proof-of-principle examples are just beginning to appear, MF models could have a consid- erable impact in the field of polymer informatics. It is worth pointing out that the accuracy of MF models depends on the ability of the shared subset of high- and low-fidelity data to learn the latent space of the two fidelities. Further, there is a necessity to improve upon the MF scheme. For instance, several levels\n",

      "of fidelity hierarchies can be present simultaneously in the polymer property datasets. The number of the co-kriging model parameters can significantly increase in such scenarios, leading to expensive computational cost. Consequently, advanced MF learning algorithms should be developed to speed up the learning process, particularly when several levels of fidelities are present in the polymer data sets.\n",

      "Conventional machine learning techniques described above provide good property prediction accuracy. However, these methods are computationally efficient for systems with small dataset size only. Given the surge in the available computational/experimental data in materials science, deep neural networks (NN) are being increasingly utilized in polymer informatics. Figure 4c) presents the general architecture of NNs, in which molecular or polymer fingerprints form the input layer. The following hidden layers are constructed with a specific activation function, e.g., the parametrized rectified linear unit (PReLU). The final output layer of the NN consists of neuron(s) for target properties, also with a specific activation function depending on the problem at hand (classification or regression). The details of various types of NNs and their uses in materials science are well-reviewed in Refs. [119-121]. Below we discuss the initial attempts to apply NNs for polymer properties prediction [43, 49, 122-125].\n",
      "\n",
      "The selection of suitable polymer-solvent pairs is a critical step for polymer synthesis. Chandrasekaran et al. have developed a deep neural network model for solvent prediction [49]. In this work, 4,595 polymers and 24 solvents, forming a total of 11,958 polymer + good-solvent pairs and 8,469 polymer + non-solvent pairs, were used to train a binary classification NN model (i.e., given a polymer-solvent pair the model predicts if it a good-solvent or non-solvent for that polymer). A multilayer perceptron with special architecture was used: the first part of the NN composed of two input branches, one for the polymer descriptors generated using hierarchical fragment-based fingerprint described in Section 3 and the other for the solvent descriptors represented by one-hot encoding. In the second part, polymer and solvent latent space were concatenated into a single merged latent vector. Figure 5 c) shows the neural network prediction accuracy of soluble (top) and insoluble (bottom) polymers for 24 solvents, including non-polar, polar-aprotic and polar-protic solvents. Performance results for the GPR models trained using Hildebrand parameters of about 100 polymers [118] are also compared. In general, the performance of the NN model greatly outperforms that of the GPR model, mainly due to the higher level of diversity in the training data. Further, the Hildebrand parameter is only an approximate empirical approach to distinguish good-solvent against non-solvents, based on the notion of \"like dissolves like\". This deep neural network-based framework provides a more general, accurate, and efficient way to predict good-solvents vs. non-solvents for new polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, researchers have applied NNs to build prediction models for glass transition temperature [122-124], polymer permeability to gases [91] and thermal conductivity (k) of polymers [43, 85, 125]. For the glass transition temperature and polymer permeability, small datasets ( <= 150 polymers) were applied to train NNs, raising concerns on the generality of obtained models for new cases. In the case of K, Zhu et al. have used classical MD computed k values of single-chain polymers and molecular fingerprints to train the NNs models. One potential concern is that the computational uncertainty, arising from the model difference between the adopted single chain and realistic polymers, may introduce additional noise in the ML models [85]. An alternative approach is to directly use experimental « to train the model, although, only sparse data is available. To overcome this issue, Wu et al. [43] has utilized the transfer learning approach to learn the k of polymers (58 data points), via training other properties of polymers with large data size (e.g., melting temperature, glass transition temperature and heat capacities). The performance of the obtained model is better than those trained only on the thermal conductivity data, because the shared features between k and other properties and large training dataset are considered in the transfer learning algorithm. However, there are still challenges, as discussed in Section 7.\n",

However, these models are passive, with inherent errors in the property predictions owing to the limitations, such as bias or limited size of the training data. Thus, how one can dynamically and efficiently optimize polymers for the next experiment (or computation) is an important problem in materials discovery. It is far from trivial to select optimal candidates based purely on human intuition. In recent years, active-learning algorithms that exploit Bayesian optimization frameworks have been developed to effectively guide experiments or high-throughput computations for materials design, e.g., optimizing GaN LED structures, BaTiO3 based piezoelectrics, and other inorganic materials for thermoelectric and electronic devices [127].\n",

      "As illustrated in Figure 7b), active learning algorithms consist of three important components: 1) a surrogate model for the target property prediction; 2) an acquisition function to select the optimal point for the next experiment; 3) addition of the newly performed experiment to the knowledge dataset [126, 127]. The surrogate models in part 1) can be trained using various algorithms introduced in Section 4. To provide both prediction and uncertainty values of the target property, Gaussian process-based algorithms are common approaches used in active learning. There are other methods, such as support vector regression or decision trees in combination with bootstrapping methods, that estimate both the target property and its uncertainty. In part 2), the user can search unlabeled data by either using the prediction uncertainties (called exploration), or by maximizing the target prediction values (called exploitation), or by balancing between exploration and exploitation. In the last part, the newly generated data from the new experiment is supplemented into the knowledge dataset to retrain the surrogate model. The whole pipeline is repeated until the target candidate is achieved.\n",

Figure 7b) illustrates the average number of experiments required to discover 1 - 10 polymers with a glass transition temperature of above 450 K, starting from an initial training dataset of 5 polymers. The error bars denote the standard deviation across the 50 different runs. We note that on average 30, 46, 98 and 234 experiments were required to discover 10 high-glass transition temperature polymers using acquisition function definitions based on balanced exploitation and exploration, exploitation, exploration and random approaches, respectively. These findings indicate that the balanced exploitation and exploration method showed the best performance in terms of discovering promising polymer candidates. Additionally, Huan et al. have applied the active learning to automatically select polymer candidates for high-throughput DFT computations and find polymer dielectrics with a large band gap. More details are shown in Section 5. It is evident that the integration of active-learning within the materials discovery pipeline can guide materials design and dataset expansion in an efficient and targeted fashion.\n",

      "GA is based on the principle of natural selection. The inherent structure of a polymer makes its treatment using GA straightforward-a polymer can be thought of as a sequence of chemical building blocks (e.g. CH2, C6H6, or blocks B12, B13 in Figure 8a) connected to each other by covalent bonds (analogous to DNA base pairs), and the properties of a polymer are functions of the sequence of constituent chemical building blocks (analogous to how oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2) gene sequence mostly dictates human eye color). Within the GA approach a series of crossover, mutation and selection operations are applied to discover new candidate polymers with desired properties. It starts with a random generation of (say, 100) polymers, whose chemical building blocks are modified using crossover-pruning and mixing of monomer building blocks-and mutation-random alterations to monomer building blocks-operations to obtain a large set of offspring polymers, as illustrated in Figure 8a). Next, the top offspring candidates with desired properties are selected based on their user-defined objective score to form the next generation of polymers. This GA cycle is repeated until a sufficient number of candidates with desired properties are obtained, as in Figure 8b). Besides polymer discovery, GA has also been utilized to solve other problems in materials science, such as developing functional forms of interatomic potentials [133], and discovering hidden material property\n",

      "\n",
      "## relations [134].\n",
      "\n",
      "A critical component of the GA design scheme is the evaluation of the objective function during the selection stage. This step has been a major bottleneck for polymer discovery since property estimation through experiments or computations is very expensive and time-consuming [135]. However, with the recent development of cheap and reliable polymer property models (Section 5.1), the objective function can now be computed in a fraction of a second. This allows the GA process to truly explore a very rich chemical polymer space, going well-beyond the pre-defined candidate sets. Furthermore, by setting-up a property weighted objective function, polymers that simultaneously satisfy multiple property criteria can be targeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim and co-workers used GA to design polymers with high glass transition temperature and large band gap, which are useful for high-energy capacitors because of their stability at both high temperatures and electric fields [128]. Notably, this is a difficult design problem, with only 4 out of thousands of known polymers displaying glass transition temperature > 500 K and band gap > 6 eV. Two interesting aspects of their design process was the choice of the chemical building blocks, and the underlying property prediction models. The former consisted of a comprehensive list of 3,045 chemical blocks, extracted from ~ 12,000 synthetically known polymers using the concept of BRICS-similar to the hypothetical polymer design work in Section 2. Each block had 1 - 4 connection points that were used to form/break bonds with other chemical blocks during the crossover and mutation operations. For the latter glass transition temperature and band gap prediction models, they used two independent GPR surrogate models based on a hierarchical polymer fingerprinting scheme (Section 3) that were trained on an experimental and DFT computed dataset of 5,072 and 562 polymers, respectively. During 100 generations of the GA cycle, they successfully designed 132 new polymers that meet the target properties, as opposed to only 4 previously known cases (see Figure 8c)). Furthermore, their analysis of the identified polymer candidates revealed insights about the key fragments that promote high glass transition temperature and large band gap in polymers, such as the presence of terminal difluorocarbon or trifluoromethyl, saturated 5-or 6-membered rings, oxolane, etc. These findings are compatible with known chemistry. For instance, fluorine atoms induce large band gap through the formation of lower (higher) C-F sigma bonding (anti-bonding) orbitals. A similar approach has been utilized to design polymers with high dielectric constant, although it considered a relatively small number of possible chemical building blocks [51].\n",
      "\n",
      "In a different study, Pilania et al. used GA to design bio-advantaged (biosynthesizable and biodegrad- able) Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-based polymers with desired glass transition temperature values [129]. A machine learning model trained on an experimentally-measured and carefully-curated glass transition temperature values for a wide range of PHA homo- and co-polymers were combined with a GA-based search and optimization routine to explore a much wider chemical space formed by multi-component polymer chemistries, beyond co-polymers. Furthermore, by explicitly integrating the prediction uncertainties and number of polymer components in the GA objective function, they were able to focus their search on poly- mers containing desired number of components (ternary, quaternary, etc.) where the confidence level in the machine-learned glass transition temperature predictions were higher than a pre-specified cutoff value.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5.4. Generative models\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the concept of unsupervised learning, VAE and GAN offer a different route for targeting inverse polymer design. They learn a mapping from a continuous latent space to the polymer space, using which new candidates with desired properties are generated after solving the optimization problem in the more amenable latent space. For example, in the case of VAE, the encoder unit learns to represent a polymer in a high-dimensional (say, 100 - 200) continuous (latent) space, while the decoder unit learns to map back a vector in the latent space to a valid polymer, as shown in Figure 8d). Both mappings are important from a materials design perspective: the encoder provides a fingerprinting scheme that can be exploited by different \"forward models\", while the decoder provides a pathway to systematically search polymers in a proxy latent space using different optimization schemes, and later generate the desired polymer candidate associated with the optimal latent point. Although the VAE and GAN approaches have received attention for molecule or drug discovery [136-140], they are only beginning to be exploited for extended systems such as polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "17\n",
      "\n",
      "A key challenge in developing such a generative model is that the decoder unit should map a continuous latent space to a discrete and structured material space, which should represent a valid candidate material as dictated by chemistry. For example, in case of polymers, the decoder output should necessarily have two chain ends, or the involved C and O atoms should display a valency of 4 and 2, respectively. This goal of enforcing the decoder to output valid polymers was recently achieved by Batra et al. [44] using syntax- directed VAE. The strategy involves representing the polymers using their SMILES representation, and then imposing the decoder to obey both the syntactic and semantic constraints associated with the class of polymers; syntactic refers to the grammatical rules inherent to the SMILES language, while semantic refers to the contextual constraints driven by polymer chemistry. The inclusion of explicit syntax and semantics in the VAE model improves the quality of the learned latent space. It also leads to a high occurrence of valid polymer SMILES upon decoding, making the process of discovery efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Batra et al. coupled the unsupervised syntax-directed VAE with the supervised GPR method to discover polymers with high glass transition temperature and large band gap [44]. They used the encoder unit to fingerprint the polymers, which were then mapped to the respective glass transition temperature and band gap values using GPR. To train the VAE model they had to overcome a crucial data sparsity challenge: to-date the total number of chemically diverse polymers synthesized is ~ 12,000, while a VAE model usually requires > 100,000 points for its training. They used retro-synthetic ideas to generate a representative hypothetical dataset of ~ 250,000 polymers, constructed from the previously discussed set of 3,045 chemical building blocks. For the discovery of polymers with target properties, they first encode a few known polymers that satisfy the given design criteria to find regions in the latent space where desirable polymers are expected to be present. Linear interpolations within these preferred regions of the latent space are then used to select latent points for which GPR property predictions meet the desired goals. Finally, the decoder is used to obtain the polymer SMILES associated with such selected latent vectors. Several hundreds of new polymers that meet the target property objectives were generated using this process. We anticipate that the concepts of transfer learning, multi-task learning and semi-supervised learning will advance the use of generative models for polymer discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following comparisons between the GA and the generative techniques for inverse design can be made. First, GA is relatively easy to interpret and entails little efforts to tune the involved parameters (mutation chance, initial population, etc.). In contrast, VAE models being based on NNs are almost impossible to interpret and often entail hefty parameter tuning efforts. Second, the space explored by GA is somewhat constrained by the polymer building blocks, but the SMILES based polymer representation allows VAE to explore a much wider chemical space in a truly unconstrained manner. Lastly, prior knowledge can be easily incorporated in GA, for instance, by biasing the initial population and/or the mutation operation towards favorable building blocks. However, more comparative studies would be needed in the future to establish methods that are appropriate under different scenarios.\n",

Given the increasing needs of high energy density capacitors, the development of polymer informatics can significantly facilitate the discovery of novel polymer dielectrics [25, 29, 98, 99, 143]. Typically, good polymer dielectrics for high energy density capacitors need to satisfy several property requirements, e.g., high dielectric constant and high breakdown strength (which is positively correlated with band gap and charge injection barriers of metal/polymer interfaces [146]). Further, polymers with high glass transition temperature are desired for high-temperature capacitors to enhance the thermal stability at extreme temperature [144, 145]. Thus,\n",

Additionally, many representative polymer dielectrics are being proposed for high- temperature capacitors by either screening known/hypothetical polymers using the enumeration method [52, 146] or using the generative models, such as GA [128] and VAE [44], as described in Section 5.\n",

A typical class of polymers called polymers of intrinsic microporosity, has attracted great attention since the early 1990s [147]. The present polymer membranes suffer from low selectivity and physical aging, calling for the exploration of novel polymeric membranes. However, it is non-trivial to find promising polymer membranes with a combination of high permeability and selectivity (or above the upper bound of \"Robeson plots\" [149]) for different gas pairs, e.g., O2/N2. Some initial attempts have been performed to speed up the polymer membrane search using data-driven approaches, for instance, building gas permeability prediction models [111] (see Section 4) and identifying polymer membrane candidates for CO2/CH4 separation using the enumeration method [42].\n",

Motivated by their commercial need, the development of novel and safer solid polymer electrolyte materials has caught ever-increasing attention [10, 150-152]. To optimize the performance of Li-ion batteries, the polymer electrolytes should have a wide electrochemical stability window, high ionic conductivity and Li-ion transference, and low glass transition temperature. Since it is time-consuming to search optimal electrolytes using experiments, data-driven aided polymer design strategies provide a great opportunity. For example, we previously noted that Wang et al. designed novel polymer electrolytes with high ionic conductivity using machine learning aided coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations [37]. Additionally, the property prediction models (Section 4) and the design algorithms (Section 5) discussed above are powerful methods to screen/design polymer electrolytes satisfying multiple property requirements.\n",

      "Although polymers are usually insulators, there is a class of intrinsically conducting polymers used in electronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors and organic solar cells [6, 153, 154]. Molecular doping is often used to further increase the conductivity of polymers [153], but it slows down the discovery of optimal polymer-dopant pairs with high conductivity because of the complex nature of the electron transfer mechanisms, dopants and polymers interactions, and processing conditions. This situation can be improved using polymer informatics, e.g. developing conductivity prediction models and screening optimal polymer-dopants pairs using the enumeration method. It is supported by the discovery of several high-performing donor/acceptor pairs for organic solar cells using random forest and boosted regression trees based property prediction models [53].\n",

      "## 6.5. Biodegradable and depolymerizable polymers discovery\n",
      "\n",
      "Bioplastics, such as those derived from plants and bacteria, are rich in highly oxygenated molecules. They can be utilized in the production of monomers capable of facile conversion to plastic materials that are easily degradable in the environment [155]. However, to fully harness the power of these nonconventional biosynthesis routes, it needs to establish structure-property relationships to identify desired application- specific optimal chemistries. To understand this problem better, Pilania et al. have proposed a machine learning route to learn structure-property mappings in PHA-based polymers from polymer data [129]. More- over, it is critical to discover new biodegradable polymer candidates with high biodegradability. Because low crystallinity, melting temperature and glass transition temperature lead to large amorphous regions and favor biodegradation, ration-design of biodegradable polymers satisfying these properties using data-driven methods can be an important research topic. For instance, some new biodegradable polymers with desired glass transition temperature have been designed recently using GA [129] (see Section 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, depolymerizable polymers are playing an increasingly important role in practical applica- tions, especially in drug delivery, recyclable plastics, self-healing and recyclable coating materials [156, 157]. Such great interest is motivated by the fact that depolymerizable polymers, upon exposure to particular stimuli, can be triggered to rapidly depolymerize into monomers at moderate to relatively low tempera- tures. As a result, polymers with low ceiling temperatures are desirable, where ceiling temperature is the temperature at which the polymerization and depolymerization rates are in equilibrium. Because of the limited available number of known polymers with low ceiling temperatures, it is greatly desired to propose computational strategies to estimate the ceiling temperature. Further, the data-driven design tools involved in polymer informatics could be applied to rapidly screen such depolymerizable polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7.1. Beyond homopolymers\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, many data-driven approaches have been limited to homopolymers. The space of co-polymers, polymer blends and polymers with additives/nanocomposites remains largely unexplored but has great prac- tical significance. Brinson and co-workers have spent significant efforts to develop \"NanoMine\" for polymer nanocomposites analysis and design [158]. However, it is still non-trivial to treat these types of polymers, because of their complicated chemical and physical structures. Co-polymers consist of two/more monomer or basic building unit types, and could be branched or linear co-polymers (further classified as block, al- ternating and random co-polymers based on the structural arrangement of different monomers). Polymer blends are mixtures of two or more polymers, including homogeneous, immiscible and heterogeneous polymer blends. The ratios and structural arrangements of different monomers (or polymers) significantly impact properties of co-polymers and polymer blends, but only sparse data is available on this topic. Moreover, it is challenging to systematically and dynamically collect such data from various resources. Thus, advanced techniques need to be developed to collect, represent and learn data of more complex varieties of polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7.2. Sustainable data capture\n",
      "\n",
      "The core requirement for polymer informatics is a broad-based data acquisition and management in- frastructure. In addition to the limited number of available polymer databases and polymer handbooks, a large amount of scientific data remains untapped in numerous scientific journals, including text, tables or figures. While the manual text excerption of such journals is very time consuming and laborious, machine learning-based NLP methods are more powerful and promising tools to expedite and automate this process. The application of NLP tools in material science is still in its infancy. More efforts are needed to incorporate materials or polymers domain knowledge into existing NLP algorithms (e.g., word2vec [159]) to train word- vectors (numerical vectors that represent distinct words) for scientific information retrieval. To achieve this goal, Named Entities Recognition (NER) is the most important step, i.e., tokenizing the words into scientific meanings (e.g., chemical species, synthesis conditions and characterization methods). ChemDataExtractor [160], ChemSpot [161] and ChemTagger [162] are available toolkits for extracting chemical information of\n",
      "\n",
      "20\n",
      "\n",
      "materials from scientific articles, such as inorganics and molecules. Similar tools need to be developed for the polymer domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, polymers pose additional challenges [21, 26], as there is no standard or complete polymer name entity dictionaries. A collection of source-based, structure-based, traditional and abbreviation names are interchangeably used to name polymers [26]. For example, polyethylene is also called PE, poly(ethylene) and poly-(ethylene), but all these possible names should be treated as the same entity (in a process referred to as \"normalization\" by the NLP community). In addition to names, more efforts are required to assign polymer notations for specific categories, e.g., properties, synthesis recipes and characterization technologies. Therefore, it is of great importance to create unique and standard polymer related dictionaries in the future. Other important issues include building efficient toolkits to interpret monomer SMILES from polymer names, identifying structure (or polymer names)-property relationships in texts, and extracting valuable material property contained in images and tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7.3. Polymer representation and learning\n",
      "\n",
      "As discussed in Section 3, molecular or polymer-based fingerprints can provide acceptable prediction ac- curacy for many polymer properties, e.g., glass transition temperature, band gap, dielectric constant and gas permeability. This is because the chemical structure of the monomers plays a dominant role in determining these properties. However, other important polymer properties, including crystallinity, mechanical proper- ties (e.g., tensile strength) and solution behavior, strongly depend on their molecular weights, morphologies (linear or cross-link) and processing conditions (temperature, pressure and cooling-rates). Incorporating these descriptors in the fingerprint framework is critical to the creation of accurate, robust and universal property prediction models.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to enriching the polymer fingerprint definition, more advanced neural networks algorithms can be applied for learning the latent knowledge, property prediction and polymer generations. For instance, the transfer-learning or multi-task learning approaches have great potential to deal with the sparse data issue in polymers. The former modifies the latent features learned using one source task to learn a different target task, while the latter trains multiple source tasks and the shared features used to learn a target task. The key concept common between these two methods is the learning of a shared (polymer) representation between related properties (or materials). These algorithms have been successfully applied in the domain of drug design and bioinformatics [163-165]. In polymers, as mentioned in Section 4, Yamada et al. have used the transfer-learning method to predict properties of polymers using pre-trained models of molecules and inorganic materials [125]. However, large and diverse datasets of related property (tasks) are essential for the success of such models, as only then there is a high chance of learning transferable features and achieving accurate predictions for the target task.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important topic is the use of graph neural networks (GNN) in polymer informatics. In contrast to traditional manually designed fragment-based ML models, GNN represents materials as graphs (typically, atoms as nodes and their bonds as edges) and automatically find their optimal fingerprint representation depending on the downstream learning task, leading to its wide applications for molecules. However, the use of GNN for polymers has been limited [104, 124] owing to the difficulty in treating large-scale polymers using graphs. Further, polymers are made up of numerous repeat units, and the best way to treat connection points between repeat units in a graph is unclear. Using oligomers to replace polymers is a potential solution [104, 124], however, its prediction capability needs to be tested. Additionally, ideas on graph generative methods for molecules, e.g., atoms- and substructure-based encoder-decoder methods [45] could be extended for polymers using GNN. Another interesting approach of graph-to-graph translation was recently put forth to optimize molecules with desired properties, by assembling one molecular graph with another of the target properties [46]. All of these techniques can be adapted for polymers, provided the following challenges are addressed. Many polymers have large-sized monomers (> 50 atoms), making it difficult to correctly assemble potential fragments during the decoding process. Motifs-based methods can greatly increase the reconstruction and validation accuracy for polymer generation by using large-size motifs as building blocks [45]. However, other concerns remain, such as chemical or thermodynamic stability of generated polymers and their synthetic feasibility.\n",

      "\n",
      "Even with the knowledge of which polymer to make for a given application (designed, for instance, using intuition, computation or machine learning), the realization of the polymer can still be very slow because of synthesis challenges. There are various uncertain factors, such as unavailability, toxicity or high cost of the raw materials or demanding technical steps. In the past, the synthesis pathways adopted for a target polymer have been heavily dependent on the domain knowledge and personal preferences of experimenters. Computer-assisted retro-synthesis techniques have been widely developed in the last several decades to identify a series of reaction pathways leading to the synthesis of a target product. In the domain of molecules, either template-based [54, 166] or template-free [105, 167, 168] machine learning approaches have been built for product prediction and have achieved promising results. However, no such method has been developed yet for the case of polymers. Complications in the polymer synthesis processes, e.g., various polymerization mechanisms (such as addition, ring-opening and condensation polymerization), the selection of optimal monomers and solvent pairs, processing conditions (such as cooling rates or annealing temperatures) will need to be considered. Further, unlike molecules, there is no library of reaction templates for polymerization. Nevertheless, experimental polymer synthesis data is plentiful, which can be accumulated manually or using NLP methods, and processed appropriately to develop machine learning models for polymer synthesis and retro-synthesis planning.\n",

      "## 7.5. Autonomous integration of experimental and computational workflows\n",
      "\n",
      "As all the different pieces of AI-assisted chemical search, retro-synthesis planning and processing op- timization come together, the idea of autonomous polymer synthesis and design is expected to become a reality. In fact, examples of autonomous robot researchers with the ability to synthesize drugs for tropi- cal diseases [169], carbon nanotubes with targeted growth rates [170], layered superlattices [171], and even perform x-ray scattering measurements [172], have already been demonstrated recently. However, polymers owing to their structural, chemical and processing complexity pose unique challenges for autonomous de- sign. For instance, the average molecular weight of a polymer, which predominantly dictates its properties, is highly sensitive to the processing time and conditions. Learning such complex relations, from the data alone, will be challenging for an autonomous researcher. The real-time/in-line characterization of polymers is also difficult owing to their complex semi-crystalline/amorphous structure, or due to the different degree of branching or stereochemical relationships. Nonetheless, the prowess of autonomous labs in terms of time and cost benefits, experimentation consistency, long hours of operation, and efficient and robust search of parameter spaces is expected to guide polymer discovery in the future.\n",

      "One significant barrier in polymer informatics is accurately representing the complex structures of polymers for machine learning applications. Conventional monomer-based representations have limitations because they do not account for the periodic nature of polymers and can result in non-unique and incorrect representations. In the paper by Evan R. Antoniuk, Peggy Li, Bhavya Kailkhura, and Anna M. Hiszpanski, the researchers address this challenge by introducing a new polymer graph representation that captures the periodicity of polymers. This representation is used in conjunction with a message-passing neural network (MPNN) to automatically learn chemically-relevant descriptors from data.\n",

      "Their methodology led to an average reduction of 20% in the prediction error for a broad spectrum of polymer properties when compared to previous approaches. This demonstrates the benefit of directly encoding chemical intuition, specifically the periodic nature of polymers, into polymer graph representations for improving the accuracy of predictions in polymer informatics. The authors also show that MPNN-learned features outperform traditional hand-crafted features, highlighting the potential of using advanced machine learning techniques for predicting polymer properties and aiding the design of new polymers.\n",

These challenges permeate the continuum of career stages for researchers, requiring a unified and multidisciplinary approach to overcome them.\n",

      "Technically, polymer researchers are tasked with accurately representing polymers' intricate, hierarchical structures. This representation is foundational for computational modeling and further material development. Stephen Wu et al. underscore the issues inherent to this task, such as the absence of a unified structural representation and the scant availability of open-access databases crucial for advancing the field in \"Potentials and challenges of polymer informatics\" [1]. On the other hand, advancements like the periodic polymer graph representation introduced by Evan R. Antoniuk et al. have achieved a significant reduction in prediction errors by an average of 20%, demonstrating the effectiveness of specialized chemical descriptors for polymers in \"Representing Polymers as Periodic Graphs with Learned Descriptors for Accurate Polymer Property Predictions\" [2].\n",

      "In the realm of ethical considerations, while not explicitly outlined in the aforementioned papers, it is generally recognized within the broader field that polymer research has profound implications for environmental sustainability. Researchers bear the responsibility to develop polymers that align with principles of sustainability, mindful of the materials' lifecycle, and potential ecological impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ethical stewardship in polymer informatics is echoed by Ishan Kumar and Prateek K. Jha in \"Coarse-Grained Configurational Polymer Fingerprints for Property Prediction using Machine Learning,\" which elucidates the potential of machine learning models to predict a polymer's behavior and equilibrium state with implications for ecological and health considerations [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, researchers are encouraged to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Acknowledge the significance of unified databases and contribute to their expansion, facilitating advancements in polymer informatics [1].\n",
      "2. Engage with emerging machine learning tools, such as those that employ message-passing neural network frameworks, to enhance the reliability of polymer property predictions [2].\n",

      "|Keywords: machine learning polymer bead-spring model coarse-grained probability at equilibrium|In this work, we present a method to generate a configurational level fingerprint for polymers using the Bead-Spring-Model. Unlike some of the previous fingerprint- ing approaches that employ monomer-level information where atomistic descriptors are computed using quantum chemistry calculations, this approach incorporates con- figurational information from a coarse-grained model of a long polymer chain. The proposed approach may be advantageous for the study of behavior resulting from large molecular weights. To create this fingerprint, we make use of two kinds of descrip- tors. First, we calculate certain geometric descriptors like Re2, Rg2 etc. and label them as Calculated Descriptors. Second, we generate a set of data-driven descriptors using an unsupervised autoencoder model and call them Learnt Descriptors. Using a combination of both of them, we are able to learn mappings from the structure to var- ious properties of the polymer chain by training ML models. We test our fingerprint to predict the probability of occurrence of a configuration at equilibrium, which is ap- proximated by a simple linear relationship between the instantaneous internal energy and equilibrium average internal energy.|\n",

      "Polymers have a broad range of applications in chemical, biomedical, and material sciences.[1-6] De- spite having a whole range of interesting physical properties that can be fine tuned by variations in the poly- mer molecular weight, composition, and functionalization, the actual design of polymeric systems is quite challenging due to their vast design space. Prevailing approaches of the design of polymeric systems are mostly experimental and experience-driven, and there is a tremendous scope for theoretically/computationally derived design rules that can accelerate the polymer design process. With the development of computational methods and Machine Learning (ML) in recent years, there has been a growth in the number of material databases and hence computational design has also become a feasible and reliable option. Recent works in ML on polymers show that it can serve as a promising tool in both property prediction and molecular design.[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to develop ML model for polymers, they need to be represented as a vector, which is known as their molecular fingerprint. The most common type of fingerprint is a series of binary digits that represent the presence or absence of particular substructures in the molecule.[7-9] A polymer structure is composed of many simpler chemical units, called monomers or repeat units, which are bonded together to form a long chain macromolecule. Most existing methods use the repeat unit's fingerprint as the fingerprint of the polymer or a weighted-average of repeat units in case of a heteropolymer. This results in a total vec- tor that is invariant to the arrangement of monomer components. Although this strategy is acceptable for short oligomers, it fails for longer polymers where the effects of the arrangement of monomers and polymer\n",

While some properties of polymers like the density or glass transition temperature depends mostly on chemical details at monomer scale, others (e.g., variation of melt viscosity with molecular weight[10]) are predominantly controlled by the configurational statistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, ML has been extensively used in the design of polymers for a range of desired applica- tions. In doing so, one often has to calculate a certain Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) value for the polymer and it should be within an appropriate range so that the polymer can be suitably used for that specific application. For instance, in ref. [2], authors propose an ML-assisted molecular design and efficiency prediction for high-performance organic photo-voltaic materials. They use predicted filler factor (FF), short circuit current density (Jsc), and the open circuit voltage (Voc) as the desired QSAR target proper- ties. As another example, a promising mechanism to enhance the efficient phosphorescent OLED materials is thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which may be studied if the delayed fluorescent rate constant KTADF is selected as the desired property.[4] The general approach that is followed in these studies is that first the structure of the polymer is represented using a Simplified Molecular-Input Line Entry System (SMILES) form. This SMILES string is subsequently converted to a fixed length vector like MACCS (166 bits), Pubchem (876 Bits), FP2 (1020 Bits), Extended Hybridization (1021 Bits), Daylight (1024 Bits), or Morgan (2048 Bits).[2] The training dataset consisting of the polymers and their ground truth labels for the desired QSAR properties is either used from existing databases or created using first-principle calculations. This dataset is used to learn a mapping between structure and property using a regression model like Kernel Ridge Regression or a Neural Network. Upon learning the structure-property relation, we can accept or reject a given polymer based on its predicted value. Further, if the task involves generation of new materi- als, inverse design of polymers with the required target properties through genetic algorithm or other search algorithms can be performed. The fingerprint plays a vary important role in both these steps and hence improvement in the same would result in better predictive and generative capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most promising fingerprinting approach of polymers is that adopted in \"Polymer Genome\" [11] in which a custom fingerprint is created using a hierarchical approach combining three levels of de- scriptors. The first level of descriptors are atomic level descriptors in which the occurrence of a fixed set of atomic fragments (or motifs) are tracked. The next level used is Quantitative Structure-Property Rela- tionships (QSPR) Descriptors, like molecular quantum numbers, fraction of sp3 carbons, molecular Surface area, van der Waals surface, fraction of aromatic rings, etc. The final level consists of morphological de- scriptors, like the shortest topological distance between rings, fraction of atoms that are part of side-chains, and the length of the largest side-chain. Properties such as the glass transition temperature strongly depend on such features, which influence the way the chains are packed in the polymer. Polymer Genome shows good results across many QSAR tasks like bandgap, dielectric constant, atomisation energy, glass transition temperature etc. For instance, in ref. [12], authors predict the glass transition temperature of a polymer using 5 different models created through cross validation. The R2 varies from 0.713 to 0.759. In ref. [13] also, authors predict the glass transition of amorphous polymers using MD simulations. They obtain a R2 value of 0.84 using cross validation by using a set of 7 descriptors. These results are less promising than the ones in Polymer Genome[11], where an R2 of 0.944 has been reported. The improvement in results can be partially attributed to the fact Polymer Genome also employs a few configurational level descriptors in the top hierarchy (like length of side chain, distance between chains etc.). In contrast, the entire configuration- level information is missed in the other works as their fingerprint is only atomistic (based on QSAR values of the monomers). Further, we see from Polymer Genome that a combined fingerprint works better across tasks and not just on a specific task, and we believe this will also be the case for long chain polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we aim to introduce configuration-level information in the fingerprint and test its predic- tive capability through ML tasks. Since atomistic simulations of long polymer chains are computationally intensive, we employ coarse-grained (CG) Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to develop an ML model.

A decrease in CG resolution results in reduced com- putational cost of the CG model but lesser information about the original atomistic model is preserved. One may therefore perform CG simulations at an appropriate CG resolution to capture the physical properties of interest. Here, we use a simple bead-spring model[14], in which the polymer chain is composed of N beads (j = 0, 1, ... , N - 1) connected by N - 1 massless, harmonic springs (j = 1,2, ... , N - 1). Each bead may represent a single repeat unit or a sub-chain containing multiple repeat units. Chain is considered ideal, i.e., non-bonded interactions between the beads are not considered.

In order to obtain these feature vectors, we pass the (N,3) position vectors through an encoder model (part of an autoencoder) which outputs a k- dimensional feature vector [15]. While it is not possible to fully understand what these features represent (like in the case of calculated descriptors), they are useful patterns that the model has learnt and will help in the final prediction. Further, we do cross-validation to find out the number of such features needed.\n",

      "Once we have both kinds of descriptors, we can concatenate them and pass them through the ML model to predict the \"probability of occurrence\". In order to train this model, we also require training data which consists of the fingerprints (input data) and their ground truth probability of occurrence (labels). Since the ground truth probability of occurrence is not known, we cannot directly save it from the simulation run. To this end, we come up with a novel approach of approximating the probability of occurrence of a configuration at equilibrium. We make use of Internal Energy (U) as a surrogate for calculating ground truth labels. Figure 1 shows the typical profile of U against the number of steps of MC simulation. Umax is the maximum value of U and Uequilibrium is the \"equilibrium\" value defined as the equilibrium-average of U.\n",

      "9 MC simulations consists of large number of MC steps involving trial displacements of a randomly chosen bead with maximum step size AR in a random direction. The displacements are made by picking a random bead and attempting a displacement on an imaginary sphere of fixed radius 8R≤ AR around the current position. The maximum step size AR is a tunable parameter. It should neither be too small nor too large. If the AR is too small, it results in many moves being accepted, but the system advances slowly in configuration space. Many displacements are thus needed to achieve equilibration. On the other hand, if the AR is too large, many moves will be rejected and the equilibration process is again slow. We keep the step size as dynamic, i.e. it is increased when the acceptance percentage crosses a threshold, likewise decreases if it goes below a threshold. A running average of the acceptance percentage was kept for intervals of 400, 000 steps and we found that keeping the threshold as 68% worked well. MC simulation are conducted for 108 MC steps. In order to ensure that the data points are decorrelated with each other the sampling is done with a frequency of 106, i.e., states are saved after every 106 steps.\n",

      "The conventional Metropolis MC algorithm has an inherent bias towards generating high equilibrium probability configurations. The issue with this is, we will a strong imbalance in the dataset since we have hardly any configurations with low probability. This results in the prediction model not being able to learn that part of the dataset well. Thus, in order to generate low probability samples we make use of random sampling. We make a copy of our polymer state and apply random moves with a larger step size. If the final internal energy is less than a fixed Umax then we accept it and save it as part of the dataset.\n",

Along with these, we also store the position vectors of all beads at that time step, which is used to learn more useful descriptors using an unsupervised autoencoder model. Combining both of these (calculated and learnt) descriptors, we create a fingerprint and use it for the task of measuring probability of occurrence at equilibrium. The ground truth values of these probabilities is calculated using a linear relationship involving the internal energies of the run and we use a fully connected neural network to predict these probabilities given the fingerprint.\n",

Subsequently, we tested using only the learnt descriptors, and not using the calculated descriptors. The input becomes 32 dimensional in this case. As it can be seen from third column of Table 1, the values of metrics in this case are also lesser than the model using both descriptors. Hence we can conclude that calculated descriptors also add value to the model. From these tests, we find that the R2 shows a value of > 0.9 in both calculated and learnt descriptor case. Therefore, if one is not interested in using the learnt descriptors in order to keep the model more explainable, then also a R2 ~ 0.92 can be attained using the calculated descriptors alone. Further, we also verify the fact that both learnt and calculated descriptors provide useful information as removing either reduces the values of all metrics. The high R2 value of 0.9949 for the model using both descriptors validates the idea that the configurational fingerprint adds value to the predictive capabilities of the model.\n",

Anomalously high value at X~75000 occurs because the position vector takes very large values in this case. It is a singular exceptional case when the MC simulation ends up taking very large steps, and therefore, due to lack of similar data, the model is unable to correctly predict it.\n",

      "9 From this work, we are able to show that a configurational fingerprint can be beneficial in predicting properties of a polymer using a generalised model of the polymer. We show that it performs well on the task of predicting the probability of occurrence at equilibrium. Further, we believe other tasks like QSAR/QSPR where existing methods only use atomic level information of the repeat unit, will also benefit from adding configurational fingerprint along. We also devise a method for creating ground truth labels of probability of occurrence at equilibrium, which can be used to train other models for predicting the same. Having an ML model predict probability of occurrence for given states also has large number of applications like find- ing ensemble averages of configuration dependent properties, calculating high probability/low probability configurations etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several extensions of this study may be thought of. First, We only experimented using the basic bead spring model of linear polymers (did not consider branching), but the approach can easily be extended for branched polymers. Second, instead of only considering bonded interactions, we may also include non bonded interactions like Lennard Jones and Coulomb interactions, which may be required for modeling more realistic polymers. Third, the fully connected neural network can be replaced with a convolutional neural network so that it is spatially invariant.\n",

      "This paper introduces a machine learning (ML) approach for predicting the properties of polymer chains by using a fingerprint generated from the configurational information of a coarse-grained (CG) model. Instead of focusing on the monomer-level information of polymers for fingerprints, which is typically obtained from quantum chemistry calculations, the authors propose a fingerprint that captures large-scale molecular weights and configurations of long polymer chains. They generate both calculated descriptors (geometric indices of the polymer configuration) and learned descriptors (compressed features via autoencoder model) to represent the polymers.\n",

      "The authors use a simple bead-spring model for polymers in their CG model and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to explore the configurational space of polymer chains. They adopt a novel approach to approximate the probability of occurrence of polymer configurations at equilibrium by using internal energy as a proxy. These probabilities are then used as ground truth labels to train their ML models.\n",

      "This paper introduces a machine learning (ML) approach for predicting the properties of polymer chains by using a fingerprint generated from the configurational information of a coarse-grained (CG) model. Instead of focusing on the monomer-level information of polymers for fingerprints, which is typically obtained from quantum chemistry calculations, the authors propose a fingerprint that captures large-scale molecular weights and configurations of long polymer chains. They generate both calculated descriptors (geometric indices of the polymer configuration) and learned descriptors (compressed features via autoencoder model) to represent the polymers.\n",

      "The authors use a simple bead-spring model for polymers in their CG model and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to explore the configurational space of polymer chains. They adopt a novel approach to approximate the probability of occurrence of polymer configurations at equilibrium by using internal energy as a proxy. These probabilities are then used as ground truth labels to train their ML models.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials. Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, as well as how to automatically develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Specifically, our pipeline for polymer property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations with a sizable 20% average reduction in prediction error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding periodicity into our polymer graph representation is responsible for a considerable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while achieving better predictive performance than human-derived features. Whereas previous polymer informatics have typically utilized hand-designed descriptors that have been optimized for representing molecules, this work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The complex chemical structure of polymers provides chemists with an unprecedented level of chemical design opportunities. As a result, efforts focused on the rational design of polymers has led to their use in a remarkably wide range of applications.1,2 By varying a polymer's monomer structure, its propagation site, or the polymer chain length, the properties of the polymer can be tuned to suit the application of interest.3 6 Formulations of polymers with chemical additives adds an even richer potential design and functional space. However, efficiently navigating this vast chemical design space to identify promising polymer materials for a given application is incredibly challenging. Recently, the field of polymer informatics has shown much promise in tackling this challenge by utilizing machine learning (ML) models to learn the complex structure-property relationships of polymers.7,8 Through the development of increasingly accurate ML models, one can envision the future possibility of fully computational polymer design workflows whereby polymers can be rapidly designed in silico to satisfy multiple property criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate machine learning models require that the input to the model - be it an image, text, or chemical structure - is transformed into a machine-readable format that captures and represents all relevant features of the input. The development of suitable polymer representations to use as inputs for machine learning algorithms has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in the field of polymer informatics.9,10 Unlike molecules that consist of a fixed number of atoms and typically only contain dozens of atoms, a given polymer can consist of a periodic chain of between 100-106 repeating chemical sub-units.11\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents a considerable challenge for creating machine-readable polymer representations since they must encode the periodic nature of the polymer structure and also be compact enough to represent up to millions of atoms. Despite these challenges, previous work on small molecules and crystalline solids has demonstrated that developing physically-inspired representations of atomistic systems is a fruitful direction towards realizing significant improvements in property prediction accuracy.12-15\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we develop a new polymer representation that is the first to explicitly capture the periodic nature of polymeric materials. First, we show that the widely used monomer-based representations cannot sufficiently describe the periodic, extended structure of polymers and can result in unreliable property predictions. To solve this issue, we have developed a novel polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph and that naturally incorporates polymers' periodicity in its construction. Across a diverse spectrum of 10 unique polymer properties, we find that our polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous monomer-based representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction error. Finally, we demonstrate how our polymer graph representations can be combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework to automatically extract chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from a dataset of polymer properties. We find that these MPNN-learned polymer features yield more accurate property predictions than predetermined features that have been hand-crafted by chemists over years.\n",

      "Recently, a wide range of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately predict polymer properties in an a priori manner.16,17 These previous approaches typically represent polymers by their monomer repeat unit which is then converted into either i) molecular descriptors that includes the presence of molecular fragments and/or property descriptors (such as the molecular weight of the molecule)18-20 or ii) a molecular graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds are represented as edges (Figure 1a)).17 It should be noted that these representations were first developed for molecules before being transferred to the field of polymer informatics. Although these monomer-based representations perform well at representing finite molecules, we show in this work that monomer-based representations cannot adequately represent the extended chain structures that define polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using monomer-based representations as inputs for ML algorithms results in at least three notable issues: i) the generation of non-unique representations for polymers that are composed of the similar monomer repeat units (see \"monomer graphs\" of Polymer A and B in Figure 1 c), ii) incorrect bonding environment of the polymer, and iii) a lack of periodicity. Polymers A and B in Figure 1c) are two distinct polymers with notably different chemical structures and properties. Since the monomer of a polymer is defined as the smallest repeat unit of the polymer chain, the monomer of the two polymers in Figure 1 c) is therefore the same C-C-O subunit (or CH3 CH2OH if including hydrogen atoms). Regardless of the specific details of the featurization used, generating a representation of Polymer A and B based only on their monomers will result in two identical representations (see Supplementary Note 1). In turn, an ML algorithm that then uses these representations to learn a structure-property relationship will, at best, only be able to learn the average value of the property across the polymers, which may lead to large prediction errors. The second issue that will arise from the use of monomer-based representations is the incorrect featurization of the polymer. Polymer B consists of a repeating (-C-C-O-) backbone, which is characterized by an ether functional group (R-O-R, where R is any alkane). However, the monomer of Polymer B ( C-C-O) does not contain an ether functional group since this ether group is artificially fragmented when forming the monomer representation. This is particularly problematic since both fingerprinting approaches and property descriptors utilize the presence of functional groups and connectivity in their representations (Supplementary Note 1).21-23 Thirdly, the failure to include periodicity in these monomer-based representations results in representations that are inconsistent due to trivial translations along the polymer backbone. The polymer (-C-C-O-)n can also be written as (-C-O-C-)n by translating all atoms one position along the polymer chain. However, the monomer representations for these two equivalent polymer representations would be C-C-O and C-O-C, respectively. As shown in this example, the failure to explicitly account for periodicity in these monomer-based representations can result in inconsistent featurizations, which can negatively impact the ability of ML algorithms to learn the underlying structure-property relationships. These inconsistent featurizations are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamentally, all three of the aforementioned problems arise due to a failure to account for the periodic nature of polymers. In other words, a finite molecule (i.e. a monomer) cannot be used to represent a continuous, extended chain of atoms without fragmenting chemical bonds in an unphysical manner. We note that featurizing Polymers A and B by generating dimers (or any larger oligomer chain) instead of monomers results in unique representations. Using a dimer representation, however, still results in incorrect featurizations due to the incomplete bonding environment of the atoms at the terminal end of the dimer.\n",

Polymer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to exploit existing polymer data for efficient design of functional polymers. Despite many potential benefits of employing a data-driven approach to polymer de- sign, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics\n",

We hope that this paper can serve as an entry point for researchers interested in the field of polymer informatics.\n",

      "Polymers are one of the most important classes of material in modern society, as its applica- tions range from the plastic bags and bottles used in daily life to a variety of electronics, and even structural components in the aerospace industry. A polymer is a material made of a col- lection of chains that are built by connecting many repeated units, called monomers. These chains can form diverse structures that contribute to the highly diverse physical and chemi- cal properties of different types of polymers. Some polymers can be consisting of more than one type of monomer to form even more complicated topological structures across different length scales. The research field of polymer science and engineering emerged to understand, control, and design novel polymers that can be used to satisfy the rapidly growing demand on highly functional materials coming from different aspects of modern life. While polymers can be categorized into natural or synthetic polymers, we will focus our discussion on the latter in this paper.\n",

      "Following the mainstream of materials science, polymer science has gone through mul- tiple major paradigm shifts. The early studies of polymers flourished in the first half of the 20th century was closely associated with H. Staudinger who received the Nobel Prize in 1953.1 Initially, discovery of polymers was mainly based on an empirical approach, i.e., relying on many trial-and-error experiments. Accumulation of experimental experiences has led to developments of theoretical and simple statistical models for guiding the design of new\n",

      "polymers. These include many important work by the 1974 Nobel prize recipient P. J. Flory, the group contribution method and so on.2-4 Following the rapid advances of computing power in the last few decades, computational methods has become one of the main tools to study properties of polymers.5 Recent developments of simulation techniques for vari- ous types of polymers opened up opportunities to computationally study polymers across different length scales. 6,7 While generating experimental data of polymers is often costly and time-consuming, modern supercomputers provide new opportunities for building larger databases of polymers computationally. With the drastic expansion of data size in science, a data-driven approach for scientific discovery is said to be the 4th paradigm of science. Poly- mer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to mine the precious polymer data for new knowledge. Yet, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics attributed to the complex hierarchical structures of polymers. 8,9\n",

      "Design of a polymer can be broken down into three parts corresponding to the three steps in the typical production process of polymers: design of monomers (polymerization), microstructures (crystallization), and material processing (manufacturing) (see Figure 1). Monomers, the building blocks of polymers, contribute to the foundation of potential prop- erties of the eventually produced polymers. While molecular size is one of the important factors that influences the properties of an organic material, the \"size effect\" of polymers is not directly correlated with the size of the monomers because a large collection of small monomers (e.g., ethylene) can also build long polymer chains the same way large monomers do. Instead, various metrics based on the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of a poly- mer are often used as a reference to relate the \"size of polymer\" to polymer properties. Different polymers built from the same monomer can have different MWD by controlling the polymerization process, which can lead to significantly different physical and chemical properties. 10-12 Furthermore, the collection of polymer chains can form very different crystal structures through a variety of crystallization processes, affecting the material properties of\n",

      "\n",
      "the resulting polymers. For example, Yi et al. controlled the crystallinity and orientation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) molecules to optimize the performance of solar cells. 13 Finally, the same type of polymer in the microscopic scale can undergo different manufacturing pro- cess, such as stretching or mixing additives, to further enhance or alter its properties in order to fulfil specific needs from a broad range of applications. 14 Ideally, the design space of polymers covers all parameters involved in the three production steps, for example, the molecule space of a single or multiple monomer(s) (namely homopolymers or copolymers, respectively), temperature and types of polymerization process, additives or fillers, molding methods, etc. In practice, we often focus on a subset of the parameters while keeping other fixed to reduce the enormous search space. For example, Wu et al. focused on the design of monomer that has a high probability of making liquid crystal polymers with high thermal conductivity after compressed to a polymer thin film. 15\n",

      "One of the most important components in machine learning is data. The quality and quantity of available data determine the scope of solvable problems in an application. A rule of thumb in machine learning is that purely data-driven models are not reliable when extrapolating. In other words, it is dangerous to trust the prediction of a model on a material that is not similar to the ones in the training data. Therefore, high quality large database for a diverse set of polymers is always of high demand in polymer informatics. Table 1 shows a list of online databases that contain polymer data. There also exists large amount of publications on polymer technology or database that collects recipes of polymer synthesis (e.g., NIST Synthetic Polymer MALDI Recipes Database23).

These issues have become the bottleneck for the development of polymer informatics.8 With the advancements of computational simulation technologies and supercomputers, we expect an increasing interest and opportunity to build large scale com- putational databases of polymers. Meanwhile, technology of high-throughput experiments 28 and the use of robotics combined with artificial intelligence29 provide new opportunities to build experimental database of polymers efficiently.

      "## Descriptor\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental purpose of a material descriptor is to uniquely encode materials in a com- pact form in order to allow for efficient machine learning. This is particularly difficult for polymers due to their hierarchical structures. 30 An example of unique representation of polymers would be the Polymer Markup Language, which is designed to include complete information of a polymer ranging from compositional information to all the processing pa- rameters.31 While this representation may be suitable for building polymer databases, it is not compact enough to be used as input of a model for machine learning purposes. In fact, a good material descriptor should consider the tradeoff between ability to uniquely represent a material, easiness to obtain or calculate, and sensitivity to targeted application. 32 In other words, while possible, it is unlikely that a single descriptor can be used for all polymer ap- plications. For example, to search for an efficient polyimide for controlled inkjet deposition, descriptor needs to be sensitive to specific microstructures formed by the polymer chains. 33 On the other hand, designing polymers with certain phase transition properties will require a descriptor that identifies key atomic-level structures. Different level of \"fineness\" of de- scriptor should be selected depending on the physical and chemical properties of interest to the target problem. 34 One example that attempted to capture such hierarchy of descriptor in a Python package is the Materials knowledge systems. 35 Here, we introduce and compare a few descriptors that could be useful in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing conditions of polymers, such as temperature, additives and solvents, can be directly included in a descriptor. Representations of the microstructure and molecular struc- ture of polymer chains are less intuitive. Certain machine learning models in deep learning allow direct use of images as input, but often require a significant amount of data to train the models. 36 Persistant homology is a technique to extract statistical features from topo- logical structures, 37 but its application in polymer informatics is yet to be investigated. Graphical kernel is another option to numerically encode the polymer structures that can be represented in a simple graph. 38 However, finding an efficient graph representation for\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "\n",
      "the complex polymer structures is challenging, especially because different types of polymer chains can form structures in different length scales. Many of the descriptors commonly used in polymer informatics focus on capturing the molecular structure of monomers composing the polymer chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Material descriptors or fingerprints developed for small organic molecules are directly applicable to represent polymers based on their monomers. Modern machine learning al- gorithms also allow direct use of molecular graph or simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) 39 strings as input of a model. 40 Picking a descriptor suitable for the prob- lem of interest may significantly improves the efficiency of machine learning. 34 However, such representation omits information about the chemical bonds between the monomers. An al- ternative is to consider oligmer consisting of n monomers, but there is no clear answer to how to pick n. The larger n is, the more representative the oligmer would be to the polymer. Nevertheless, certain types of descriptors, such as the physical descriptors, will take signifi- cantly longer time to calculate for a larger molecule. Furthermore, some fingerprints could be biased toward polymers with smaller or larger monomers depending on the choice of n. For example, a fingerprint that counts if there are more than 3 benzene rings in a molecule will not be able to distinguish between polystyrene and poly(bisphenol A carbonate) when n > 3. Figure 3 shows how different fingerprints may have different convergence behavior with respect to n. Wu et al. proposed to calculate descriptor of polymers using an infinitely long chain of their corresponding monomers. 19 However, the bias issue for some fingerprints remains unsolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymer chain can be separated into a backbone and its side chains. Distinguishing the two components is theoretically important to predict polymer properties. However, it is not clear how to efficiently encode such information into a general descriptor for different classes of polymers. Similarly, developing descriptors for polymers consisting of more than one type of monomer is still an open challenge. For alternating copolymer, we can simply consider the combined repeating unit of multiple monomers as a \"metamonomer\", but the molecule\n",

      "One of the key components in polymer design is the prediction of polymer properties relevant to a target application. Some of the important properties often considered in the polymer industry include transparency, glass transition temperature, toughness, etc.41 The ability to predict properties of different classes of polymers opens up new computational design approaches for polymers, such as high-throughput screening and inverse design, which will be discussed in the next section. One approach to predict polymer properties is building empirical equations based on physical descriptors and some basic properties of polymers.\n",

      "\n",
      "An effort to collect such equations in Python has been made by the thermo package. 42 This approach can be very powerful, but could be difficult to use when predicting properties for a new design with not much knowledge available yet. Another approach that is more suitable for design purpose, called the quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) modeling, aims at mapping structural descriptors of a material to its property. In particular, models that rely only on 2D structure information of the polymer is preferred as it avoids intensive geometry optimization for the polymer molecules. To date, around 300 articles can be found on the web of science database when searching with keywords QSPR and polymer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Group contribution method is one of the earliest data-driven approaches to predict com- plex properties of different polymers.3 The basic idea is that certain groups of bonded atoms within different molecules may have common effects on a specific material property. Linear regression is used to model the interaction between groups when data is limited, but higher order models can also be used. Machine learning models using fingerprints as input can be seen as an extension to this idea, since the fingerprints are collections of rules that check the existence of different structural groups. Some commonly used models include elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, Gaussian process, neural network, etc. Table 2 summarizes some recent applications of these algorithms in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning models are inherently interpolative, i.e., their predictions are reliable only around the domain close to the training data. The range of properties prediction for certain types of polymers with a reasonable accuracy governs the potential search space one can cover, i.e., the performance of the final design. In other words, the training data determines the feasible design space of the target application. The concept of applicability domain (AD) developed in Cheminformatics is used to quantify the reliable region of a QSPR model. 49 The concept of uncertainty in statistics is also a popular metric believed to be strongly correlated with the validity of a prediction. 50 Figure 4 shows how different models fail to predict different materials properties when extrapolating from the given data.

      "One can also use a library from any open databases. Otherwise, a generative algorithm is needed to construct a pool of candidates of interest. For example, a conventional approach is to define a set of molecular fragments of interest and exhaustively combine different num- bers of fragments up to an upper limit to form the candidate set. Fragment can be obtained from organic molecules which have more large open databases, such as GDB-1756 or Pub- chem. 57 To expand beyond the search space limited by a finite variety of fragments, Wu et al. implemented a language model proposed by Ikebata et al. 59 on polymers represented in SMILES.58 Different deep neural networks are also used to learn the SMILES or graph representation of organic molecules. 60-62\n",

      "Giving a library of candidates, one can use pretrained predictive models to computation- ally screen out candidates with target properties. There is a significant amount of literature that applies high-throughput screening to different polymer applications. Recent exam- ples of high-throughput screening in polymer designs using machine learning models include searching of high refractive index polymers46,63,64 and screening optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers. 65 This strategy of polymer design may sound inefficient to solve a single design problem, because a significantly large library is needed to increase the probability of finding candidates of interest. However, a well-developed library that contains diverse candi- dates can be reused for many different design problems. With a rich database of candidates, high-throughput screening is a very attractive tool in many industrial applications.\n",

      "## Inverse design\n",
      "\n",
      "Another design strategy, referred as the inverse design, is to perform targeted search in a materials space guided by knowledge extracted from existing data. While predictive model is a mapping from an input x (polymer) to an output y (material property), the goal of inverse design is to map a targeted range of y to a sub-domain of x. This can be achieved by solving an optimization problem using sophisticated algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, or by sampling the set of x with high probability to be in the targeted range of y under a\n",

      "2. Propose a new set of candidates based on the existing ones.\n",

      "3. Evaluate likeliness of the candidates to have the desired material properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for fixed number of times or until convergence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In step 2, a generative algorithm is needed to propose new candidates similar to the one in the high-throughput screening. In the case of optimization, the likeliness metric in step 3 is usually a loss function measuring the distance of the predicted properties for the candidates and the targeted properties. For sampling, the likeliness metric is usually correlated with the probability of observing the candidates conditional on the targeted properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inverse design problem is inherently ill-posed, i.e., there are different types of mate- rials that may have the target properties. It is important that an inverse design algorithm can produce a diverse set of candidates in order to maximize the probability of discovering novel functional materials. Typical optimization algorithm can only search for the optimal solution. Sampling methods can have a higher chance to provide diverse candidates, but can also be trapped in a local mode, especial when the search space is high dimensional. Many efforts have been made to address this issue, such as limiting the search space size, projecting the search space to a low dimensional space, or employing an annealing algorithm, etc. Table 3 shows some recent examples of successful inverse design of different polymer applications using machine learning technologies.\n",

There are two perspectives to the optimality of candidate selection: (1) exploit the knowledge embedded in the existing data to make the best guess of which candidates may satisfy the design goal, or (2) explore candidates with the least information from the existing data to infer their properties. In a typical experimental design algorithm, we define a utility function that balance the tradeoff between the two perspectives.

      "approach of polymer design will significantly improve the pace of making new functional polymers, satisfying the rapidly expanding demand on polymeric materials in modern society (e.g., deformable electronic devices74). One of the most important elements of polymer informatics is the availability of large open databases. Building such databases for polymer is challenging because of many reasons: (1) difficulty of encoding the hierarchical structure of polymers for machine learning purposes, (2) inconsistent naming rules throughout the history of polymer science, (3) lack of data sharing due to many privately own industrial data, etc. Nonetheless, this is an essential step towards a fully data-driven design process. Many efforts have been made to build the backbone technologies necessary to exploit the potential benefit of polymer informatics, such as developing new descriptors to better capture the physical properties of polymers and new simulation methods to estimate polymer properties with higher accuracy in a shorter time. The true power of polymer informatics is to release polymer scientists from the low efficiency trial-and-error design process, thus, to free up more time for higher level design concepts and theoretical advancements. Such opportunity can be realized only if we work together to push for a more open community in polymer science, where everyone can benefit from the new paradigm of polymer design. An easy first step to take would be to engage in the field of polymer informatics and experience the new way of studying polymers ourselves.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials. Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, as well as how to automatically develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Specifically, our pipeline for polymer property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations with a sizable 20% average reduction in prediction error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding periodicity into our polymer graph representation is responsible for a considerable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while achieving better predictive performance than human-derived features. Whereas previous polymer informatics have typically utilized hand-designed descriptors that have been optimized for representing molecules, this work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The complex chemical structure of polymers provides chemists with an unprecedented level of chemical design opportunities. As a result, efforts focused on the rational design of polymers has led to their use in a remarkably wide range of applications.1,2 By varying a polymer's monomer structure, its propagation site, or the polymer chain length, the properties of the polymer can be tuned to suit the application of interest.3 6 Formulations of polymers with chemical additives adds an even richer potential design and functional space. However, efficiently navigating this vast chemical design space to identify promising polymer materials for a given application is incredibly challenging. Recently, the field of polymer informatics has shown much promise in tackling this challenge by utilizing machine learning (ML) models to learn the complex structure-property relationships of polymers.7,8 Through the development of increasingly accurate ML models, one can envision the future possibility of fully computational polymer design workflows whereby polymers can be rapidly designed in silico to satisfy multiple property criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate machine learning models require that the input to the model - be it an image, text, or chemical structure - is transformed into a machine-readable format that captures and represents all relevant features of the input. The development of suitable polymer representations to use as inputs for machine learning algorithms has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in the field of polymer informatics.9,10 Unlike molecules that consist of a fixed number of atoms and typically only contain dozens of atoms, a given polymer can consist of a periodic chain of between 100-106 repeating chemical sub-units.11\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents a considerable challenge for creating machine-readable polymer representations since they must encode the periodic nature of the polymer structure and also be compact enough to represent up to millions of atoms. Despite these challenges, previous work on small molecules and crystalline solids has demonstrated that developing physically-inspired representations of atomistic systems is a fruitful direction towards realizing significant improvements in property prediction accuracy.12-15\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we develop a new polymer representation that is the first to explicitly capture the periodic nature of polymeric materials. First, we show that the widely used monomer-based representations cannot sufficiently describe the periodic, extended structure of polymers and can result in unreliable property predictions. To solve this issue, we have developed a novel polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph and that naturally incorporates polymers' periodicity in its construction. Across a diverse spectrum of 10 unique polymer properties, we find that our polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous monomer-based representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction error. Finally, we demonstrate how our polymer graph representations can be combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework to automatically extract chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from a dataset of polymer properties. We find that these MPNN-learned polymer features yield more accurate property predictions than predetermined features that have been hand-crafted by chemists over years.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, a wide range of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately predict polymer properties in an a priori manner.16,17 These previous approaches typically represent polymers by their monomer repeat unit which is then converted into either i) molecular descriptors that includes the presence of molecular fragments and/or property descriptors (such as the molecular weight of the molecule)18-20 or ii) a molecular graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds are represented as edges (Figure 1a)).17 It should be noted that these representations were first developed for molecules before being transferred to the field of polymer informatics. Although these monomer-based representations perform well at representing finite molecules, we show in this work that monomer-based representations cannot adequately represent the extended chain structures that define polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using monomer-based representations as inputs for ML algorithms results in at least three notable issues: i) the generation of non-unique representations for polymers that are composed of the similar monomer repeat units (see \"monomer graphs\" of Polymer A and B in Figure 1 c), ii) incorrect bonding environment of the polymer, and iii) a lack of periodicity. Polymers A and B in Figure 1c) are two distinct polymers with notably different chemical structures and properties. Since the monomer of a polymer is defined as the smallest repeat unit of the polymer chain, the monomer of the two polymers in Figure 1 c) is therefore the same C-C-O subunit (or CH3 CH2OH if including hydrogen atoms). Regardless of the specific details of the featurization used, generating a representation of Polymer A and B based only on their monomers will result in two identical representations (see Supplementary Note 1). In turn, an ML algorithm that then uses these representations to learn a structure-property relationship will, at best, only be able to learn the average value of the property across the polymers, which may lead to large prediction errors. The second issue that will arise from the use of monomer-based representations is the incorrect featurization of the polymer. Polymer B consists of a repeating (-C-C-O-) backbone, which is characterized by an ether functional group (R-O-R, where R is any alkane). However, the monomer of Polymer B ( C-C-O) does not contain an ether functional group since this ether group is artificially fragmented when forming the monomer representation. This is particularly problematic since both fingerprinting approaches and property descriptors utilize the presence of functional groups and connectivity in their representations (Supplementary Note 1).21-23 Thirdly, the failure to include periodicity in these monomer-based representations results in representations that are inconsistent due to trivial translations along the polymer backbone. The polymer (-C-C-O-)n can also be written as (-C-O-C-)n by translating all atoms one position along the polymer chain. However, the monomer representations for these two equivalent polymer representations would be C-C-O and C-O-C, respectively. As shown in this example, the failure to explicitly account for periodicity in these monomer-based representations can result in inconsistent featurizations, which can negatively impact the ability of ML algorithms to learn the underlying structure-property relationships. These inconsistent featurizations are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamentally, all three of the aforementioned problems arise due to a failure to account for the periodic nature of polymers. In other words, a finite molecule (i.e. a monomer) cannot be used to represent a continuous, extended chain of atoms without fragmenting chemical bonds in an unphysical manner. We note that featurizing Polymers A and B by generating dimers (or any larger oligomer chain) instead of monomers results in unique representations. Using a dimer representation, however, still results in incorrect featurizations due to the incomplete bonding environment of the atoms at the terminal end of the dimer.\n",

Polymer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to exploit existing polymer data for efficient design of functional polymers. Despite many potential benefits of employing a data-driven approach to polymer de- sign, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics\n",

We hope that this paper can serve as an entry point for researchers interested in the field of polymer informatics.\n",

      "Polymers are one of the most important classes of material in modern society, as its applica- tions range from the plastic bags and bottles used in daily life to a variety of electronics, and even structural components in the aerospace industry. A polymer is a material made of a col- lection of chains that are built by connecting many repeated units, called monomers. These chains can form diverse structures that contribute to the highly diverse physical and chemi- cal properties of different types of polymers. Some polymers can be consisting of more than one type of monomer to form even more complicated topological structures across different length scales. The research field of polymer science and engineering emerged to understand, control, and design novel polymers that can be used to satisfy the rapidly growing demand on highly functional materials coming from different aspects of modern life. While polymers can be categorized into natural or synthetic polymers, we will focus our discussion on the latter in this paper.\n",

      "Following the mainstream of materials science, polymer science has gone through mul- tiple major paradigm shifts. The early studies of polymers flourished in the first half of the 20th century was closely associated with H. Staudinger who received the Nobel Prize in 1953.1 Initially, discovery of polymers was mainly based on an empirical approach, i.e., relying on many trial-and-error experiments. Accumulation of experimental experiences has led to developments of theoretical and simple statistical models for guiding the design of new\n",

      "polymers. These include many important work by the 1974 Nobel prize recipient P. J. Flory, the group contribution method and so on.2-4 Following the rapid advances of computing power in the last few decades, computational methods has become one of the main tools to study properties of polymers.5 Recent developments of simulation techniques for vari- ous types of polymers opened up opportunities to computationally study polymers across different length scales. 6,7 While generating experimental data of polymers is often costly and time-consuming, modern supercomputers provide new opportunities for building larger databases of polymers computationally. With the drastic expansion of data size in science, a data-driven approach for scientific discovery is said to be the 4th paradigm of science. Poly- mer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to mine the precious polymer data for new knowledge. Yet, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics attributed to the complex hierarchical structures of polymers. 8,9\n",

      "Design of a polymer can be broken down into three parts corresponding to the three steps in the typical production process of polymers: design of monomers (polymerization), microstructures (crystallization), and material processing (manufacturing) (see Figure 1). Monomers, the building blocks of polymers, contribute to the foundation of potential prop- erties of the eventually produced polymers. While molecular size is one of the important factors that influences the properties of an organic material, the \"size effect\" of polymers is not directly correlated with the size of the monomers because a large collection of small monomers (e.g., ethylene) can also build long polymer chains the same way large monomers do. Instead, various metrics based on the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of a poly- mer are often used as a reference to relate the \"size of polymer\" to polymer properties. Different polymers built from the same monomer can have different MWD by controlling the polymerization process, which can lead to significantly different physical and chemical properties. 10-12 Furthermore, the collection of polymer chains can form very different crystal structures through a variety of crystallization processes, affecting the material properties of\n",

      "\n",
      "the resulting polymers. For example, Yi et al. controlled the crystallinity and orientation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) molecules to optimize the performance of solar cells. 13 Finally, the same type of polymer in the microscopic scale can undergo different manufacturing pro- cess, such as stretching or mixing additives, to further enhance or alter its properties in order to fulfil specific needs from a broad range of applications. 14 Ideally, the design space of polymers covers all parameters involved in the three production steps, for example, the molecule space of a single or multiple monomer(s) (namely homopolymers or copolymers, respectively), temperature and types of polymerization process, additives or fillers, molding methods, etc. In practice, we often focus on a subset of the parameters while keeping other fixed to reduce the enormous search space. For example, Wu et al. focused on the design of monomer that has a high probability of making liquid crystal polymers with high thermal conductivity after compressed to a polymer thin film. 15\n",

In order to achieve a fully data-driven process of polymer design, continuous efforts have been made to bridge the demand of machine learning technologies and the current state of polymer informatics. In this paper, we review and discuss the applications of machine learning on different aspects of the polymer design process through four perspectives: polymer databases, representation (descriptor) of polymers, predictive models for polymer properties, and polymer design strategy.

      "One of the most important components in machine learning is data. The quality and quantity of available data determine the scope of solvable problems in an application. A rule of thumb in machine learning is that purely data-driven models are not reliable when extrapolating. In other words, it is dangerous to trust the prediction of a model on a material that is not similar to the ones in the training data. Therefore, high quality large database for a diverse set of polymers is always of high demand in polymer informatics. Table 1 shows a list of online databases that contain polymer data. There also exists large amount of publications on polymer technology or database that collects recipes of polymer synthesis (e.g., NIST Synthetic Polymer MALDI Recipes Database23). These types of information require extra processing effort before being useful for polymer informatics.\n",

      "Comparing to other research fields (e.g., image recognition) that benefit from modern ma- chine learning technology, deep learning specifically, the number and size of open databases in polymer informatics are significantly smaller. We have accumulated a large amount of polymer data throughout the history of polymer science, but many historical data recorded in handbooks or publications are not well-organized, and a lot of the industry-owned data are not openly available. These issues have become the bottleneck for the development of polymer informatics.8 With the advancements of computational simulation technologies and supercomputers, we expect an increasing interest and opportunity to build large scale com- putational databases of polymers. Meanwhile, technology of high-throughput experiments 28 and the use of robotics combined with artificial intelligence29 provide new opportunities to build experimental database of polymers efficiently. Making these databases open for research purposes will be the key to the success of polymer informatics.\n",

      "## Descriptor\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental purpose of a material descriptor is to uniquely encode materials in a com- pact form in order to allow for efficient machine learning. This is particularly difficult for polymers due to their hierarchical structures. 30 An example of unique representation of polymers would be the Polymer Markup Language, which is designed to include complete information of a polymer ranging from compositional information to all the processing pa- rameters.31 While this representation may be suitable for building polymer databases, it is not compact enough to be used as input of a model for machine learning purposes. In fact, a good material descriptor should consider the tradeoff between ability to uniquely represent a material, easiness to obtain or calculate, and sensitivity to targeted application. 32 In other words, while possible, it is unlikely that a single descriptor can be used for all polymer ap- plications. For example, to search for an efficient polyimide for controlled inkjet deposition, descriptor needs to be sensitive to specific microstructures formed by the polymer chains. 33 On the other hand, designing polymers with certain phase transition properties will require a descriptor that identifies key atomic-level structures. Different level of \"fineness\" of de- scriptor should be selected depending on the physical and chemical properties of interest to the target problem. 34 One example that attempted to capture such hierarchy of descriptor in a Python package is the Materials knowledge systems. 35 Here, we introduce and compare a few descriptors that could be useful in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing conditions of polymers, such as temperature, additives and solvents, can be directly included in a descriptor. Representations of the microstructure and molecular struc- ture of polymer chains are less intuitive. Certain machine learning models in deep learning allow direct use of images as input, but often require a significant amount of data to train the models. 36 Persistant homology is a technique to extract statistical features from topo- logical structures, 37 but its application in polymer informatics is yet to be investigated. Graphical kernel is another option to numerically encode the polymer structures that can be represented in a simple graph. 38 However, finding an efficient graph representation for\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "\n",
      "the complex polymer structures is challenging, especially because different types of polymer chains can form structures in different length scales. Many of the descriptors commonly used in polymer informatics focus on capturing the molecular structure of monomers composing the polymer chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Material descriptors or fingerprints developed for small organic molecules are directly applicable to represent polymers based on their monomers. Modern machine learning al- gorithms also allow direct use of molecular graph or simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) 39 strings as input of a model. 40 Picking a descriptor suitable for the prob- lem of interest may significantly improves the efficiency of machine learning. 34 However, such representation omits information about the chemical bonds between the monomers. An al- ternative is to consider oligmer consisting of n monomers, but there is no clear answer to how to pick n. The larger n is, the more representative the oligmer would be to the polymer. Nevertheless, certain types of descriptors, such as the physical descriptors, will take signifi- cantly longer time to calculate for a larger molecule. Furthermore, some fingerprints could be biased toward polymers with smaller or larger monomers depending on the choice of n. For example, a fingerprint that counts if there are more than 3 benzene rings in a molecule will not be able to distinguish between polystyrene and poly(bisphenol A carbonate) when n > 3. Figure 3 shows how different fingerprints may have different convergence behavior with respect to n. Wu et al. proposed to calculate descriptor of polymers using an infinitely long chain of their corresponding monomers. 19 However, the bias issue for some fingerprints remains unsolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymer chain can be separated into a backbone and its side chains. Distinguishing the two components is theoretically important to predict polymer properties. However, it is not clear how to efficiently encode such information into a general descriptor for different classes of polymers. Similarly, developing descriptors for polymers consisting of more than one type of monomer is still an open challenge. For alternating copolymer, we can simply consider the combined repeating unit of multiple monomers as a \"metamonomer\", but the molecule\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the key components in polymer design is the prediction of polymer properties relevant to a target application. Some of the important properties often considered in the polymer industry include transparency, glass transition temperature, toughness, etc.41 The ability to predict properties of different classes of polymers opens up new computational design approaches for polymers, such as high-throughput screening and inverse design, which will be discussed in the next section. One approach to predict polymer properties is building empirical equations based on physical descriptors and some basic properties of polymers.\n",

      "\n",
      "An effort to collect such equations in Python has been made by the thermo package. 42 This approach can be very powerful, but could be difficult to use when predicting properties for a new design with not much knowledge available yet. Another approach that is more suitable for design purpose, called the quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) modeling, aims at mapping structural descriptors of a material to its property. In particular, models that rely only on 2D structure information of the polymer is preferred as it avoids intensive geometry optimization for the polymer molecules. To date, around 300 articles can be found on the web of science database when searching with keywords QSPR and polymer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Group contribution method is one of the earliest data-driven approaches to predict com- plex properties of different polymers.3 The basic idea is that certain groups of bonded atoms within different molecules may have common effects on a specific material property. Linear regression is used to model the interaction between groups when data is limited, but higher order models can also be used. Machine learning models using fingerprints as input can be seen as an extension to this idea, since the fingerprints are collections of rules that check the existence of different structural groups. Some commonly used models include elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, Gaussian process, neural network, etc. Table 2 summarizes some recent applications of these algorithms in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning models are inherently interpolative, i.e., their predictions are reliable only around the domain close to the training data. The range of properties prediction for certain types of polymers with a reasonable accuracy governs the potential search space one can cover, i.e., the performance of the final design. In other words, the training data determines the feasible design space of the target application. The concept of applicability domain (AD) developed in Cheminformatics is used to quantify the reliable region of a QSPR model. 49 The concept of uncertainty in statistics is also a popular metric believed to be strongly correlated with the validity of a prediction. 50 Figure 4 shows how different models fail to predict different materials properties when extrapolating from the given data.

For sampling, the likeliness metric is usually correlated with the probability of observing the candidates conditional on the targeted properties.\n",

      "The inverse design problem is inherently ill-posed, i.e., there are different types of mate- rials that may have the target properties. It is important that an inverse design algorithm can produce a diverse set of candidates in order to maximize the probability of discovering novel functional materials. Typical optimization algorithm can only search for the optimal solution. Sampling methods can have a higher chance to provide diverse candidates, but can also be trapped in a local mode, especial when the search space is high dimensional. Many efforts have been made to address this issue, such as limiting the search space size, projecting the search space to a low dimensional space, or employing an annealing algorithm, etc. Table 3 shows some recent examples of successful inverse design of different polymer applications using machine learning technologies.\n",

      "The goal of experimental design is to minimize the amount of new experiments required to reach a design goal. There are two perspectives to the optimality of candidate selection: (1) exploit the knowledge embedded in the existing data to make the best guess of which candidates may satisfy the design goal, or (2) explore candidates with the least information from the existing data to infer their properties. In a typical experimental design algorithm, we define a utility function that balance the tradeoff between the two perspectives. Candi- dates that optimize the utility function are selected for the next round of tests. Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning are two commonly used algorithms for experimental\n",

However, polymer experiments are costly and syntheses of new polymers are difficult. Computational simulations are becoming more and more accessi- ble, yet calculations for new polymers often required labor-intensive tuning of model param- eters. Automatic simulation, synthetic planning, and property measurement for polymers remain challenging and are continuously explored by researchers in polymer informatics.\n",

      "approach of polymer design will significantly improve the pace of making new functional polymers, satisfying the rapidly expanding demand on polymeric materials in modern society (e.g., deformable electronic devices74). One of the most important elements of polymer informatics is the availability of large open databases. Building such databases for polymer is challenging because of many reasons: (1) difficulty of encoding the hierarchical structure of polymers for machine learning purposes, (2) inconsistent naming rules throughout the history of polymer science, (3) lack of data sharing due to many privately own industrial data, etc. Nonetheless, this is an essential step towards a fully data-driven design process. Many efforts have been made to build the backbone technologies necessary to exploit the potential benefit of polymer informatics, such as developing new descriptors to better capture the physical properties of polymers and new simulation methods to estimate polymer properties with higher accuracy in a shorter time. The true power of polymer informatics is to release polymer scientists from the low efficiency trial-and-error design process, thus, to free up more time for higher level design concepts and theoretical advancements. Such opportunity can be realized only if we work together to push for a more open community in polymer science, where everyone can benefit from the new paradigm of polymer design. An easy first step to take would be to engage in the field of polymer informatics and experience the new way of studying polymers ourselves.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials. Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, as well as how to automatically develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Specifically, our pipeline for polymer property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous hand-designed representations with a sizable 20% average reduction in prediction error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding periodicity into our polymer graph representation is responsible for a considerable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while achieving better predictive performance than human-derived features. Whereas previous polymer informatics have typically utilized hand-designed descriptors that have been optimized for representing molecules, this work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.\n",

      "The complex chemical structure of polymers provides chemists with an unprecedented level of chemical design opportunities. As a result, efforts focused on the rational design of polymers has led to their use in a remarkably wide range of applications.1,2 By varying a polymer's monomer structure, its propagation site, or the polymer chain length, the properties of the polymer can be tuned to suit the application of interest.3 6 Formulations of polymers with chemical additives adds an even richer potential design and functional space. However, efficiently navigating this vast chemical design space to identify promising polymer materials for a given application is incredibly challenging. Recently, the field of polymer informatics has shown much promise in tackling this challenge by utilizing machine learning (ML) models to learn the complex structure-property relationships of polymers.7,8 Through the development of increasingly accurate ML models, one can envision the future possibility of fully computational polymer design workflows whereby polymers can be rapidly designed in silico to satisfy multiple property criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate machine learning models require that the input to the model - be it an image, text, or chemical structure - is transformed into a machine-readable format that captures and represents all relevant features of the input. The development of suitable polymer representations to use as inputs for machine learning algorithms has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in the field of polymer informatics.9,10 Unlike molecules that consist of a fixed number of atoms and typically only contain dozens of atoms, a given polymer can consist of a periodic chain of between 100-106 repeating chemical sub-units.11\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents a considerable challenge for creating machine-readable polymer representations since they must encode the periodic nature of the polymer structure and also be compact enough to represent up to millions of atoms. Despite these challenges, previous work on small molecules and crystalline solids has demonstrated that developing physically-inspired representations of atomistic systems is a fruitful direction towards realizing significant improvements in property prediction accuracy.12-15\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we develop a new polymer representation that is the first to explicitly capture the periodic nature of polymeric materials. First, we show that the widely used monomer-based representations cannot sufficiently describe the periodic, extended structure of polymers and can result in unreliable property predictions. To solve this issue, we have developed a novel polymer representation that we refer to as a polymer graph and that naturally incorporates polymers' periodicity in its construction. Across a diverse spectrum of 10 unique polymer properties, we find that our polymer graph representation consistently outperforms previous monomer-based representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction error. Finally, we demonstrate how our polymer graph representations can be combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework to automatically extract chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from a dataset of polymer properties. We find that these MPNN-learned polymer features yield more accurate property predictions than predetermined features that have been hand-crafted by chemists over years.\n",

      "## Results\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, a wide range of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately predict polymer properties in an a priori manner.16,17 These previous approaches typically represent polymers by their monomer repeat unit which is then converted into either i) molecular descriptors that includes the presence of molecular fragments and/or property descriptors (such as the molecular weight of the molecule)18-20 or ii) a molecular graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds are represented as edges (Figure 1a)).17 It should be noted that these representations were first developed for molecules before being transferred to the field of polymer informatics. Although these monomer-based representations perform well at representing finite molecules, we show in this work that monomer-based representations cannot adequately represent the extended chain structures that define polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using monomer-based representations as inputs for ML algorithms results in at least three notable issues: i) the generation of non-unique representations for polymers that are composed of the similar monomer repeat units (see \"monomer graphs\" of Polymer A and B in Figure 1 c), ii) incorrect bonding environment of the polymer, and iii) a lack of periodicity. Polymers A and B in Figure 1c) are two distinct polymers with notably different chemical structures and properties. Since the monomer of a polymer is defined as the smallest repeat unit of the polymer chain, the monomer of the two polymers in Figure 1 c) is therefore the same C-C-O subunit (or CH3 CH2OH if including hydrogen atoms). Regardless of the specific details of the featurization used, generating a representation of Polymer A and B based only on their monomers will result in two identical representations (see Supplementary Note 1). In turn, an ML algorithm that then uses these representations to learn a structure-property relationship will, at best, only be able to learn the average value of the property across the polymers, which may lead to large prediction errors. The second issue that will arise from the use of monomer-based representations is the incorrect featurization of the polymer. Polymer B consists of a repeating (-C-C-O-) backbone, which is characterized by an ether functional group (R-O-R, where R is any alkane). However, the monomer of Polymer B ( C-C-O) does not contain an ether functional group since this ether group is artificially fragmented when forming the monomer representation. This is particularly problematic since both fingerprinting approaches and property descriptors utilize the presence of functional groups and connectivity in their representations (Supplementary Note 1).21-23 Thirdly, the failure to include periodicity in these monomer-based representations results in representations that are inconsistent due to trivial translations along the polymer backbone. The polymer (-C-C-O-)n can also be written as (-C-O-C-)n by translating all atoms one position along the polymer chain. However, the monomer representations for these two equivalent polymer representations would be C-C-O and C-O-C, respectively. As shown in this example, the failure to explicitly account for periodicity in these monomer-based representations can result in inconsistent featurizations, which can negatively impact the ability of ML algorithms to learn the underlying structure-property relationships. These inconsistent featurizations are illustrated in Supplementary Note 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamentally, all three of the aforementioned problems arise due to a failure to account for the periodic nature of polymers. In other words, a finite molecule (i.e. a monomer) cannot be used to represent a continuous, extended chain of atoms without fragmenting chemical bonds in an unphysical manner. We note that featurizing Polymers A and B by generating dimers (or any larger oligomer chain) instead of monomers results in unique representations. Using a dimer representation, however, still results in incorrect featurizations due to the incomplete bonding environment of the atoms at the terminal end of the dimer.\n",

      "The provided text is generally factually accurate as it is well-aligned with the contents of the paper \"Representing Polymers as Periodic Graphs with Learned Descriptors for Accurate Polymer Property Predictions.\" It correctly summarizes the paper's motivation and its main contribution, which is to introduce a novel polymer representation that captures the periodicity of polymer chains, thereby enabling more accurate machine learning predictions of polymer properties. The paper does, in fact, report a 20% average reduction in prediction error across various polymer properties when using this new representation, which supports the claim made in the text. Additionally, the paper does discuss the limitations of previous monomer-based representations in capturing the periodic nature of polymers, further supporting the text's accuracy. The text captures the spirit and essential findings of the paper; however, it does not mention the specific use of the message-passing neural network (MPNN) framework, which is a critical aspect of the methodology discussed in the paper.\n",

      "This paper addresses a substantial challenge in polymer informatics: accurately representing the complex, multi-scale structures of polymeric materials for machine learning applications. Traditionally used monomer-based representations fall short in capturing the periodic, extended nature of polymers, leading to inaccurate property predictions. The authors propose a novel polymer graph representation that inherently encodes the periodicity within its structure. Through the use of a message-passing neural network (MPNN), this representation helps in the automatic learning of chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from polymer property datasets. In comparison to previous hand-designed monomer-based representations, the proposed approach showed a notable 20% average reduction in prediction error across a diverse set of 10 polymer properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In exhibiting how ML models can benefit from accurate representations that incorporate the intrinsic periodicity of polymers, the paper highlights a significant step forward in predictive modeling for polymer science. The methodology can lead to a more reliable discovery of new polymers and the understanding of structure-property relationships. Additionally, the work underscores the potential advancements achieved by using chemical descriptors that are specifically tailored to the unique chemical structure of polymers, rather than adapting those optimized for small molecules.\n",

      "The accurate and efficient property prediction is essential to the design of polymers in various applications, including polymer electrolytes, 1,2 organic optoelectronics, 3,4 energy storage, 5,6 and many others.7,8 Rational representations which map polymers to continuous vector space are crucial to applying machine learning tools in polymer property prediction. Fingerprints (FPs), which have been proven to be effective in molecular machine learning models, are introduced for polymer-related tasks.9 Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have revo- lutionized polymer property prediction by directly learning expressive representations from data to generate deep fingerprints, instead of relying on manually engineered descriptors. 10 Rahman et al. used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the prediction of mechani- cal properties of polymer-carbon nanotube surfaces, 11 whereas CNNs suffered from failure to consider molecular structure and interactions between atoms. Graph neural networks (GNNs), 12 which have outperformed many other models on several molecules and polymer benchmarks, 13-17 are capable of learning representations from graphs and finding optimal fingerprints based on downstream tasks. 10 For example, Park et al. 18 trained graph convo- lutional neural networks (GCNN) for predictions of thermal and mechanical properties of polymers and discovered that the GCNN representations for polymers resulted in compara- ble model performance to the popular extended-connectivity circular fingerprint (ECFP) 19,20 representation. Recently, Aldeghi et al. adapted a graph representation of molecular en- sembles along with a GNN architecture to capture pivotal features and accomplish accu- rate predictions of electron affinity and ionization potential of conjugated polymers. 21 How- ever, GNN-based models require explicitly known structural and conformational information, which would be computationally or experimentally expensive to obtain.

      "Meanwhile, language models, like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based models, 22-25 treat polymers as character sequences for featurization. Chemistry sequences have the same structure as a natural language like English, as suggested by Cadeddu et al., in terms of the distribution of text fragments and molecular fragments.26 This elucidates the development of sequence models similar to those in computational linguistics for extracting information from chemical sequences and realizing the intuition of understanding chemical texts just like understanding natural languages. Multiple works have investigated the development of deep language models for polymer science. Simine et al. managed to predict spectra of conjugated polymers by long short-term memory (LSTM) from coarse-grained represen- tations of polymers.27 Webb et al. propose coarse-grained polymer genomes as sequences and apply LSTM to predict the properties of different polymer classes. 28 Patel et al. fur- ther extend the coarse-grained string featurization to copolymer systems and develop GNN, CNN, as well as LSTM to model encoded copolymer sequences. 29 Bhattacharya et al. lever- age RNNs with sequence embedding to predict aggregate morphology of macromolecules. 30 Plus, sequence models could represent molecules and polymers with Simplified Molecular-\n",

      "(NLP) tasks has shed light on studying chemistry and materials science by language models. Since proposed, Transformer and its variants have soon brought about significant changes in NLP tasks over the past few years. Transformer is featured with using attention mecha- nism only so that it can capture relationships between tokens in a sentence without relying on past hidden states. Many Transformer-based models like BERT, 35 RoBERTa,36 GPT,37 ELMo, 38 and XLM39 have emerged as effective pretraining methods by self-supervised learn- ing of representations from unlabeled texts, leading to performance enhancement on various downstream tasks. On this account, many works have already applied Transformer on prop- erty predictions of small organic molecules. 40-43 SMILES-BERT was proposed to pretrain the model of BERT-like architecture through a masked SMILES recovery task and then generalize into different molecular property prediction tasks. 44 Similarly, ChemBERTa, 45 a RoBERTa-like model for molecular property prediction, was also introduced, following the pretrain-finetune pipeline. ChemBERTa demonstrated competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks and scaled well with the size of pretraining datasets. Transformer-based models could even be used for processing reactions. Schwaller et al. mimicked machine translation tasks and trained Transformer on reaction sequences represented by SMILES for reaction prediction with high accuracy.46 Recently, Transformer has been further proven to be effective as a structure-agnostic model in material science tasks, for example, predicting MOF properties based on a text string representation. 47 Despite the wide investigation of Transformer for molecules and materials, such models have not yet been leveraged to learn representations of polymers. Compared with small molecules, designing Transformer-based models for polymers is more challenging because the standard SMILES encoding fails to model the polymer structure and misses fundamental factors influencing polymer properties like degree of polymerization and temperature of measurement. Moreover, the polymer se- quences used as input should contain information on not only the definition of monomers but also the arrangement of monomers in polymers. 48 In addition, sequence models for polymers are confronted with an inherent scarcity of handy, well-labeled data, considering the hard\n",

      "Herein, we propose TransPolymer, a Transformer-based language model for polymer property predictions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to introduce the Transformer-based model to polymer sciences. Polymers are represented by sequences based on SMILES of their repeating units as well as structural descriptors and then tokenized by a chemically-aware tokenizer as the input of TransPolymer, shown in Fig. 1(a). Even though there is still information which cannot be explicitly obtained from input sequences, like bond angles or overall polymer chain configuration, such information can still be learned implicitly by the model. TransPolymer consists of a RoBERTa architecture and a multi- layer perceptron (MLP) regressor head, for predictions of various polymer properties. In the pretraining phase, TransPolymer is trained through Masked Language Modeling (MLM) with approximately 5M augmented unlabeled polymers from the PI1M database. 51 In MLM, tokens in sequences are randomly masked and the objective is to recover the original tokens based on the contexts. Afterward, TransPolymer is finetuned and evaluated on ten datasets of polymers concerning various properties, covering polymer electrolyte conductivity, band gap, electron affinity, ionization energy, crystallization tendency, dielectric constant, refrac- tive index, and p-type polymer OPV power conversion efficiency. 52-55 For each entry in the datasets, the corresponding polymer sequence, containing polymer SMILES as well as useful descriptors like temperature and special tokens are tokenized as input of TransPolymer. The pretraining and finetuning processes are illustrated in Fig. 1(b) and (d). Data augmentation is also implemented for better learning of features from polymer sequences. TransPolymer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all ten benchmarks and surpasses other baseline models by large margins in most cases. Ablation studies provide further evidence of what contributes to the superior performance of TransPolymer by investigating the roles of MLM pretraining on large unlabeled data, finetuning both Transformer encoders and the regressor head, and data augmentation. The evidence from visualization of attention scores illustrates\n",

      "## 2.1 TransPolymer framework\n",
      "\n",
      "Our TransPolymer framework consists of tokenization, Transformer encoder, pretraining, and finetuning. Each polymer data is first converted to a string of tokens through tokeniza- tion. Polymer sequences are more challenging to design than molecule or protein sequences as polymers contain complex hierarchical structures and compositions. For instance, two polymers that have the same repeating units can vary in terms of the degree of polymeriza- tion. Therefore, we propose a chemical-aware polymer tokenization method as shown in Fig. 1(a). The repeating units of polymers are embedded using SMILES and additional descrip- tors (e.g., degree of polymerization, polydispersity, and chain conformation) are included to model the polymer system. Plus, copolymers are modeled by combining the SMILES of each constituting repeating unit along with the ratios and the arrangements of those re- peating units. Moreover, materials consisting of mixtures of polymers are represented by concatenating the sequences for each component as well as the descriptors for the materials. Besides, each token represents either an element, the value of a polymer descriptor, or a special separator. Therefore, the tokenization strategy is chemical-aware and thus has an edge over the tokenizer trained for natural languages which tokenizes based on single letters. More details about the design of our chemical-aware tokenization strategy could be found in the Methods section.\n",

For each benchmark, the baseline models and data splitting are adopted from the original literature. Except for PE-I which is trained on data from the year 2018 and evaluated on data from the year 2019, all other datasets are split by five-fold cross-validation. When cross- validation is used, the metrics are calculated by taking the average of those by each fold. We also train Random Forest models using Extended Connectivity Fingerprint (ECFP), 19,20 one of the state-of-the-art fingerprint approaches, to compare with TransPolymer. Besides, we develop long short-term memory (LSTM), another widely used language model, as well as unpretrained TransPolymer trained purely via supervised learning as baseline models in all the benchmarks.

The original literature used gated GNN to generate fingerprints for the prediction of polymer electrolyte conductivity by Gaussian process. 53 The fingerprints are also passed to random forest and supporting vector machine (SVM) for comparison. Another random forest is trained based on ECFP fingerprints. The results of most baseline models indicate strong overfitting which is attributed to the introduction of unconventional conductors consisting of conjugated poly- benzimidazole and ionic liquid. For instance, Gaussian Process trained on GNN fingerprints achieves a R2 of 0.90 on the training set but only 0.16 on the test set, and GNN + Ran- dom Forest gets a negative test R2 even the train R2 is 0.91. Random Forest trained on ECFP fingerprints stands out among all the baseline models, whereas its performance on test dataset is still poor. However, TransPolymerpretrained not only achieves the highest scores on the training set but also improves the performance on the test set significantly, which is illustrated by the R2 of 0.69 on the test set.

      "Table 4 summarizes the performance of TransPolymer and baselines on Egc, Egb, Eea, Ei, Xc, EPS, and Nc datasets from Kuenneth et al.54 In the original literature, both Gaus- sian process and neural networks were trained on each dataset with polymer genome (PG) fingerprints 60 as input, some of which resulted in desirable performance while some of which did not. Meanwhile, PG fingerprints are demonstrated to surpass ECFP fingerprints on the datasets used by Kuenneth et al. For Egc, Egb, and Eea, despite the high scores by other models, TransPolymer pretrained is still able to enhance the performance, lowering RMSE and enhancing R2. In contrast, baseline models perform poorly on Xc whose test R2 scores are less than 0. However, TransPolymerpretrained significantly lowers test RMSE and increases R2 to 0.50. Notably, The authors of the original paper used multi-task learning to enhance model performance and achieved higher scores than TransPolymerpretrained on some of the datasets, like Egb, EPS, and Nc (the average test RMSE and R2 are 0.43 and 0.95 for Egb, 0.39 and 0.86 for EPS, and 0.07 and 0.91 for Nc, respectively). Access to multiple prop- erties of one polymer, however, may not be available from time to time, which limits the application of multi-task learning. In addition, the TransPolymer pretrained still outperforms multi-task learning models on four out of the seven chosen datasets. Hence the improvement by TransPolymer compared with single-task baselines should still be highly valued. The scatter plots of ground truth vs. predicted values for Egc, Egb, Eea, Ei, Xc, EPS, and Nc datasets by TransPolymerpretrained are depicted in Fig. 2(c)-(i) and Supplementary Figure 2(c)-(i), respectively.\n",

Although all the model performance is not satisfying enough, possibly attributed to the noise in data, TransPolymer pretrained still outperforms baselines.

TransPolymerpretrained exhibits an average decrease of eval- uation RMSE by 7.70% (in percentage) and an increase of evaluation R2 by 0.11 (in absolute value) compared with the best baseline models, and the two values become 18.5% and 0.12, respectively, when it comes to comparison with TransPolymer unpretrained. Therefore, the pre- trained TransPolymer could hopefully be a universal pretrained model for polymer property prediction tasks and applied to other tasks by finetuning. Besides, TransPolymer equipped with MLM pretraining technique shows significant advantages over other models in dealing with complicated polymer systems. Specifically, on PE-I benchmark, TransPolymer pretrained improves R2 by 0.37 comparing with the previous best baseline model and by 0.39 comparing with TransPolymer unpretrained. PE-I contains not only polymer SMILES but also key descrip- tors of the materials like temperature and component ratios within the materials. The data\n",

Also, models are trained on data from the year 2018 and evaluated on data from the year 2019, which gives a more challenging setting. Therefore it is reasonable to infer that TransPolymer is better at learning features out of noisy data and giving a robust performance. It is noticeable that LSTM becomes the least competitive model in almost every downstream task, such evidence demonstrates the significance of attention mechanisms in understanding chemical knowledge from polymer sequences.\n",

      "preserved in the input of t-SNE. We use openTSNE library62 to create 2D embeddings via pretraining data and map downstream data to the same 2D space. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), almost every downstream data point lies in the space covered by the original ~1M pretraining data points, indicating the effectiveness of pretraining in better representation learning of TransPolymer. Data points from datasets like Xc which exhibit minor evidence of clustering in the chemical space cover a wide range of polymers, explaining the phenomenon that other models struggle on Xc while pretrained TransPolymer learns reasonable represen- tations. Meanwhile, for datasets that cluster in the chemical space, other models can obtain reasonable results whereas TransPolymer achieves better results. Additionally, it should be pointed out that the numbers of unique polymer SMILES in PE-I and PE-II are much smaller than the sizes of the datasets as many instances share the same polymer SMILES while differing in descriptors like molecular weight and temperature, hence the visualization of polymer SMILES cannot fully reflect the chemical space taken up by the polymers from these datasets.\n",

      "Besides, we have also investigated how the size of the pretraining dataset affects the downstream performance. We randomly pick up 5K, 50K, 500K, and 1M (original size) data points from the initial pretraining dataset without augmentation, and pretrain TransPolymer with them and compare the results with those by TransPolymer trained with 5M augmented data. The results are summarized in Supplementary Table 5. Plus, Fig. 4 presents the bar plot of R2 for each experiment we have performed. Error bars are included in the figure if cross-validation is implemented in experiments. As shown in the table and the figure, the results demonstrate a clear trend of enhanced downstream performance (decreasing RMSE and increasing R2) with increasing pretraining size. In particular, the model performance on some datasets, for example, PE-I, Nc, and OPV, are even worse than training TransPolymer from scratch (the results by TransPolymer unpretrained in Table 2-5). A possible explanation is that the small amount of pretraining size results in the limited data space covered by pretraining data, thus making some downstream data points out of the distribution of pre-\n",

However, the performance on all the downstream tasks increases significantly if both the Transformer encoders and the regressor head are finetuned, which indicates that the regressor head only is not enough to learn task- specific information. In fact, the attention mechanism plays a key role in learning not only generalizable but also task-specific information. Even though the pretrained TransPolymer is transferable to various downstream tasks and more efficient, it is necessary to finetune the Transformer encoders with task-related data points for better performance.\n",

The comparison between the model performance on downstream tasks with pretraining on the original ~1M dataset and the augmented ~5M dataset (shown in Supplementary Table 5) has already demonstrated the significance of data augmentation in model performance en- hancement. In this part, we use the model pretrained on the ~5M augmented pretraining dataset but finetune TransPolymer without augmenting the downstream datasets to inves- tigate to what extent the TransPolymer model can improve the best baseline models for downstream tasks. The model performance enhancement with or without data augmenta- tion compared with best baseline models is summarized in Table 8.

For PE-II dataset, however, TransPolymerpretrained is not comparable to the best baseline model without data augmentation since the original dataset contains only 271 data points in total. Because of the data-greedy characteristics of Transformer, data augmentation could be a crucial factor in finetuning, especially when data are scarce (which is very common in chem- ical and materials science regimes). Therefore, data augmentation can help generalize the model to sequences unseen in training data.\n",

This trend makes sense because the nearby tokens in polymer SMILES usually represent atoms bonded to each other in the polymer, and atoms are most significantly af- fected by their local environments. Therefore, the first hidden layer, which is the closest layer to inputs, could capture such chemical information. In contrast, the attention scores from the last hidden layer tend to be more uniform, thus lacking an interpretable pattern. Such phenomenon has also been observed by Abnar et al. who discovered that the embeddings of tokens would become contextualized for deeper hidden layers and might carry similar information. 63\n",

In addition to polymer SMILES, the sequence also includes 'F[B-](F)(F)F', '0.17', '95.2', '37.0', '-23', and 'S_1' which stand for the anion in the electrolyte, the ratio between lithium ions and functional groups in the polymer, comonomer percentage, molecular weight (kDa), glass transition temperature (Tg), and linear chain structure, respectively. As is illustrated in Fig. 6, the '(s)' token tends to focus on certain tokens, like the '*', '$', and '-23', which are marked in red in the example sequence in Fig. 6. Since Tg usually plays an important role in determining the conductivity of polymers, 64 the finetuned Transpolyemr could understand the influential parts on prop- erties in a polymer sequence. However, it is also widely argued that the attention weights cannot fully depict the relationship between tokens and prediction results because a high attention score does not necessarily guarantee that the pair of tokens is important to the prediction results given that attention scores do not consider Value matrices. 65 More related work is needed to fully address the attention interpretation problem.\n",

      "## 3 Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we have proposed TransPolymer, a Transformer-based model with MLM pre- training, for accurate and efficient polymer property prediction. By rationally designing a polymer tokenization strategy, we can map a polymer instance to a sequence of tokens. Data augmentation is implemented to enlarge the available data for representation learn- ing. TransPolymer is first pretrained on approximately 5M unlabeled polymer sequences by MLM, then finetuned on different downstream datasets, outperforming all the baselines and unpretrained TransPolymer. The superior model performance could be further explained by the impact of pretraining with large unlabeled data, finetuning Transformer encoders, and data augmentation for data space enlargement. The attention scores from hidden layers in TransPolymer provide evidence of the efficacy of learning representations with chemical awareness and suggest the influential tokens on final prediction results.\n",
      "\n",
      "23\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the desirable model performance and outstanding generalization ability out of a small number of labeled downstream data, we anticipate that TransPolymer would serve as a potential solution to predicting newly designed polymer properties and guiding polymer design. For example, the pretrained TransPolymer could be applied in the active-learning- guided polymer discovery framework, 66,67 in which TransPolymer serves to virtually screen the polymer space, recommend the potential candidates with desirable properties based on model predictions, and get updated by learning on data from experimental evaluation. In addition, the outstanding performance of TransPolymer on copolymer datasets compared with existing baseline models has shed light on the exploration of copolymers. In a nutshell, even though the main focus of this paper is placed on regression, TransPolymer can pave the way for several promising (co)polymer discovery frameworks.\n",

      "## 4.1 Polymer tokenization\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike small molecules which are easily represented by SMILES, polymers are more com- plex to be converted to sequences since SMILES fails to incorporate pivotal information like connectivity between repeating units and degree of polymerization. As a result, we need to design the polymer sequences to take account of that information. To design the polymer sequences, each repeating unit of the polymer is first recognized and converted to SMILES, then '*' signs are added at the places which represent the ends of the repeating unit to indi- cate the connectivity between repeating units. Such a strategy to indicate repeating units has been widely used in string-based polymer representations. 68,69 For the cases of copolymers, \".' is used to separate different constituents, and '^' is used to indicate branches in copolymers. Other information like the degree of polymerization and molecular weight, if accessible, will be put after the polymer SMILES separated by special tokens. Take the example of the sequence given in Fig. 1(a), the sequence describes a polymer electrolyte system including\n",
      "\n",
      "24\n",
      "\n",
      "two components separated by the special token '|'. Descriptors like the ratio between re- peating units in the copolymer, component type, and glass transition temperature (Tg for short) are added for each component separated by '$', and the ratio between components and temperature are put at the end of the sequence. Adding these descriptors can improve the performance of property predictions as suggested by Patel et al. 29 Unique 'NAN' tokens are assigned for missing values of each descriptor in the dataset. For example, 'NAN_Tg' indicates the missing value of glass transition temperature, and 'NAN_MW' indicates the missing molecular weight at that place. These unique NAN tokens are added during finetun- ing to include available chemical descriptors in the datasets. Therefore, different datasets can contain different NAN tokens. Notably, other descriptors like molecular weight and de- gree of polymerization are omitted in this example because their values for each component are missing. However, for practical usage, these values should also be included with unique 'NAN' characters. Besides, considering the varying constituents in copolymers as well as components in composites, the 'NAN' tokens for ratios are padded to the maximum possible numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "When tokenizing the polymer sequences, the regular expression in the tokenizer adapted from the RoBERTa tokenizer is transformed to search for all the possible elements in poly- mers as well as the vocabulary for descriptors and special tokens. Consequently, the polymer tokenizer can correctly slice polymers into constituting atoms. For example, 'Si' which rep- resents a silicon atom in polymer sequences would be recognized as a single token by our polymer tokenizer whereas 'S' and 'i' are likely to be separated into different tokens when using the RoBERTa tokenizer. Values for descriptors and special tokens are converted to single tokens as well, where all the non-text values, e.g., temperature, are discretized and treated as one token by the tokenizer.\n",
      "\n",
      "25\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.2 Data augmentation\n",
      "\n",
      "To enlarge the available polymer data for better representation learning, data augmentation is applied to the polymer SMILES within polymer sequences from each dataset we use. The augmentation technique is borrowed from Lambard et al. 70 First, canonicalization is removed from SMILES representations; then, atoms in SMILES are renumbered by rotation of their indices; finally, for each renumbering case, grammatically correct SMILES which preserve isomerism of original polymers or molecules and prevent Kekulisation are reconstructed. 31,71 Also, duplicate SMILES are removed from the expanded list. SMILES augmentation is implemented by RDKit library.72 In particular, data augmentation is only applied to training sets after the train-test split to avoid information leakage.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.3 Transformer-based encoder\n",
      "\n",
      "Our TransPolymer model is based on Transformer encoder architecture. 34 Unlike RNN-based models which encoded temporal information by recurrence, Transformer uses self-attention layers instead. The attention mechanism used in Transformer is named Scaled Dot-Product Attention, which maps input data into three vectors: queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V). The attention is computed by first computing the dot product of the query with all keys, dividing each by vdk for scaling where dk is the dimension of keys, applying softmax function to obtain the weights of values, and finally deriving the attention. The dot product between queries and keys computes how closely aligned the keys are with the queries. Therefore, the attention score is able to reflect how closely related the two embeddings of tokens are. The formula of Scaled Dot-Product Attention can be written as:\n",
      "\n",
      "Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax\n",
      "\n",
      "QKT Vdk\n",
      "\n",
      "V\n",
      "\n",
      "(1)\n",
      "\n",
      "-\n",
      "\n",
      "Multi-head attention is performed instead of single attention by linearly projecting Q, K, and V with different projections and applying the attention function in parallel. The outputs\n",
      "\n",
      "26\n",
      "\n",
      "are concatenated and projected again to obtain the final results. In this way, information from different subspaces could be learned by the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The input of Transformer model, namely embeddings, maps tokens in sequences to vec- tors. Due to the absence of recurrence, word embeddings only are not sufficient to encode sequence order. Therefore, positional encodings are introduced so that the model can know the relative or absolute position of the token in the sequence. In Transformer, position encodings are represented by trigonometric functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "PEpos,2i = sin (pos/100002i/dmodel )\n",
      "\n",
      "(2)\n",
      "\n",
      "PEpos,2i+1 = cos (pos/100002i/dmodel)\n",
      "\n",
      "(3)\n",
      "\n",
      "where pos is the position of the token and i is the dimension. By this means, the relative positions of tokens could be learned by the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.4 Pretraining with MLM\n",
      "\n",
      "To pretrain TransPolymer with Masked Language Modeling (MLM), 15% of tokens of a sequence are chosen for possible replacement. Among the chosen tokens, 80% of which are masked, 10% of which are replaced by randomly selected vocabulary tokens, and 10% are left unchanged, in order to generate proper contextual embeddings for all tokens and bias the representation towards the actual observed words. 35 Such a pretraining strategy enables TransPolymer to learn the \"chemical grammar\" of polymer sequences by recovering the original tokens so that chemical knowledge is encoded by the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pretraining database is split into training and validation sets by a ratio of 80/20. We use AdamW as the optimizer, where the learning rate is 5 x 10-5, betas parameters are (0.9, 0.999), epsilon is 1 × 10-6, and weight decay is 0. A linear scheduler with a warm-up ratio of 0.05 is set up so that the learning rate increases from 0 to the learning rate set in the optimizer in the first 5% training steps then decreases linearly to zero. The batch size is\n",
      "\n",
      "27\n",
      "\n",
      "set to 200, and the hidden layer dropout and attention dropout are set to 0.1. The model is pretrained for 30 epochs during which the binary cross entropy loss decreases steadily from over 1 to around 0.07, and the one with the best performance on the validation set is used for finetuning. The whole pretraining process takes approximately 3 days on two RTX 6000 GPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.5 Finetuning for polymer property prediction\n",
      "\n",
      "The finetuning process involves the pretrained Transformer encoder and a one-layer MLP regressor head so that representations of polymer sequences could be used for property predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the experimental settings of finetuning, AdamW is set to be the optimizer whose betas parameters are (0.9, 0.999), epsilon is 1 × 10-6, and weight decay is 0.01. Different learning rates are used for the pretrained TransPolymer and regressor head. Particularly, for some experiments a strategy of layer-wise learning rate the decay (LLRD), suggested by Zhang et al., 73 is applied. Specifically, in LLRD, the learning rate is decreased layer-by- layer from top to bottom with a multiplicative decay rate. The strategy is based on the observation that different layers learn different information from sequences. Top layers near the output learn more local and specific information, thus requiring larger learning rates; while bottom layers near inputs learn more general and common information. The specific choices of learning rates for each dataset as well as other hyperparameters of the optimizer and scheduler are exhibited in Supplementary Table 2. For each downstream dataset, the model is trained for 20 epochs and the best model is determined in terms of the RMSE and R2 on the test set for evaluation.\n",

      "The data augmentation strategies for downstream datasets are summarized in Supplemen- tary Table 1. Copolymer data are augmented by generating equivalent SMILES of each repeating unit respectively. Different limitations on the amount of augmented data are ap- plied considering the capacity of the computational resources we have. For example, each repeating unit in the PE-I dataset is allowed to be augmented to two, and each SMILES in the OPV dataset are allowed to generate five in total. For datasets like Ei which consist of a small amount of data (usually hundreds of data) with limited sequence length (around or even smaller than 100), each polymer sequence is allowed to generate as many augmented ones as possible.\n",

We search the hyperparameters to obtain the best performance, which is summarized in Supplementary Table 4. Besides, we have also trained random forest with ECFP6 fingerprints5 to provide a direct comparison with SOTA fingerprinting strategies.

      "## LSTM Gradient Diminishing\n",
      "\n",
      "From Table 2-5 in the manuscript, LSTM gives the worst performance on most of the down- stream tasks. Plus, we even observe that the model performance is not improved if we reduce the model size from 6 layers, 768 hidden size to 2 layers, 256 hidden size, and add a convolution layer before the LSTM layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to investigate the reason for the poor performance of LSTM on the property prediction tasks, we provide the visualization of gradient flow across LSTM layers in Supple- mentary Figure 3 to check whether the models suffer from the diminishing gradient problem. The models are trained on the Ei dataset for which five-fold cross-validation is applied. We plot the gradient of each layer for every back-propagation step and present them in a sin- gle figure for each LSTM architecture. Darker colors in the figures indicate that there are more bars at that place. The mean gradient suffers from the diminishing problem for all three models, while the maximum gradient does not diminish significantly for smaller models (two LSTM layers). Even though LSTM is better at remembering information from past hidden states in long sequences than regular RNNs, it is still confronted with the gradient diminishing problem in this situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, we include the train and test loss versus epoch plots in Supplementary Figure 4 for different model architectures. We can tell from the loss vs. epoch plots that in many folds the training is early stopped before reaching 20 epochs due to the non-decreasing test\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "loss, which means it is very easy for LSTM to overfit even though dropout and time and frequency masking are used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The experiment results strongly suggest that LSTM is not capable of representation learning from polymer sequences. In comparison, the good performance of Transformer on the same dataset highlights the advantage of the attention mechanism in understanding chemical knowledge from polymer sequences.\n",

      "From Table 2-5 in the manuscript, LSTM gives the worst performance on most of the down- stream tasks. Plus, we even observe that the model performance is not improved if we reduce the model size from 6 layers, 768 hidden size to 2 layers, 256 hidden size, and add a convolution layer before the LSTM layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to investigate the reason for the poor performance of LSTM on the property prediction tasks, we provide the visualization of gradient flow across LSTM layers in Supple- mentary Figure 3 to check whether the models suffer from the diminishing gradient problem. The models are trained on the Ei dataset for which five-fold cross-validation is applied. We plot the gradient of each layer for every back-propagation step and present them in a sin- gle figure for each LSTM architecture. Darker colors in the figures indicate that there are more bars at that place. The mean gradient suffers from the diminishing problem for all three models, while the maximum gradient does not diminish significantly for smaller models (two LSTM layers). Even though LSTM is better at remembering information from past hidden states in long sequences than regular RNNs, it is still confronted with the gradient diminishing problem in this situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, we include the train and test loss versus epoch plots in Supplementary Figure 4 for different model architectures. We can tell from the loss vs. epoch plots that in many folds the training is early stopped before reaching 20 epochs due to the non-decreasing test\n",

      "The experiment results strongly suggest that LSTM is not capable of representation learning from polymer sequences. In comparison, the good performance of Transformer on the same dataset highlights the advantage of the attention mechanism in understanding chemical knowledge from polymer sequences.\n",

Polymer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to exploit existing polymer data for efficient design of functional polymers.

      "Polymers are one of the most important classes of material in modern society, as its applica- tions range from the plastic bags and bottles used in daily life to a variety of electronics, and even structural components in the aerospace industry. A polymer is a material made of a col- lection of chains that are built by connecting many repeated units, called monomers. These chains can form diverse structures that contribute to the highly diverse physical and chemi- cal properties of different types of polymers. Some polymers can be consisting of more than one type of monomer to form even more complicated topological structures across different length scales. The research field of polymer science and engineering emerged to understand, control, and design novel polymers that can be used to satisfy the rapidly growing demand on highly functional materials coming from different aspects of modern life. While polymers can be categorized into natural or synthetic polymers, we will focus our discussion on the latter in this paper.\n",

      "Following the mainstream of materials science, polymer science has gone through mul- tiple major paradigm shifts. The early studies of polymers flourished in the first half of the 20th century was closely associated with H. Staudinger who received the Nobel Prize in 1953.1 Initially, discovery of polymers was mainly based on an empirical approach, i.e., relying on many trial-and-error experiments. Accumulation of experimental experiences has led to developments of theoretical and simple statistical models for guiding the design of new\n",

      "polymers. These include many important work by the 1974 Nobel prize recipient P. J. Flory, the group contribution method and so on.2-4 Following the rapid advances of computing power in the last few decades, computational methods has become one of the main tools to study properties of polymers.5 Recent developments of simulation techniques for vari- ous types of polymers opened up opportunities to computationally study polymers across different length scales. 6,7 While generating experimental data of polymers is often costly and time-consuming, modern supercomputers provide new opportunities for building larger databases of polymers computationally. With the drastic expansion of data size in science, a data-driven approach for scientific discovery is said to be the 4th paradigm of science. Poly- mer informatics is an interdisciplinary research field of polymer science, computer science, information science and machine learning that serves as a platform to mine the precious polymer data for new knowledge. Yet, there has been notable challenges of the development of polymer informatics attributed to the complex hierarchical structures of polymers. 8,9\n",

      "Design of a polymer can be broken down into three parts corresponding to the three steps in the typical production process of polymers: design of monomers (polymerization), microstructures (crystallization), and material processing (manufacturing) (see Figure 1). Monomers, the building blocks of polymers, contribute to the foundation of potential prop- erties of the eventually produced polymers. While molecular size is one of the important factors that influences the properties of an organic material, the \"size effect\" of polymers is not directly correlated with the size of the monomers because a large collection of small monomers (e.g., ethylene) can also build long polymer chains the same way large monomers do. Instead, various metrics based on the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of a poly- mer are often used as a reference to relate the \"size of polymer\" to polymer properties. Different polymers built from the same monomer can have different MWD by controlling the polymerization process, which can lead to significantly different physical and chemical properties. 10-12 Furthermore, the collection of polymer chains can form very different crystal structures through a variety of crystallization processes, affecting the material properties of\n",

      "the resulting polymers. For example, Yi et al. controlled the crystallinity and orientation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) molecules to optimize the performance of solar cells. 13 Finally, the same type of polymer in the microscopic scale can undergo different manufacturing pro- cess, such as stretching or mixing additives, to further enhance or alter its properties in order to fulfil specific needs from a broad range of applications. 14 Ideally, the design space of polymers covers all parameters involved in the three production steps, for example, the molecule space of a single or multiple monomer(s) (namely homopolymers or copolymers, respectively), temperature and types of polymerization process, additives or fillers, molding methods, etc. In practice, we often focus on a subset of the parameters while keeping other fixed to reduce the enormous search space. For example, Wu et al. focused on the design of monomer that has a high probability of making liquid crystal polymers with high thermal conductivity after compressed to a polymer thin film. 15\n",

For example, in PoLyInfo, 16,17 which is one of the largest database of polymers, around 30% of data related to thermal properties are covered by only 10 different polymers and over 40% of data is glass transition temperature (see Figure 2). In order to achieve a fully data-driven process of polymer design, continuous efforts have been made to bridge the demand of machine learning technologies and the current state of polymer informatics. In this paper, we review and discuss the applications of machine learning on different aspects of the polymer design process through four perspectives: polymer databases, representation (descriptor) of polymers, predictive models for polymer properties, and polymer design strategy.

      "One of the most important components in machine learning is data. The quality and quantity of available data determine the scope of solvable problems in an application. A rule of thumb in machine learning is that purely data-driven models are not reliable when extrapolating. In other words, it is dangerous to trust the prediction of a model on a material that is not similar to the ones in the training data. Therefore, high quality large database for a diverse set of polymers is always of high demand in polymer informatics. Table 1 shows a list of online databases that contain polymer data. There also exists large amount of publications on polymer technology or database that collects recipes of polymer synthesis (e.g., NIST Synthetic Polymer MALDI Recipes Database23).

These issues have become the bottleneck for the development of polymer informatics.8 With the advancements of computational simulation technologies and supercomputers, we expect an increasing interest and opportunity to build large scale com- putational databases of polymers. Meanwhile, technology of high-throughput experiments 28 and the use of robotics combined with artificial intelligence29 provide new opportunities to build experimental database of polymers efficiently.

      "## Descriptor\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental purpose of a material descriptor is to uniquely encode materials in a com- pact form in order to allow for efficient machine learning. This is particularly difficult for polymers due to their hierarchical structures. 30 An example of unique representation of polymers would be the Polymer Markup Language, which is designed to include complete information of a polymer ranging from compositional information to all the processing pa- rameters.31 While this representation may be suitable for building polymer databases, it is not compact enough to be used as input of a model for machine learning purposes. In fact, a good material descriptor should consider the tradeoff between ability to uniquely represent a material, easiness to obtain or calculate, and sensitivity to targeted application. 32 In other words, while possible, it is unlikely that a single descriptor can be used for all polymer ap- plications. For example, to search for an efficient polyimide for controlled inkjet deposition, descriptor needs to be sensitive to specific microstructures formed by the polymer chains. 33 On the other hand, designing polymers with certain phase transition properties will require a descriptor that identifies key atomic-level structures. Different level of \"fineness\" of de- scriptor should be selected depending on the physical and chemical properties of interest to the target problem. 34 One example that attempted to capture such hierarchy of descriptor in a Python package is the Materials knowledge systems. 35 Here, we introduce and compare a few descriptors that could be useful in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing conditions of polymers, such as temperature, additives and solvents, can be directly included in a descriptor. Representations of the microstructure and molecular struc- ture of polymer chains are less intuitive. Certain machine learning models in deep learning allow direct use of images as input, but often require a significant amount of data to train the models. 36 Persistant homology is a technique to extract statistical features from topo- logical structures, 37 but its application in polymer informatics is yet to be investigated. Graphical kernel is another option to numerically encode the polymer structures that can be represented in a simple graph. 38 However, finding an efficient graph representation for\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "\n",
      "the complex polymer structures is challenging, especially because different types of polymer chains can form structures in different length scales. Many of the descriptors commonly used in polymer informatics focus on capturing the molecular structure of monomers composing the polymer chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Material descriptors or fingerprints developed for small organic molecules are directly applicable to represent polymers based on their monomers. Modern machine learning al- gorithms also allow direct use of molecular graph or simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) 39 strings as input of a model. 40 Picking a descriptor suitable for the prob- lem of interest may significantly improves the efficiency of machine learning. 34 However, such representation omits information about the chemical bonds between the monomers. An al- ternative is to consider oligmer consisting of n monomers, but there is no clear answer to how to pick n. The larger n is, the more representative the oligmer would be to the polymer. Nevertheless, certain types of descriptors, such as the physical descriptors, will take signifi- cantly longer time to calculate for a larger molecule. Furthermore, some fingerprints could be biased toward polymers with smaller or larger monomers depending on the choice of n. For example, a fingerprint that counts if there are more than 3 benzene rings in a molecule will not be able to distinguish between polystyrene and poly(bisphenol A carbonate) when n > 3. Figure 3 shows how different fingerprints may have different convergence behavior with respect to n. Wu et al. proposed to calculate descriptor of polymers using an infinitely long chain of their corresponding monomers. 19 However, the bias issue for some fingerprints remains unsolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymer chain can be separated into a backbone and its side chains. Distinguishing the two components is theoretically important to predict polymer properties. However, it is not clear how to efficiently encode such information into a general descriptor for different classes of polymers. Similarly, developing descriptors for polymers consisting of more than one type of monomer is still an open challenge. For alternating copolymer, we can simply consider the combined repeating unit of multiple monomers as a \"metamonomer\", but the molecule\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the key components in polymer design is the prediction of polymer properties relevant to a target application. Some of the important properties often considered in the polymer industry include transparency, glass transition temperature, toughness, etc.41 The ability to predict properties of different classes of polymers opens up new computational design approaches for polymers, such as high-throughput screening and inverse design, which will be discussed in the next section. One approach to predict polymer properties is building empirical equations based on physical descriptors and some basic properties of polymers.\n",

      "\n",
      "An effort to collect such equations in Python has been made by the thermo package. 42 This approach can be very powerful, but could be difficult to use when predicting properties for a new design with not much knowledge available yet. Another approach that is more suitable for design purpose, called the quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) modeling, aims at mapping structural descriptors of a material to its property. In particular, models that rely only on 2D structure information of the polymer is preferred as it avoids intensive geometry optimization for the polymer molecules. To date, around 300 articles can be found on the web of science database when searching with keywords QSPR and polymer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Group contribution method is one of the earliest data-driven approaches to predict com- plex properties of different polymers.3 The basic idea is that certain groups of bonded atoms within different molecules may have common effects on a specific material property. Linear regression is used to model the interaction between groups when data is limited, but higher order models can also be used. Machine learning models using fingerprints as input can be seen as an extension to this idea, since the fingerprints are collections of rules that check the existence of different structural groups. Some commonly used models include elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, Gaussian process, neural network, etc. Table 2 summarizes some recent applications of these algorithms in polymer informatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning models are inherently interpolative, i.e., their predictions are reliable only around the domain close to the training data. The range of properties prediction for certain types of polymers with a reasonable accuracy governs the potential search space one can cover, i.e., the performance of the final design. In other words, the training data determines the feasible design space of the target application. The concept of applicability domain (AD) developed in Cheminformatics is used to quantify the reliable region of a QSPR model. 49 The concept of uncertainty in statistics is also a popular metric believed to be strongly correlated with the validity of a prediction. 50 Figure 4 shows how different models fail to predict different materials properties when extrapolating from the given data.

      "One can also use a library from any open databases. Otherwise, a generative algorithm is needed to construct a pool of candidates of interest. For example, a conventional approach is to define a set of molecular fragments of interest and exhaustively combine different num- bers of fragments up to an upper limit to form the candidate set. Fragment can be obtained from organic molecules which have more large open databases, such as GDB-1756 or Pub- chem. 57 To expand beyond the search space limited by a finite variety of fragments, Wu et al. implemented a language model proposed by Ikebata et al. 59 on polymers represented in SMILES.58 Different deep neural networks are also used to learn the SMILES or graph representation of organic molecules. 60-62\n",

      "Giving a library of candidates, one can use pretrained predictive models to computation- ally screen out candidates with target properties. There is a significant amount of literature that applies high-throughput screening to different polymer applications. Recent exam- ples of high-throughput screening in polymer designs using machine learning models include searching of high refractive index polymers46,63,64 and screening optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers. 65 This strategy of polymer design may sound inefficient to solve a single design problem, because a significantly large library is needed to increase the probability of finding candidates of interest. However, a well-developed library that contains diverse candi- dates can be reused for many different design problems. With a rich database of candidates, high-throughput screening is a very attractive tool in many industrial applications.\n",

      "\n",
      "Another design strategy, referred as the inverse design, is to perform targeted search in a materials space guided by knowledge extracted from existing data. While predictive model is a mapping from an input x (polymer) to an output y (material property), the goal of inverse design is to map a targeted range of y to a sub-domain of x. This can be achieved by solving an optimization problem using sophisticated algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, or by sampling the set of x with high probability to be in the targeted range of y under a\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for fixed number of times or until convergence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In step 2, a generative algorithm is needed to propose new candidates similar to the one in the high-throughput screening. In the case of optimization, the likeliness metric in step 3 is usually a loss function measuring the distance of the predicted properties for the candidates and the targeted properties. For sampling, the likeliness metric is usually correlated with the probability of observing the candidates conditional on the targeted properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inverse design problem is inherently ill-posed, i.e., there are different types of mate- rials that may have the target properties. It is important that an inverse design algorithm can produce a diverse set of candidates in order to maximize the probability of discovering novel functional materials. Typical optimization algorithm can only search for the optimal solution. Sampling methods can have a higher chance to provide diverse candidates, but can also be trapped in a local mode, especial when the search space is high dimensional. Many efforts have been made to address this issue, such as limiting the search space size, projecting the search space to a low dimensional space, or employing an annealing algorithm, etc. Table 3 shows some recent examples of successful inverse design of different polymer applications using machine learning technologies.\n",

There are two perspectives to the optimality of candidate selection: (1) exploit the knowledge embedded in the existing data to make the best guess of which candidates may satisfy the design goal, or (2) explore candidates with the least information from the existing data to infer their properties. In a typical experimental design algorithm, we define a utility function that balance the tradeoff between the two perspectives.

      "approach of polymer design will significantly improve the pace of making new functional polymers, satisfying the rapidly expanding demand on polymeric materials in modern society (e.g., deformable electronic devices74). One of the most important elements of polymer informatics is the availability of large open databases. Building such databases for polymer is challenging because of many reasons: (1) difficulty of encoding the hierarchical structure of polymers for machine learning purposes, (2) inconsistent naming rules throughout the history of polymer science, (3) lack of data sharing due to many privately own industrial data, etc. Nonetheless, this is an essential step towards a fully data-driven design process. Many efforts have been made to build the backbone technologies necessary to exploit the potential benefit of polymer informatics, such as developing new descriptors to better capture the physical properties of polymers and new simulation methods to estimate polymer properties with higher accuracy in a shorter time. The true power of polymer informatics is to release polymer scientists from the low efficiency trial-and-error design process, thus, to free up more time for higher level design concepts and theoretical advancements. Such opportunity can be realized only if we work together to push for a more open community in polymer science, where everyone can benefit from the new paradigm of polymer design. An easy first step to take would be to engage in the field of polymer informatics and experience the new way of studying polymers ourselves.\n",

Traditionally used monomer-based representations fall short in capturing the periodic, extended nature of polymers, leading to inaccurate property predictions. The authors propose a novel polymer graph representation that inherently encodes the periodicity within its structure. Through the use of a message-passing neural network (MPNN), this representation helps in the automatic learning of chemically-relevant polymer descriptors directly from polymer property datasets. In comparison to previous hand-designed monomer-based representations, the proposed approach showed a notable 20% average reduction in prediction error across a diverse set of 10 polymer properties.\n",

When one envisions the transformative role of materials in the modern world, polymers are undoubtedly at the forefront. These versatile macromolecules are ubiquitous, shaping industries from healthcare to aerospace through their myriad applications. The crux of leveraging these polymers lies in the sophisticated art and science of polymer representation, which is a pivotal field within material science and has far-reaching implications in numerous sectors.\\n\\nImagine the profound impact polymers have made in the field of medicine, illustrated by the case of biodegradable sutures—once a futuristic concept, now a commonplace reality. The journey from concept to application rests solidly on the ability of scientists to accurately model and predict the properties of potential polymer materials. This exemplifies the real-world significance of polymer representation: turning theoretical potential into practical solutions.\\n\\nPolymer representation is grounded in foundational principles that seek to describe these complex materials in a form amenable to analysis and prediction. Whether it is the flexibility of a plastic bottle or the tensile strength of a Kevlar vest, each characteristic is the result of polymer chains\\' behaviors, which researchers attempt to elucidate through various modeling techniques. Challenges abound—from capturing the vast diversity of polymer structures to predicting their behaviors under different conditions.\\n\\nThe pioneering work in the field of Polymer Quantum Mechanics, as put forth by Angel Garcia-Chung [1], expands the horizon of our understanding through a representation of the symplectic group in polymer quantum mechanics. This work is part of a growing transcription of polymers\\' complex behaviors via advanced mathematical frameworks that delve into the very fabric of the material world.\\n\\nIn tandem with these theoretical advancements, the domain of polymer informatics utilizes machine learning tools to dramatically enhance the identification and design of novel polymers, as articulated by notable researchers such as Stephen Wu et al. [2] and Lihua Chen et al. [3]. The integration of data science in polymer representation has unlocked unprecedented predictive capabilities, evidenced by the efforts of Evan R. Antoniuk and colleagues, who have achieved considerably improved polymer property predictions [4].\\n\\nThe roadmap ahead for polymer representation is filled with both promise and complexity. As research endeavors, such as those highlighted in \\'TransPolymer: a Transformer-based language model for polymer property predictions\\' by Changwen Xu et al. [5], broaden the scope of computational models, we stand on the cusp of a revolution that will enable the design of materials with an accuracy and specificity previously unattainable.\\n\\nAs we delve deeper into the molecular intricacies of polymers, the potential applications and improvements that can stem from advanced representation methods persist as a driving force behind ongoing studies. The quest for more efficient, sustainable, and high-performance polymers necessitates a continuous refinement of modeling techniques, a challenge that pioneering scientists and researchers are grappling with in their labs as we speak.\\n\\n## 2. \\nHistorical Advances and Current Capabilities in Polymer Representation\\n\\nThe journey through the complex and captivating landscape of polymer representation marks a path distinguished by scientific rigor and ingenious advancements. The narrative of this rich history is not merely a record of past achievements but rather the foundation upon which the computational methodologies of today are built.\\n\\nFrom the early days of Staudinger\\'s groundbreaking hypothesis, which brought forth the concept of macromolecules, to the development of modern polymer science — each epoch has witnessed milestones that shaped our understanding and depiction of these intricate materials. Not only did these advancements clarify the structure and properties of polymers, but they also charted a course for the evolution of representation frameworks, enabling us to visualize and predict polymer behaviors in unprecedented detail.\\n\\nTrailblazers in the field have toiled to resolve the challenges of representing polymers, each approach more innovative than the last. For instance, \\'Thermal Transport in Polymers: A Review\\' by Wei et al. [1], underscores the importance of accurately capturing the complexity of thermal processes within polymers, a significant aspect influencing their representation.\\n\\nAdvancements in the discipline surged forward as researchers like Stephen Wu and colleagues examined the potential of polymer informatics and machine learning in \\'Potentials and challenges of polymer informatics: exploiting machine learning for polymer design\\' [2]. Their work showed the power of data-driven approaches to transcend traditional barriers in design and representation. Furthermore, the research exposed critical challenges such as lack of open databases and unified structural representation.\\n\\nThe complexity of polymer chemistry was honored by cutting-edge computational strategies as detailed in the paper \\'Chemical Potential of a Flexible Polymer Liquid in a Coarse-Grained Representation\\' by Dinpajooh et al. [3]. Their scientific inquiry paved the way for better representations through coarse-grained models, which are now instrumental in simplifying complex structures for computational study.\\n\\nThese historical forays into the realm of polymer representation have culminated in a contemporary understanding that deftly navigates the traits of these versatile materials. Today, leveraging computational tools, scientists can predict polymer behaviors, fine-tune their properties, and imagine new applications.\\n\\nAs we segue into the next section, we find it successively rooted in our historical narrative. Current computational approaches to polymer representation have flourished from these past successes and learning challenges, setting a robust groundwork upon which novel and transformative methodologies continue to emerge. This evolution translates the meticulous work of our predecessors into a language spoken by supercomputers and algorithms, proposing a future where the properties and potentialities of polymers are unveiled with the click of a mouse.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3. \\nComputational Approaches to Polymer Representation\\n\\nPolymer science is at the cusp of transformation thanks to advances in computational methods for representing polymeric materials. The accurate representation of polymers is of critical importance as it directly impacts material design and the prediction of polymer properties. Here, we delve into the latest computational approaches—including graph-based models, quantum mechanics frameworks, and machine learning techniques—and compare their benefits and challenges.\\n\\nThe symplectic group in Polymer Quantum Mechanics\\' by Garcia-Chung demonstrated the application of polymer quantum mechanics to the symplectic group, offering insights into polymer behavior at the quantum level without needing a polymer scale initially. The study poses a significant advancement although the implied non-unitary evolution of the polymer harmonic oscillator marks a limitation, suggesting areas for further research.\\n\\nIn contrast, the machine learning domain has seen remarkable progress. The paper by Wu et al., \\'Potentials and challenges of polymer informatics: exploiting machine learning for polymer design,\\' discusses the use of machine learning to leverage existing polymer databases effectively. Machine learning aids in developing predictive models for polymer properties and creating innovative polymer design strategies. Despite the potential, the field faces considerable challenges, such as the need for unified structural representation and more open databases.\\n\\nTaking representation a step further, Antoniuk et al. employed graph-based neural networks in \\'Representing Polymers as Periodic Graphs with Learned Descriptors for Accurate Polymer Property Predictions\\'. This method, which encodes the periodicity of polymers into a graph structure combined with message-passing neural networks, showed a 20% reduction in prediction error over traditional hand-designed descriptors. The success of this model lies in its ability to automatically learn descriptors that are chemically relevant, thus improving predictive accuracy.\\n\\nThe advent of Transformer-based language models for polymer informatics as showcased by Xu et al. in \\'TransPolymer: a Transformer-based language model for polymer property predictions\\' represents a cutting-edge integration of natural language processing techniques for the prediction of polymer properties. Being recently published, this model holds promise for the future of polymer informatics and computational chemistry at large.\\n\\nThe Summary Table below compares the pros and cons of each approach discussed:\\n\\n| Computational Method  | Pros                                             | Cons                                              |\\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\\n| Polymer Quantum Mechanics | Quantum-level insights, no initial polymer scale | Non-unitary evolution, complexity                 |\\n| Machine Learning      | Predictive models, design strategy advancement   | Need for unified representation, data limitations |\\n| Graph-based Neural Networks | Automatic learning of descriptors, reduced error | May require extensive data for training           |\\n| Transformer-based Language Models | State-of-the-art NLP techniques, high potential    | Requires further research and validation          |\\n\\nThe contributions to standardization can\\'t be understated as these computational methods aid in catalyzing unified approaches to polymer representation, which is crucial for effective data exchange and application in industry settings. While the applications of these computational methods span across diverse fields such as material science, biomedical engineering, and environmental sustainability, they also carry certain limitations such as computational cost, data availability, and generalization to different classes of polymers.\\n\\nTo ensure these computational methods contribute positively to our society and the environment, ethical considerations need to be addressed, including the responsible use of data and the environmental impact of polymer production. Advancements in polymer representation, coupled with responsible stewardship, hold the key to addressing global challenges through innovation in materials science.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4. \\n\\nTrailblazing Progress: Innovative Methodologies and Technologies\\n\\nIn the realm of technological advancements, recent innovations have not only set the pace for rapid growth but have also illuminated the path to untapped potentials.

This not only accelerates product development but also optimizes materials for specific uses, thereby increasing safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Educational initiatives are also emerging, aiming to integrate these technologies into curriculums to equip the next generation of scientists with robust and versatile toolsets.\\n\\nOne illustrative example is the development of Monte Carlo simulations for polymer research. These stochastic algorithms, which use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle, allow scientists to predict the behavior of polymers under various conditions. Such simulations can lead to breakthroughs in creating materials with desired properties, as highlighted in the study \"Monte Carlo Simulations in Polymer Science.\"\\n\\nThe industry has also seen significant strides with 3D printing technologies leveraging polymer representations to create complex structures which were once deemed impossible. From medical implants tailored to individual patients to lightweight materials for aerospace applications, the implications of this innovation span far-reaching domains.\\n\\nHowever, with such sophisticated technologies come challenges that need to be addressed. Issues related to the scalability, accuracy, and computational resource requirements are ongoing and highlight the need for continuous innovation.
