In this paper we provide the representation of the symplectic group Sp(2n, R) in poly- mer quantum mechanics. We derive the propagator of the polymer free particle and the polymer harmonic oscillator without considering a polymer scale. The polymer scale is then introduced to reconcile our results with those expressions for the polymer free particle. The propagator for the polymer harmonic oscillator implies non-unitary evolution.

Polymer quantum mechanics (PQM) is a quantization scheme mimicking some of the techniques used in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC)[1-5]. That is to say, at kinematical level, the Hilbert spaces used in both quantizations are the mathematically the same. Also, their observable algebras are given by their corresponding Weyl algebras, on the reduced phase space for the LQC scenario and on the standard phase space in the PQM case [1, 6-8].

The main feature of these quantizations is that the Stone-von Neumann theorem is evaded. Con- sequently, the quantum description of LQC is non-unitarily equivalent to the so-called Wheeler-De Witt (WDW) quantization [8], whereas PQM is non-unitarily equivalent to the usual Schrödinger representation of standard quantum mechanics [1]. Based on this, PQM can be considered as a theoretical lab for some of the techniques used at kinematical level in LQC.

An intrinsic aspect of PQM is the introduction of a length scale, called polymer scale which is the analog of the Planck length in loop quantum cosmology and loop quantum gravity. This scale, denoted by u, is introduced when the square of the momentum operator in the Hamiltonian is replaced by a combination of Weyl generators depending on u.

The effect of what this replacement might induce on the symmetries of 'polimerically' quantized systems have been explored in some papers [9, 10]. However, a key ingredient on this direction is still absent: the linear canonical transformations. These transformations are the symplectic group action of the phase space and leave the Hamilton equations of motion invariant. A relevant feature

of this group, denoted by Sp(2n, R), is that time evolution of linear systems can be described as a curve in the group. Therefore, a representation of the symplectic group in PQM will pave the way to study time-evolution and more general linear symmetries.

On the other hand, in the last decades, the symplectic group has played a relevant role in the construction of squeeze states [11-13] and their separability conditions [14, 15]. In cosmological sce- narios, some approaches use squeezed states to explore entropy production [16] and time-evolution of matter degrees of freedom [17]. In LQC, Squeezed states have been considered in [18-20] to explore the robustness of the bounce. Due to the connection between the symplectic group and the squeeze operator [13], a representation of this group in PQM, and thus in LQC, may offer new insights for constructing generalized squeezed states, i.e., to extend their use to systems with more degrees of freedom.

For these reasons, in this paper we give the representation of the symplectic group Sp(2n, R) in PQM. Our construction was done within the full polymer Hilbert space and no polymer scale was considered at the first stage of the analysis. As a result, the propagators for the free particle and the harmonic oscillator are also derived in the full polymer Hilbert space. We then insert the polymer scale in our results and discuss its implications.

This paper is organized as follows: in Section (II) we provide the unitary representation of the symplectic group in the standard quantum mechanics and its expansion to momentum representa- tion. We also show how the propagators of the quantum free particle and the quantum harmonic oscillator emerge from the given representation. Section (III) summarizes the main features of poly- mer quantum mechanics to be used for the construction of the representation of Sp(2n, R) given in Section (IV). The propagators for both polymer systems, the free particle and the harmonic oscillator are derived in Section (V). We discuss our results in Section (VI).

The unitary representation of the symplectic group in the Schrödinger representation was de- rived by Mochinsky and Quesne in [21] and revisited by K. Wolf in [22]. In order to be self- contained, we summarize the construction of the unitary representation of Sp(2n, R) in this section. We follow on the lines of [21, 22] together with [23].
