      "Quantum chemistry is a branch of chemistry focused on the application of quantum mechanics to chemical systems, involving the study and understanding of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. It seeks to predict chemical and physical properties through scalable computational methods, but traditional approaches face significant limitations due to the complexity and sheer number of calculations required.\n",

Neural networks can learn from data and improve their predictions over time. They’ve shown remarkable success in various fields, from image recognition to natural language processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand the impact of neural networks on quantum chemistry, let's examine a real-world case study that illustrates typical limitations in traditional computational chemistry and the potential of neural networks to surmount these challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent breakthrough in computational chemistry involved the prediction of molecular behavior that traditional methods found too resource-intensive. The study in question utilized neural networks to simulate molecular energy states, a task usually requiring extensive trial-and-error to map accurately. Neural networks significantly reduced time and computational resources by learning from and predicting molecular behaviors, dealing with a complexity that would have been insurmountable by conventional means.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neural networks empower computational breakthroughs by providing an enhanced method for the exploration and prediction of complex molecular behaviors. As referred to in the 2019 paper titled 'Unifying machine learning and quantum chemistry -- a deep neural network for molecular wavefunctions,' deep neural networks can predict molecular wavefunctions with high accuracy (Schütt et al., 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, a neural network can process vast amounts of data, learning from existing molecular simulations to predict outcomes for new, untested molecules. A pertinent visual illustration of this is a graph depicting the performance of neural networks versus traditional computational methods in predicting molecular properties. The graph shows a steep curve of improvement in accuracy with the introduction of neural networks, underscoring the pivotal role they play in advancing the field of quantum chemistry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the convergence of quantum chemistry and neural networks signals a transformational leap in our ability to predict and manipulate the molecular world. Not only are neural networks able to address the computational challenges of traditional methods, but they also enable the exploration of chemical systems with previously unattainable precision and efficiency.\n",

      "In the rapidly evolving world of technology, neural networks have emerged as one of the most intriguing and complex advancements of our time. Bridging the gap between the highly technical aspects of neural networks and the general understanding of curious, non-specialized readers requires an approach that simplifies without sacrificing accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neural networks are inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute human brains. Imagine a network as a bustling city map, where intersections are \"neurons,\" and roads are \"synapses\" that connect these neurons. The neurons communicate through these synapses using electrical signals, much like cars traveling to convey information. Flowcharts or diagrams can serve as visual aids to represent this concept. These visuals should depict layers of interconnected nodes, resembling a neuron's web, with inputs entering one side and outputs exiting the other, symbolizing the flow of data through the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beauty of a neural network lies in its ability to learn and improve over time. Initially, the connections between these 'neurons' within the network (the city's roads) aren't ideal; they may have potholes or lead to dead ends. However, as the network is trained—fed with more data and given feedback on its performance—these connections improve, just like a city upgrading its infrastructure. This learning process can be represented with a graph, showing performance on the vertical axis and training time on the horizontal axis, illustrating the network's learning curve or improvement over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further demystify the concept for our readers, let's consider interactive visual elements, such as infographics and simulations, that allow the audience to 'play' with parameters, witnessing real-time changes in the network's behavior. For instance, an interactive simulation could allow users to add or remove layers and neurons, or adjust the weights of connections, and see how these changes might affect the ability of the network to learn a pattern or solve a problem.\n",

      "Employing analogies and visual aids not only makes the content more engaging but also enhances comprehension. By tapping into intuitive understandings, such as comparing a neural network's learning process to a city's road system development, we can make abstract concepts relatable and grasping the functionalities of a neural network less intimidating.\n",

A prime instance of this revolutionary transition is the advent of the neural network-based Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which significantly reduces the resource requirements traditionally associated with quantum chemical calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The VQE works by utilizing a hybrid quantum-classical approach, wherein a quantum processor is directed to prepare the quantum state of a molecule's electrons, while classical computers optimize the quantum circuit parameters. This reduces the number of quantum operations required, curtailing the computational expense traditionally faced by quantum scientists. The impacts are profound, with studies showing that VQE can determine molecular ground state energies with markedly higher efficiency than classical methods can provide.\n",

      "Additionally, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is another modern methodology that has emerged in the quantum chemistry field with the potential to further boost computational efficiency. QML algorithms are trained to predict molecular properties based on quantum states, thereby enabling rapid and resource-friendly exploration of chemical space. Research by researchers indicates that QML models can accurately predict electronic properties, like energy levels and electron distributions, thousands of times faster than conventional quantum mechanical simulations, sometimes reducing the computational time from days to mere seconds.\n",

      "Beyond algorithms, there’s also the implementation of neural network-based potential energy surfaces (NN-PES). These are mathematical landscapes that encapsulate the energetic relationships between atoms in molecules or materials. Traditional computing methods for calculating NN-PES are often computationally demanding, but newer neural network approaches are refining these calculations, turning them into less computationally expensive, yet highly accurate, tasks. As a result, scientists can simulate complex molecular dynamics which was previously impossible or restricted due to computational limitations.\n",

Quantum chemistry is the branch of chemistry focused on the application of quantum mechanics to chemical systems, fundamentally concerned with the behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules. It draws on the laws of physics to predict and explain the chemical and physical properties of matter at the molecular level.\n",

In machine learning, they represent a significant leap forward, as they can learn from experience, automatically improve their performance as more data becomes available, and deal with a vast amount of variables and dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A real-world case study highlighting the traditional limitations in computational chemistry readily illustrates the potential of neural networks in this field. For years, drug discovery has been a primary focus of computational chemistry, but the sheer number of possible molecular configurations—numbering in the tens of millions—makes the identification of successful drug candidates a daunting task. Classical computational methods are often too slow and fail to explore the vast chemical space effectively. The integration of neural networks into this process has the potential to overcome these limitations by accelerating the exploration and identification of novel drugs, achieving in days what might normally take months or years.\n",

      "This unifying potential between quantum chemistry and neural networks has led to notable computational breakthroughs. Neural networks, with their ability to process massive datasets and learn complex patterns, can help overcome the combinatorial explosion of variables involved in quantum chemical problems. A concrete example is the development of deep neural network models for molecular wavefunctions, which can predict electronic properties with a high degree of accuracy and without the need for computationally expensive traditional quantum mechanical calculations.\n",

      "{\"text\":\"Cutting-edge neural networks are redefining the boundaries of quantum chemistry, bringing forth a new realm where computational costs are no longer roadblocks to discovery. A prime instance of this revolutionary transition is the advent of the neural network-based Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which significantly reduces the resource requirements traditionally associated with quantum chemical calculations.\\n\\nThe VQE works by utilizing a hybrid quantum-classical approach, wherein a quantum processor is directed to prepare the quantum state of a molecule's electrons, while classical computers optimize the quantum circuit parameters. This reduces the number of quantum operations required, curtailing the computational expense traditionally faced by quantum scientists. The impacts are profound, with studies showing that VQE can determine molecular ground state energies with markedly higher efficiency than classical methods can provide.\\n\\nAdditionally, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is another modern methodology that has emerged in the quantum chemistry field with the potential to further boost computational efficiency. QML algorithms are trained to predict molecular properties based on quantum states, thereby enabling rapid and resource-friendly exploration of chemical space. Research by researchers indicates that QML models can accurately predict electronic properties, like energy levels and electron distributions, thousands of times faster than conventional quantum mechanical simulations, sometimes reducing the computational time from days to mere seconds.\\n\\nBeyond algorithms, there's also the implementation of neural network-based potential energy surfaces (NN-PES). These are mathematical landscapes that encapsulate the energetic relationships between atoms in molecules or materials. Traditional computing methods for calculating NN-PES are often computationally demanding, but newer neural network approaches are refining these calculations, turning them into less computationally expensive, yet highly accurate, tasks. As a result, scientists can simulate complex molecular dynamics which was previously impossible or restricted due to computational limitations.\\n\\nTo visually describe the efficiency improvements brought by these advancements, a comparison graph can illustrate the dramatic reduction in computational time and resources from classical quantum chemical methods to those enhanced by neural networks.\\n\\nThese modern methodologies are not only bolstering computational efficiency but are significantly democratizing access to quantum chemical tools. By lowering computational and resource barriers, small academic institutions and less-funded research teams can now partake in cutting-edge quantum chemistry research, ushering a more inclusive era of scientific exploration and innovation.\",\"paper_title\":\"The Variational Quantum Eigensolver: A Review of Methods and Best Practices\",\"paper_url\":\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03685v2\",\"reason\":\"Confirmation of the benefits and efficacy of VQE in quantum chemistry\"}\n",

      "  \"text\": \"As we step into a future brimming with technological promise, it is paramount to contextualize the next-generation breakthroughs in terms of their ethical, scalability, and industry-readiness challenges. These innovations have the potential to shape industries, redefine our daily lives, and impact the global community in transformative ways. However, they carry a multitude of considerations that must be addressed to achieve a sustainable and equitable techno-societal landscape.\\n\\nEthical considerations, particularly with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing, are multifaceted. On one hand, there are the moral implications of data privacy and security; on the other, there are broader questions regarding the socio-economic impacts, such as job displacement and inequality. An ethical framework that oversees the development and application of these technologies is imperative. For instance, requiring that AI systems be transparent and explainable can help mitigate the risks of biased decision-making and enhance public trust.\\n\\nScalability challenges also play a critical role, especially when considering the infrastructure and resources needed to bring a breakthrough technology from the lab to the masses. This is often seen in renewable energy technologies like solar photovoltaics or wind turbines, where initial high costs and logistical complexities can impede widespread deployment. A graph illustrating the decline in costs of these technologies over time as a function of production scale and innovation could effectively demonstrate the scalability potential.\\n\\nIndustry readiness is the third pillar that dictates the pace at which technological adoptions occur. It encompasses not only the technical compatibility of new technologies with existing industry processes but also the readiness of the workforce and consumers to adopt and adapt to these changes. Training and education initiatives thus become as crucial as the advancements themselves.\\n\\nFinally, the sustainable impact and future transformative potential of these breakthroughs must be assessed on a global scale. This includes evaluating the environmental footprint, resource consumption, and the ability to facilitate inclusivity and close digital divides. The potential for technology to enable sustainable development goals (SDGs) offers an optimistic outlook, though careful planning and international cooperation are necessary to materialize these outcomes.\\n\\nTo illustrate these complex relationships visually, an infographic combining ethical considerations, scalability factors, and industry readiness, all intersecting with sustainable impact, would aid readers in understanding how these themes interplay to influence the trajectory of future breakthroughs.\\n\\nIn conclusion, as we foresee the evolution of technology, it is not only the capabilities of the innovations that drive progress but also our collective ability to navigate their implications responsibly. The technological utopia envisioned for tomorrow requires a foundation of ethical practice, scalable solutions, industry preparedness, and a steadfast commitment to sustainability today.\",\n",

      "{\"text\":\"Cutting-edge neural networks are redefining the boundaries of quantum chemistry, bringing forth a new realm where computational costs are no longer roadblocks to discovery. A prime instance of this revolutionary transition is the advent of the neural network-based Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which significantly reduces the resource requirements traditionally associated with quantum chemical calculations.\\n\\nThe VQE works by utilizing a hybrid quantum-classical approach, wherein a quantum processor is directed to prepare the quantum state of a molecule's electrons, while classical computers optimize the quantum circuit parameters. This reduces the number of quantum operations required, curtailing the computational expense traditionally faced by quantum scientists. The impacts are profound, with studies showing that VQE can determine molecular ground state energies with markedly higher efficiency than classical methods can provide.\\n\\nAdditionally, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is another modern methodology that has emerged in the quantum chemistry field with the potential to further boost computational efficiency. QML algorithms are trained to predict molecular properties based on quantum states, thereby enabling rapid and resource-friendly exploration of chemical space. Research by researchers indicates that QML models can accurately predict electronic properties, like energy levels and electron distributions, thousands of times faster than conventional quantum mechanical simulations, sometimes reducing the computational time from days to mere seconds.\\n\\nBeyond algorithms, there's also the implementation of neural network-based potential energy surfaces (NN-PES). These are mathematical landscapes that encapsulate the energetic relationships between atoms in molecules or materials. Traditional computing methods for calculating NN-PES are often computationally demanding, but newer neural network approaches are refining these calculations, turning them into less computationally expensive, yet highly accurate, tasks. As a result, scientists can simulate complex molecular dynamics which was previously impossible or restricted due to computational limitations.\\n\\nTo visually describe the efficiency improvements brought by these advancements, a comparison graph can illustrate the dramatic reduction in computational time and resources from classical quantum chemical methods to those enhanced by neural networks.\\n\\nThese modern methodologies are not only bolstering computational efficiency but are significantly democratizing access to quantum chemical tools. By lowering computational and resource barriers, small academic institutions and less-funded research teams can now partake in cutting-edge quantum chemistry research, ushering a more inclusive era of scientific exploration and innovation.\",\"paper_title\":\"The Variational Quantum Eigensolver: a review of methods and best practices\",\"paper_url\":\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.05176v3\",\"reason\":\"Confirming the VQE's role in reducing computational costs in quantum chemistry\"}\n",

      "Technological innovations hold the key to future societal transformation, but with their potential come considerable ethical, scalability, and industry readiness challenges that must be carefully navigated. Let's delve deeper into these themes with insights from the latest research.\n",
      "\n",
      "When addressing **ethical considerations**, it is acknowledged that technologies, especially in fields like artificial intelligence and biotechnology, bring forward complex issues surrounding data privacy and socio-economic impacts, including job displacement (Sloane & Zakrzewski, 2022). Ethical frameworks that highlight AI transparency and explicability are seen as essential mitigators of biased decision-making, fostering enhanced public trust (Chaudhry et al., 2022; Chun & Elkins, 2024; John-Mathews, 2021; Khan et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scalability challenges** are inherent in the adoption of renewable energy technologies, where initial costs and complex infrastructure can be barriers (Meneguzzo et al., 2016). However, the declining cost curve for technologies such as solar photovoltaics corresponds with increased production scale and continuous innovation, underscoring the importance of policy support for smooth scalability (Brown & Reichenberg, 2020; Barbar et al., 2022; Kobashi et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of **industry readiness** goes beyond the technical compatibility of new technologies; it also gauges workforce and consumer adaptability. As we forge towards becoming a quantum-ready ecosystem, the intersection of technological compatibility with workforce preparedness is evident (Purohit et al., 2023; Hobbs et al., 2022; Mylonas et al., 2020; Akbar et al., 2022; Kumari et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, a critically important aspect is the **sustainable impact** of technology. The intersection of innovation with social and environmental sustainability is highlighted in a range of research, encompassing energy-sustainable IoT connectivity (López et al., 2023) to sustainability-driven exploration of topological materials (Boonkird et al., 2023). Continued efforts in system support for environmentally sustainable computing in data centers, green road freight practices, and machine learning applications in agile manufacturing using recycled materials align with sustainability goals (Chen, 2024; Gupta et al., 2024; Varde & Liang, 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "On a macro level, **global technology adoption** leans on international cooperation to further sustainable development. There have been calls for actionable international partnerships in space-science programs (Jani, 2016) and the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for smart sustainable agriculture solutions (Alreshidi, 2019). Precedents like the United Nations Basic Space Technology Initiative (Balogh & Haubold, 2012) showcase the potential that global partnerships hold in fostering technology transfer and sustainable outcomes (Welz & Stuermer, 2020; Fay & Flöther, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "As we advance with cautious optimism, it's clear the transformative potential of tomorrow's technologies hinges on striking a balance across ethical frameworks, scalable innovation, industry evolution, and comprehensive sustainable strategies on both local and global scales.\n",

This reduces the number of quantum operations required, curtailing the computational expense traditionally faced by quantum scientists. The impacts are profound, with studies showing that VQE can determine molecular ground state energies with markedly higher efficiency than classical methods can provide.\n",

      "Additionally, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is another modern methodology that has emerged in the quantum chemistry field with the potential to further boost computational efficiency. QML algorithms are trained to predict molecular properties based on quantum states, thereby enabling rapid and resource-friendly exploration of chemical space. Research by researchers indicates that QML models can accurately predict electronic properties, like energy levels and electron distributions, thousands of times faster than conventional quantum mechanical simulations, sometimes reducing the computational time from days to mere seconds.\n",

These are mathematical landscapes that encapsulate the energetic relationships between atoms in molecules or materials. Traditional computing methods for calculating NN-PES are often computationally demanding, but newer neural network approaches are refining these calculations, turning them into less computationally expensive, yet highly accurate, tasks. As a result, scientists can simulate complex molecular dynamics which was previously impossible or restricted due to computational limitations.\n",

      "|Keywords: Quantum computing Variational methods|The variational quantum eigensolver (or VQE), first developed by Peruzzo et al. (Nature Comm.5, 4213 (2014)), has received significant attention from the research community in recent years. It uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits facing exact modeling of the exponentially growing electronic wavefunction for these many-electron systems. The VQE may be used to model these complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. One important advantage is that variational algorithms have been shown to present some degree of resilience to the noise in the quantum hardware. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm, but without clear descriptions of how the diverse parts fit together. The potential practical advantages of the algorithm are also widely discussed in the literature, but with varying conclusions. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims at disentangling the relevant literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm, and to discuss future areas of research that are fundamental for the VQE to deliver on its promises. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail. These include the representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process to find ground state energies, the post processing mitigation of quantum errors, and suggested best practices. We identify four main areas of future research:(1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions required; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers; (3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process for large systems, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated in a tractable manner. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.|\n",

      "Quantum computing has undergone rapid development over recent years: from first conceptualization in the 1980s [1, 2], and early proof of principles for hardware in the 2000s [3-14], quantum computers can now be built with hundreds of qubits [15-17]. While the technology remains in its infancy, the fast progress of quantum hardware and the massive financial investments all over the world have led many to assert that so-called Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices [18, 19] could outperform conventional computers in the near future [20-23]. NISQ devices are near-term quantum computers, with a limited number of qubits, and too few physical qubits to implement robust error correction schemes. Existing NISQ computers have already been shown to outperform conventional computers on a limited set of problems designed specifically to fit quantum computers' capabilities [20-22]. Algorithms running on these restricted devices may require only a small number of qubits, show some degree of noise resilience, and are often cast as hybrid algorithms, where some steps are performed on a quantum device and some on a conventional computer. In particular, the number of operations, or quantum gates, must remain moderate, as the longer it takes to implement them, the more errors are introduced into the quantum state, and the more likely it is to decohere. Due to these restrictions, there are severe limits on the scope of algorithms that can be considered. In particular, well-known quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm [6, 24-30] for factoring prime numbers, or Grover's algorithm [31-36] for unstructured search problems, are not suitable.\n",

      "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) was originally developed by Peruzzo et al. [37], and its theoretical framework was extended and formalized by McClean et al. in Ref. [38]. The VQE is among the most promising examples of NISQ algorithms. In its most general description, it aims to compute an upper bound for the ground-state energy of a Hamiltonian, which is generally the first step in computing the energetic properties of molecules and materials. The study of electronic structures is a critical application for quantum chemistry (for instance: [39-41]) and condensed matter physics (for instance: [42, 43]). The scope of VQE is therefore very wide-ranging, being potentially relevant for drug discovery [44, 45], material science [46], chemical engineering [47]. Conventional computational chemistry, grounded in nearly a century of research, provides efficient methods to approximate such properties, but it becomes intractably expensive for very accurate calculations on increasingly large systems. This poses challenges in the practical application of such methods. One of the main reasons why computational chemistry methods can lack sufficient accuracy in molecular systems is an inadequate treatment of the correlations between constituent electrons. These interactions between electrons formally require computation that scales exponentially in the size of the system studied (i.e. the total time it takes to implement the computation is an exponential function of the system size), rendering exact quantum chemistry methods in general intractable with conventional computing. This limitation is well studied in the literature addressing simulation of quantum computers on conventional computers, Ref. [48] provides an excellent example.\n",
      "\n",
      "This bottleneck is the motivation for investigating methods such as the VQE, with the anticipation that these could one day outperform the conventional computing paradigm for these problems [49, 50]. In 1982, Richard Feynman\n",

      "theorized that simulating quantum systems would be most efficiently done by controlling and manipulating a different quantum system [2]. An array of qubits obey the laws of quantum mechanics, the same way an electronic wavefunction does. The superposition principle [51, 52] of quantum mechanics means that it can be exponentially costly to encode the equivalent information on conventional devices, while it only requires a linearly growing number of qubits. In the context of electronic structure theory [53-55] this is the appeal of quantum computing: it offers the possibility to model and manipulate quantum wavefunctions exactly, beyond what is possible with conventional computing. While largely dominated by electronic structure research, the VQE and its extensions have also been applied to several other quantum mechanical problems which face similar scaling issues. These notably include nuclear physics [56, 57] and nuclear structure problems [58, 59], high-energy physics [60-62], vibrational and vibronic spectroscopy [63-68], photochemical reaction properties predictions [69, 70], periodic systems [71-73], resolution of non-linear Schrödinger equations [74], and computation of quantum states of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole or Kantowki- Sachs cosmology [75].\n",
      "\n",
      "The VQE starts with an initialized qubit register. A quantum circuit is then applied to this register to model the physics and entanglement of the electronic wavefunction. Quantum circuit refers to a pre-defined series of quantum operations that will be applied to the qubits [76]. The number of consequential operations in a circuit is referred to as depth. This circuit is defined by two parts: (1) a structure, given by a set of ordered quantum gates, often referred to as an 'ansatz'; and (2) a set of parameters that dictates the behavior of some of these quantum gates. Once the quantum circuit has been applied to the register, the state of the qubits is designed to model a trial wavefunction. The Hamiltonian of the system studied can be measured with respect to this wavefunction to estimate the energy. The VQE then works by variationally optimizing the parameters of the ansatz in order to minimize this trial energy, constrained to always be higher than the exact ground state energy of the Hamiltonian by virtue of the variational principle [77-79]. For the VQE to be tractable, it is necessary that the number of quantum operations required to model the wavefunction is sufficiently low, imposing a relatively compact ansatz. The VQE admits wavefunction ansätze which cannot be efficiently simulated on conventional computers, indicating a possible advantage over conventional approaches if these quantum circuits are sufficiently accurate trial wavefunctions [37]. A first demonstration of the potential of these quantum ansätze was shown in [37], where an ansatz with polynomially-scaling depth in the size of the qubit register was constructed using principles grounded in conventional quantum chemistry (namely, the Unitary Coupled Cluster, which is discussed in more detail in Sec. 6.2.2). Since then, many alternatives have been proposed, with ansätze scaling as low a linearly [80] in the size of the qubit register. It must be understood however that a shallower ansatz, i.e. with fewer necessary quantum operations, will in general cover an overall smaller span of the space of all possible wavefunctions, and could result in lower accuracy of the ground state energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the design of the ansatz is core to the VQE and to the theoretical underpinnings of its potential advantage over conventional methods, there are many other parts of the algorithm that directly affect the cost and feasibility of the approach. We provide a discussion for each of these parts in our review, and briefly outline them here. To begin with, once one has chosen a quantum system to study, one must decide on how to construct its Hamiltonian. It is a requirement of the VQE that the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of individual terms, where the number of terms increases with system size relatively slowly. This is a feature of electronic Hamiltonians, where the Coulomb interaction, a sum of two-body terms, scales polynomially in the system size [81]. Often there is considerable flexibility and freedom in the specific choice or how a Hamiltonian is represented mathematically. This step is critical, as it impacts all aspects of the VQE: number of qubits, depth of the ansatz, and the total number of measurements required. Once a Hamiltonian is constructed, one must translate it into operators that can be directly measured on a quantum computer (spin or Pauli operators), which can again impact the depth of the ansatz and number of measurements. The next step is to decide on an ansatz, which must be expressive enough to be able to approximately model the ground state wavefunction, but not so much that it results in circuits that become too deep, or parameterizations that are too complex to efficiently train. Once an ansatz is selected, one must choose an appropriate optimizer, which significantly impacts the convergence rate of the VQE optimization and the overall cost of the algorithm. Measurements on quantum devices are effectively stochastic [76], meaning that to obtain the expectation value of an operator, one must repeat measurements enough times to achieve a given level of precision. The number of measurements required is not only defined by the required precision, but also by the number of operators in the Hamiltonian. Adopting efficient measurement strategies is critical for controlling the implementation cost of VQE. Finally, to reduce the possible impact of quantum noise on the accuracy of the result, one can introduce error mitigation strategies into the individual measurements, which again need consideration of their associated computational cost.\n",

      "This review holds two main purposes: (1) provide an overview for each of the different components of the VQE algorithm outlined above, along with a suggestion for best practices found in the literature. Because of the large variety of quantum systems the VQE can handle, we propose sets of best practices for two different and fairly general types of systems: ab initio molecular systems and spin-lattice models, though it is likely that some of the conclusions can be generalized to other Hamiltonians, including impurity models, condensed matter, vibrational spectroscopy or nuclear structure; (2) identify a list of open research questions regarding the future applicability of the VQE, and about individual aspects of the algorithm presented above. We identify four significant (and inter-related) hurdles, which impact the future viability of this method. These are presented here at a high level and discussed throughout the review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, several studies have considered the scaling of the number of measurements as the system size increases [82-85]. Despite scaling polynomially [38], the number of measurements required can nonetheless rapidly become too large for the method to be viable [82, 83, 85]. As a consequence, many studies have called for developments in efficient measurement schemes (for instance, Ref. [85]), with approaches to find compact representations of the Hamiltonian and judicious use of joint measurement of commuting observables an ongoing source of developments in this endeavor (see Sec. 5.2.4).\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, an alternative approach to the measurement problem could lie in the enormous potential for paralleliza- tion of VQE. This potential was clearly called for in the original VQE paper of Peruzzo et al. [37], but has received relatively little consideration from the community, in particular with respect to efficient strategies for this parallelization and possible communication overheads (further discussion on these points is found in Sec. 2.7.2).\n",

      "Thirdly, variational quantum algorithms suffer from a common pitfall in the challenge of parameter optimization: the so-called barren plateau problem [82, 86, 87]. The barren plateau is a result of the phenomenon that gradients of the VQE parameters vanish exponentially with the number of qubits used in the model [86], in the overall expressibility of the ansatz [88], degree of entanglement of the wavefunction modeled [89, 90], or non-locality of the cost function [87, 91, 92]. This of course would prevent tractable optimization in larger systems. Many methods have been proposed to address this problem, but it is currently unclear whether these methods allow one to fully contain the barren plateau problem in the context of VQE (further discussions on this topic are found in Sec. 6.1). A related point is that the complexity of the optimization landscape for the VQE remains poorly understood. Bittel and Kliesch [93] characterized specific features of this landscape and demonstrated the risk of optimization being undermined by local minima and non-convex features. The underlying question here is the convergence rate of different optimizers, and the overall scaling of the number of iterations required to reach convergence as a function of the system size and entanglement in the wavefunction.\n",

      "Finally, the extent to which VQE is resilient to quantum noise and its ability to be mitigated in a tractable manner remains unclear. Variational algorithms have the advantage of exhibiting some ability to learn away certain types of systematic noise [94, 95]. While it was also shown that the cost of several error mitigation methods may largely outweigh the benefits [96], the question of the impact of quantum noise on VQE results and the predictability of these errors should be studied in much further depth than has been done so far. Overall, despite a number of impediments, the VQE has the potential to be among the first useful methods to be implemented on NISQ devices. However, as the hardware continues to progress, so must the theoretical underpinning of this approach, as well as the efficiency and robustness of the software and algorithms, to guarantee that the potential benefits of methods such as VQE can be tapped as early as possible.\n",

      "Structure of the review: Sec. 2 presents a more formal definition of the VQE, its potential advantages and limitations are discussed, and our assessment of the state-of-the-art VQE is presented. The following sections provide reviews of each of the components of the VQE pipeline (as also summarized in Fig. 1). The first step in the VQE process is to choose a representation for the molecular Hamiltonian (Sec. 3), this is followed by a description of the methods used to map fermionic operators to spin operators, therefore allowing the Hamiltonian operators to be directly measured on a quantum device (Sec. 4). The next section covers efficiencies that can be used to reduce the number of measurements required to estimate the expectation value of a Hamiltonian (Sec. 5). We then turn to detailing the various quantum circuit structures representing wave function ansätze that have been proposed as the core component of the VQE (Sec. 6). This is followed by a presentation of the most important optimization methods and how they relate to the VQE (Sec. 7). Finally, we list and discuss the main error mitigation techniques that could improve the overall accuracy of the algorithm (Sec. 8). We close our review with a discussion of relevant extensions of the VQE for quantum chemistry applications (Sec. 9).\n",

It is grounded in the variational principle (and more precisely in the Rayliegh-Ritz functional [77-79]), which optimizes an upper bound for the lowest possible expectation value of an observable with respect to a trial wavefunction. Namely, providing a Hamiltonian H, and a trial wavefunction |w), the ground state energy associated with this Hamiltonian, E0, is bounded by\n",

In mathematical terms, we aim to find an approximation to the eigenvector |w> of the Hermitian operator Ĥ corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue, Eo.\n",

We hence express |v) as the application of a generic parametrized unitary U(0) to an initial state for N qubits, with 0 denoting a set of parameters taking values in (-x, x]. The qubit register is generally initialized as |0)N, written as |0) for simplicity, although low-depth operations can be performed for alternative initializations before the unitary is applied.

We refer to the layering of these different components as the VQE pipeline. Most choices made on specific elements of this pipeline have significant implications on the entire VQE process. We summarize the iterative process (and the main VQE loop) in Fig. 1 to provide a schematic visual description of the algorithm and its main components. We list the key components below and provide a brief introduction to each of them and how they fit together:\n",
      "\n",
      ". Hamiltonian construction and representation: The first step in the VQE is to define the system for which we want to find the ground state. This can be an ab initio molecular Hamiltonian for electronic structure [81, 105-107], a solid-state system [42, 108-110], a spin lattice model [111], a nuclear structure problem Hamiltonian [59], or a Hamiltonian describing any other quantum system. For each of these, one starts with a specific geometry (or conformation) of the system, specifying for example the distance between each atom, or the geometry of the lattice. Constructing the Hamiltonian involves finding specific operators and their weights between basis functions spanning the physical problem, where the basis functions represent the individual single-particle degrees of freedom. Given the Hamiltonian defines the quantum observable for the total energy associated with a wavefunction, the choice of basis is critical to define the space its spans. It can have a significant impact on the accuracy and cost of the final result, as the type of basis and number of basis functions chosen both determine the size of the computation required and the accuracy of the representation. In the case of electronic structure, these different representations could include, as examples, molecular orbitals from a prior mean-field calculation, plane-wave functions, or local atomic functions, all representing the spatial distributions (or 'orbitals') for the single-particle Fock states, from which the many-body basis is formed [81]. Additional complexity arises when specifically looking at electrons: following the Pauli exclusion principle [112, 113] the wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of two electrons. From a mathematical perspective, this means that we must decide whether we enforce this antisymmetry through the definition of the wavefunction or through the definition of the operators. These are referred to (for historical reasons) respectively as first and second quantization [81]. In second quantization the Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of fermionic operators, also known as creation (â.) and annihilation (â;) operators. These correspond to the action of adding, or removing an electron from a given basis function with integer index j, respectively (e.g. an orbital or a lattice site), ensuring appropriate fermionic antisymmetry with respect to permutation of any two particles. We provide an introduction to Hamiltonian construction and discuss the wider implications of particular representation choices in Sec. 3.\n",

      "· Encoding of operators: Qubit registers on quantum computers can only measure observables expressed in a Pauli basis, due to the two-level nature of spins: Pa E {I, X, Y, Z]ON, for N qubits. In first quantization, the operators can be directly translated into spin operators that can be measured on quantum computers [98], as they are not used to enforce antisymmetry of the wavefunction - we briefly outline how this is done in Sec. 3.1.3. In second quantization the Hamiltonian is expressed as a linear combination of fermionic operators which are defined to obey this antisymmetry relationship, unlike Pauli operators. The role of a fermionic to spin encoding\n",

      "is therefore to construct observables, from Pauli operators, which maintain this relationship. A transformation of fermionic operators to spin operators that meets this criterion was demonstrated a long time ago [114], and recent research has focused on improving on this initial work. The key factors determining the efficiency of an encoding are their Pauli weight (the maximum number of non-identity elements in a given spin operator), the number of qubits required, and the number of Pauli strings produced. We provide a list of the most relevant encodings for second quantized Hamiltonians in Sec. 4. It is worth noting that for certain ansatz choices, in particular those defined in terms of fermionic operators, the encoding can have significant implications on gate depth and trainability (Sec. 6). Cases of encoding particles others than fermions (e.g. bosons), and which do not require antisymmetry to be enforced are far simpler and are presented directly with the relevant Hamiltonian representation in Sec. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Measurement strategy and grouping: The next step in the VQE pipeline is to determine how measurements are distributed and organized to efficiently extract the required expectation values from the trial wave function. In general, to achieve a precision of e on the expectation value of an operator, we are required to perform 0(1/€2) repetitions (usually denoted as shots) of the circuit execution, each completed with a measurement at the end [38]. The objective of the measurement strategy is to make the number of repetitions as low as possible. Several techniques are available to achieve this, in particular, the use of efficient weighting of the number of measurements across the operators [82, 115, 116]. This can be further optimized by using properties of the Lie algebra in which Pauli strings are defined. Via processing of the encoded Pauli strings to be measured, it is possible to identify commuting groups of operators that can be measured jointly, and subsequently find the measurement bases in which all operators of a given group can be simultaneously measured [117-119] (see Sec. 5.3). In order to perform this joint measurement, a short quantum circuit must therefore be designed and applied for each group, to rotate the measurement basis and to perform this joint measurement. Alternatively, because of information overlap between different Pauli strings, one can also try to reduce the number of measurements required using inference methods from fewer shots [120, 121], with further details in Sec. 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Ansatz and state preparation: Once the Hamiltonian has been prepared such that its expectation value can be measured on a quantum device, we can turn to the preparation of the trial wavefunction. In order to do this, one must decide on a structure for the parametrized quantum circuit, denoted as ansatz. It is used to produce the trial state, with which the Hamiltonian can be measured. Upon successful optimization of the ansatz parameters, the trial state becomes a model for the ground state wavefunction of the system studied. A wide range of ansätze are possible, and the appropriate choice depends on the problem being addressed. The key aspects of the ansatz are its expressibility and trainability. The expressibility defines the ability of the ansatz to span a large class of states in the Hilbert space [122, 123], defining the maximum accuracy its approximation of relevant low-energy states can achieve (assuming all parameters can be perfectly optimized). Its trainability describes the practical ability of the ansatz to be optimized using techniques tractable on quantum devices [87, 122] (related to the total number of parameters, their linear dependence, the structure of the optimization surface, and to the related concept of barren plateaus [86], which can arise when gradients almost vanish thereby preventing optimization). A good ansatz must be sufficiently expressive to guarantee that it can appropriately approximate the ground state wave function, however, it must not be so expressive that it renders the search for the target state intractable. Another important aspect of the ansatz choice is the scaling and complexity of its circuit depth with system size. This is particularly important for near-term application of the VQE, as it determines in great part the noise resilience of the method employed. Details about ansatz selection are presented in Sec. 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Parameter optimization: The parameters of the ansatz used need to be updated iteratively until convergence. In general, this requires sampling the expectation value of the Hamiltonian several times for a given parameter set in the ansatz in order to define an update rule for the parameters (i.e. the updated value of the parameters is a function of the expectation value measured). The choice of optimization is critical for at least three main reasons: (1) it directly impacts the number of measurements required to complete an optimization step, as e.g. computing the numerical gradient of a quantum circuit can require value estimation of the Hamiltonian with respect to several slightly modified wave functions (this is also generally true for gradient-free methods) [124, 125]; (2) certain optimizers have been designed to alleviate specific optimization issues, such as the barren plateau problem [126- 130]; (3) it directly impacts the number of iterations required to reach convergence (if it allows for convergence\n",

To do this, fermionic operators in the Hamiltonian are mapped to spin operators using an encoding (Sec. 4); (c) Grouping and measurement strategy: Third step in the pre-processing, where operators defined in (b) are grouped in order to be measured simultaneously later on, usually requiring an add-on to the quantum circuit for each group in order to rotate the measurement basis in a basis in which all operators in the group are diagonalized.

[90, 135]) (Sec. 6); (b) Basis rotation and measurement: Once the trial wave function has been prepared, it must be rotated into the measurement basis of the operator of interest (quantum computers in general measure in the Z basis), or a diagonal basis of a specific group of Pauli strings (c) Observable computation: The expectation value to be computed depend on the optimization strategy used, in any case however these are reconstituted by weighted summation on conventional hardware, or using a machine learning technique; (d) Parameters update: Based on the observables computed, and the optimization strategy, we can compute and apply updates to the ansatz parameters and begin a new iteration of the VQE (Sec. 7) - (3) Post-processing, Error mitigation: error mitigation is a layer of additional computation on measurement output (or directly on the quantum state prior to measurement) aimed at reducing the impact of quantum noise on the results (Sec. 8)\n",

      "It is worth briefly outlining the distinction between the VQE pipeline and that of other variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) [101]. The key distinguishing feature of VQE is that it is restricted to finding the eigenstate of a quantum observable, which is not necessarily the case of other VQAs (such as Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithms [136] or the Variational Quantum Linear Solver [137, 138]). As such, the process of encoding the Hamiltonian is peculiar to VQE. Similarly, while all VQAs would benefit from efficient measurements, the nature of the observable used in VQE (often scaling polynomially in the system size) mean that efficient grouping and measurements strategies will likely have a far greater impact on the overall scaling of the method.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar distinction can be drawn with the field of machine learning using Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) [139, 140]. While such methods can be considered as variational algorithms, the reverse is not necessarily true. Most VQAs, and the VQE, aim at finding the solution to a given problem from initial inputs. Machine learning on QNN aims at abstracting, and generalizing [141], a pattern from already solved problems used as initial input. As such the algorithmic pipeline and challenges of both methods are largely different. In the case of QNN, one will be less concerned about the representation of the observable and poorly scaling measurement requirements. Instead, deciding on the process for encoding conventional data into a quantum state (often referred to as quantum feature map) [142, 143] will be critical in determining potential for quantum advantage and is completely absent from the VQE pipeline.\n",

      "Quantum supremacy is achieved when algorithms running on quantum computers can produce results that surpass those generated on conventional computing resources in accuracy and/or resources required [144]. It was demonstrated on a tailored sampling task by several research teams [20-23], although the magnitude of the advantage has also been contested [145, 146]. Quantum advantage is in general used interchangeably with quantum supremacy, however we propose to use quantum advantage to refer to an instance of quantum supremacy where the advantage has relevant, tangible applications. This concept can rely on theoretical scaling arguments or practical demonstrations. A precise definition of the resources required and of the accuracy metrics is required for any specific demonstration of quantum advantage, which needs to include all overheads and initialization requirements. Computing resources can be defined in many different ways, including overall absolute runtime, time scaling, memory requirements, or indeed 'indirect' metrics such as the financial cost of the computation or energy consumption (for a discussion on the energy consumption of Quantum Computers, we recommend Ref. [147]).\n",
      "\n",
      "The VQE allows for the probabilistic measurement of observables over certain classes of parameterized ap- proximate wavefunctions, which can neither be sampled from nor have their properties computed efficiently (e.g. in polynomial time) on conventional devices as the system size gets large. Of course, this implies that the Hamiltonians studied can be written as a polynomially growing sum of independent observables [37], as is commonly found in a number of fields such as quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, or nuclear physics. We provide a more detailed description of these specific classes of wavefunctions (the ansatz of the VQE) in Sec. 6, while a comparison to alternative wavefunction classes, which can admit polynomial complexity on conventional computing resources, are described in Sec. 2.4. If these wavefunction forms, accessible via the VQE yet practically inaccessible via conventional means, admit sufficient accuracy in their approximation to the ground state, quantum advantage can be considered within this paradigm. The argument outlined above defines a necessary condition for the VQE to become a practically useful method for computing properties of quantum systems. It is clear from the literature, and outlined in Sec. 2.6, that under certain assumptions this condition is theoretically achievable [37, 80, 82, 148-150].\n",
      "\n",
      "There are however many restrictions of quantum computing that this approach does not take into account, and we therefore propose two more stringent conditions. The first one is that VQE must demonstrate similar or higher accuracy than any conventional method, but with lower computational time-to-solution. This condition takes into account possible limitations due to hardware runtime, potentially resulting in a large pre-factor for VQE computations. In this review, the pre-factor refers to the multiplier applied to a scaling rule to obtain the actual run time of the method. If the VQE has better asymptotic scaling than conventional methods, but a large pre-factor, this means an advantage could only be achieved in the asymptotic regime of very large systems (with runtime possibly too large for VQE to be realistically usable). This would make it difficult to demonstrate quantum advantage for practical moderately sized systems. The second condition, which is also the most stringent form of quantum advantage for the VQE, is to achieve at least as good accuracy, and with faster compute time, for a system of sufficient complexity to accurately model a real problem of physical and chemical relevance. This involves demonstrations on systems, where the approximation error in defining the specific Hamiltonian for the original problem is of smaller magnitude than its solution using the VQE. This could be as simple as ensuring that basis sets are sufficiently saturated [107], or that the complexity of the\n",

      "interactions with a wider system were sufficiently resolved. For instance, consider computing the energy of a series of protein-ligand complexes (for which methods extending VQE have already been proposed [151, 152]): even if the VQE achieves better accuracy in lower computation time, it is not guaranteed that these accuracy gains lead to a practical advantage. For example, the accuracy gains may still be insufficient to predict the most appropriate ligand in a physical experiment due to the approximations in the treatment of the environment in the Hamiltonian. Some researchers have attempted to estimate the tipping point for quantum computing-based quantum chemistry to overtake conventional methods. As one example, Elfving et al. [83] estimate the size of basis set (and hence the number of qubits) that would be required for a tangible quantum advantage of quantum computing based methods to lie somewhere between 19 and 34 molecular orbitals (or twice as many spin orbitals and hence twice as many qubits).\n",

      "Despite sound theoretical arguments for the polynomial scaling of VQE [37, 38], a number of potential limitations have been identified as well, which could prevent the VQE from achieving quantum advantage:\n",
      "\n",
      "· The VQE could be limited by a large pre-factor linked to the cost of accurate observable sampling. Several studies have analyzed the overall cost of VQE and whether it can reach a tipping point, at which it becomes advantageous compared to conventional methods [82, 83, 85]. They have so far all concluded that given certain assumptions and the current state of research surrounding VQE functionality, the algorithm cannot outperform conventional methods within a remit of applications considered tractable. The main bottleneck identified in these studies (based on noiseless estimates) is the substantial number of measurements that are required to estimate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian using VQE (for further details see Sec. 2.7). The field of research is fast-moving however, and much research has been devoted to efficient operator sampling (summarized in Sec. 5). Using the parallelization potential of VQE (see Sec. 2.7.2) could also be a solution to this measurement problem but would require a paradigm shift in the way quantum hardware is conceived.\n",
      "\n",
      "· The VQE involves solving an optimization problem. As such, to understand the true cost of implementing VQE, one needs to assess the complexity of the optimization process. The true cost and scaling are dependent on the optimizer and on the optimization landscape of the specific problem studied. While some optimizers have been shown to converge in polynomial time for convex cost functions, the VQE is far from having such a favorable landscape [93, 153]. In fact, the VQE optimization is shown to be NP-hard [93], which means that in the worst possible case, finding the optimal solution to the problem is intractable. Of course, this is to be expected as all optimization problems can suffer from the same issue [154]. The key open question is to know whether VQE can be optimized heuristically in a polynomial number of iterations and converge to an approximate yet accurate enough solution.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Even if one could show VQE would theoretically converge in a tractable number of iterations, this would assume that expectation values and gradients are computed exactly. This assumption is not valid in the context of quantum computation, and it has been shown that the number of measurements required to accurately measure gradients could scale exponentially in certain parameterizations of systems, due to the barren plateau problem [86] (discussed in detail in Sec. 6.1). A number of mitigating methods have been proposed, such as the identity block initialization [135] or the use of a local encoding for the Hamiltonian [87, 91]. Nevertheless, the extent to which barren plateaus can indeed be managed for VQE remains an open question.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Related to both of the above, the extent to which VQE is resilient to quantum noise is also an open question, but actively mitigating errors will likely be unavoidable for relevant use of NISQ algorithms. Although error mitigation methods have shown great success in improving the accuracy of VQE on the current generations of quantum computers (for instance [155-160]), it can significantly increase the resource requirements of the algorithm (see Sec. 8). It is unclear whether this increase in resources is an acceptable cost or likely to be a critical limitation in larger-scale application of the VQE. A recent paper [96] is rather pessimistic on this point, showing that the increase in cost is exponential when the ansatz circuit grows deeper. Conversely, it was suggested in the early days of VQE that variational algorithms possess inherent noise resilience since the optimization can effectively adapt to the noise [38]. This resilience has helped VQE to be more successful than other algorithms on the current generation of quantum devices, and has been numerically demonstrated in small qubit simulations [94]. However, it remains unclear whether this resilience from noise can be retained in larger quantum experiments, where one is confronted with a more complex ansatz, with more noise coming from the difficulty of controlling large numbers of qubits with precision.\n",

      "An important additional point to stress here is that while in theory the exact state could in principle be spanned by a number of qubits that scales linearly with system size, this exactness is in general forgone in VQE via the imposed parameterization. At this point, a strictly exact limit within a defined Hamiltonian is only expected to be recovered with an exponential number of variational parameters (and hence circuit depth) [161]. Therefore, to achieve advantage, the classes of states accessible within the VQE framework must admit superior approximations to quantum many-body systems of interest compared to accessible conventional descriptions of quantum states, as well as their scaling with system size. The key question regarding the realm of current applicability of the VQE is therefore whether it can achieve higher accuracy on at least some representative systems, with some appropriate resource metric, compared to conventional computational chemistry methods.\n",

      "The first step in any application of VQE to ab initio electronic structure is to define the basis functions determining the resolution and representation of the system. A common (but not required) approach to this would be to use the molecular orbitals obtained from a prior mean-field Hartree-Fock (for a description of this method, see Ref. [107]) or density functional theory (DFT) calculation [162-165] (for comprehensive reviews of DFT, see Refs. [166, 167]). These orbitals are used to define the representation of the Hamiltonian (see Sec. 3), and thus compute the operator weights of the resulting Pauli strings. In this way, the VQE already relies on the techniques of conventional quantum chemistry for its use. Furthermore, in order to clarify the challenge for quantum advantage, as well as the expected scope and applicability of the VQE in the context of computational chemistry, we provide a very brief review of existing methods in this domain.\n",

      "Although exceptions exist, it should be noted that most conventional approaches for high accuracy ab initio ground- state energetic properties of molecular systems rely on wavefunction approximations, in keeping with the wavefunction approximation inherent in the VQE approach [168]. Other quantum variables (such as densities, density matrices, or Green's functions) can be used, but are in general unable to reach state-of-the-art accuracy for ground state energies [169]. As such, methods like DFT which is widely used in material sciences, and offers a competitive cost-accuracy trade-off for large systems are not direct competitors to VQE, due to the lack of systematic improvability of their results. Despite some quantum algorithms for electronic structure presenting algorithms with scalings competitive or even lower than DFT (for example, Ref. [170]), the most likely competitors for short to medium term applications of VQE are accurate wavefunction approaches, which can scale as high polynomial or even exponential, but which still are able to access comparatively large system sizes.\n",

      "Full configuration interaction (FCI) provides the benchmark for exact representation of a quantum state for a given Hamiltonian and basis set [81, 171]. This results in the approach being in most cases intractable, with practical limits for ab initio systems currently being 18 orbitals [172]. However, its numerically exact treatment of the correlated physics ensures that it occupies a unique and important position in quantum chemistry and electronic structure. FCI builds the variationally optimal wavefunction as a linear superposition of all possible configurations of electrons within the available degrees of freedom. Whilst the inclusion of all possible configurations ensures that the final result is invariant to the precise single-particle representation of the orbitals considered, it is common to perform FCI in a basis of Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals to improve the convergence rate. The Hartree-Fock method provides the variationally optimized single Slater determinant, as appropriate for closed-shell systems [107], approximating the ground state wavefunction at the mean-field level. In this basis, the orbitals have individual single-particle energies associated with them, since they diagonalize the single-particle Fock matrix. The structure of the FCI wavefunction then takes the following form, where the configurations can be classed by the number of particle-hole excitations they create in the reference Hartree-Fock configuration, as\n",

These number preserving excitations from the reference Hartree-Fock determinant can be extended to double excitations (second sum) all the way up to m-fold excitations, where m is the number of electrons. This then spans the full space of configurations, and due to the linear parameterization, ensures that the minimization of the Ritz functional (Eq. 1) can be written as a diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian in this basis [173, 174]. Exact excited states (within the defined basis and resulting Hamiltonian) can then also be computed as successively higher-lying eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix in this basis.\n",

      "While the FCI represents the 'ground truth' solution for the defined combination of Hamiltonian and basis set, the core aim of much of electronic structure is to truncate the complexity of this FCI solution (ideally to polynomial scaling with system size), while minimizing the loss in accuracy resulting from this truncation [81]. It is also advantageous to have the ability to systematically relax this truncation of the approximate ansatz, allowing for improvable results when the situation demands (for instance, see the methods described in Ref. [168]). To this end, a large number of approximate parameterizations of the FCI wavefunction have been explored, which differ in their accuracy, scaling, functional form, and method of optimization. Many of these approaches have enabled chemical accuracy and beyond compared the FCI result to be routinely reached in systems far larger than those accessible by FCI [175-180]. The technical definition of chemical accuracy is specifically the accuracy required to compute accurate enthalpies (heats) of reactions, which numerically corresponds to a method achieving an output within 1.6 milli-Hartree (mEH) [181] of experimental results. It is widely used as a benchmark for numerical methods, although it is worth noting that other chemical properties need higher accuracy (sometimes by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude for instance in the case of spectroscopic properties). It is in general considered extremely difficult (or impossible) to reach for large systems due to the approximations which are made when constructing the model. Oftentimes computational methods aim at a correct qualitative description of the chemical properties instead. We refer to chemical precision as the benchmark for the precision at which the model is solved, irrelevant of the uncertainties and approximation made when constructing the model (see Ref. [83] for a thorough discussion of chemical accuracy vs. precision in the context of computational chemistry).\n",

It results in more efficient approaches than FCI which can access larger system sizes, with only small tradeoffs in accuracy. As an illustration of the capabilities of state-of-the-art methods, a recent study presents a blind test comparison of nine different methods applied to benzene on an active space of 30 electrons and 108 molecular orbitals [168]. The root mean square deviation between the results produced by these methods was only 1.3mEn, demonstrating a consistent and reliable level of accuracy between these methods, expected to be close to FCI accuracy. A similar (albeit not blind) study was conducted in Ref. [169], with applications to transition metal systems, again showing excellent agreement between the most accurate wavefunction methodologies in these systems.\n",

      "To rationalize some of these parameterizations, an obvious first approximation to Eq. (5) can be made via truncation in the total number of excitations from the reference configuration, allowing retention of the efficient linear form. The most common of these is the configuration interaction with singles and doubles ansatz (CISD), where only up to double excitations are retained [81]. More recent adaptive, selective or stochastic inclusion of desired configurations exploit the sparsity in the optimized amplitudes, and can extend the ansatz further in accuracy, resulting in methods such as Adaptive Sampling CI (ASCI) [177, 182-184], Semistochastic Heat-Bath CI (SHCI) [88, 180, 185-189], or Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo [178, 190-193]. However, these truncated linear approximations can suffer from size-intensive total energies, where the energy does not scale appropriately with respect to the number of electrons, ensuring that the energy error per particle becomes increasingly large as systems grow in size [81]. Nevertheless, they can result in excellent variational approximations to FCI for small systems. An alternative approach is to construct a multi-linear approximation to the FCI wavefunction, which results in the matrix product state functional form.

More broadly, the development of tensor network theory [204, 205] and the use of matrix product states has resulted in significant improvements of methods for the resolution of lattice models (for instance [206, 207]). Finally, it is worth mentioning that a larger class of approximate wavefunction ansatz are able to be optimized within the framework of 'Variational Monte Carlo'. In these approaches, an approximate ansatz is chosen whose probability amplitude can be efficiently sampled at arbitrary electron configurations, but where a closed-form polynomial expression for the energy of the state is not accessible [208-210]. Within this criteria, the parameters of the ansatz can be optimized via Monte Carlo integration of the energy functional in a very general framework, albeit with the necessity of controlling for stochastic errors and care in optimization of the parameters.

      "Largely to correct for the size inconsistency in linear ansätze, the popular coupled-cluster ansatz truncates and then exponentiates the form of Eq. (5). This results in an appropriately sized consistent method, with an excellent accuracy vs. cost balance [211-213]. The coupled-cluster with single, double and perturbative triple excitations retained in the ansatz (known as CCSD(T)) is often referred to as the 'gold standard' of quantum chemistry where the correlations are not too strong [214], while other approximate coupled-cluster forms suitable for stronger correlation effects have also been developed (for recent examples, see Ref. [215, 216]). The coupled cluster is also the motivation of the use of the unitary coupled cluster ansatz of VQE [161], where a similar structure of exponentiated excitations based around a reference configuration is constructed (see Sec.6.2.2), with modifications to ensure efficient use on a unitary set of quantum circuits. Similar considerations of dynamic inclusion of additional excitations is also possible with the ADAPT-VQE ansatz [217] (Sec. 6.3.1). Furthermore, the Efficient Symmetry Preserving ansatz [218] looks to ensure the ability to systematically improve its span of the FCI description of Eq. (5) ensuring the preservation of symmetries inherent in its form. However, ensuring this systematic coverage of the FCI ansatz means that this form remains exponential in the system size in a number of realistic cases, meaning that true FCI may also be out of reach for the VQE.\n",

This understanding has promoted their effective use in appropriate circumstances, and stimulated further developments to improve their accuracy and scope. This analysis of the errors in different systems from VQE ansatz for quantum simulation, as well as the reasons underpinning or limiting their accuracy, is only starting to be performed, with more work necessary to fully classify and numerically investigate the approximations made in their form [161, 219].\n",

This constitutes a demanding target for VQE to meet, with many decades of research in this area. Furthermore, continuing research for other parameterizations suitable for conventional devices, such as the rapidly emerging field of machine-learning inspired ansätze [210, 220-226], will continue to push the boundaries of accuracy on conventional devices to challenge the criteria for VQE superiority.\n",

      "Due to the ground state being measured directly in binary form in QPE, the number of ancilla qubits required is directly related to the precision e targeted. Ancilla qubits provide one bit of information each, and as such, their number scales ((1/ log2(e)) in precision. The number of controlled unitaries is doubled for each ancilla qubit, and therefore scales O(1/6). These unitaries are effectively representing the action of the Hamiltonian on a state. The core component of QPE is therefore efficient Hamiltonian simulation (for an overview of relevant methods we recommend Ref. [47, 234]). Provided a non-restricted pool of qubits, Babbush et al. [235] show that by engineering the correct Hamiltonian representation (namely, a plane wave basis in first quantization, see Sec. 3), one can achieve sub-linear scaling in the number of basis elements for Hamiltonian simulation.\n",

      "As mentioned above, QPE is only as likely to succeed as the fidelity of the input state to the unknown target eigenstate approaches one. In turn, this implies that using a randomized state as input is not an option as its expected fidelity to the target eigenstate approaches zero exponentially in the system size, resulting in QPE becoming exponentially costly with imperfect input state preparation [232]. Numerous methods have indeed been proposed to prepare a good enough approximation of the target eigenstate in a tractable manner, often grounded in conventional quantum chemistry (for example[236-240]) or in adiabatic quantum computation (for example [231, 241, 242]).\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been a number of successful implementations of QPE on quantum devices [149, 243-248]. These have only been on small systems, as large scale implementations require quantum resources which are not currently available. In particular, large scale controlled unitaries, required for QPE, cannot be reliably implemented on NISQ devices. This is also the case for the inverse QFT. Several numerical studies have been performed to assess the complete cost of implementing QPE on relevant systems, and estimate runtime on a fault tolerant quantum computer. The problem of nitrogen fixation has become a de facto benchmark for this algorithm [249]. Reiher et al. [233] estimates that the 54 electrons, 108 spin orbitals of FeMo-co would require over ((1015) T gates, 200 millions qubits and would need to run for over a month to obtain quantitatively accurate results (assuming 100 ns gate times and error threshold of 10-3). Berry et al. rely on qubitization (a method which aims at transforming the evolution operator into a quantum walk) [250] to reduce the gate requirements to ((1011) Toffoli gates, despite an extended active space [251]. Lee et al. [252] further improve on these results and estimate they could perform this energy computation with four million physical qubits and under four days of runtime, with a similar ((10-3) error threshold. There have been many resource estimates performed for condensed matter models (for instance [253, 254]), with estimates as low as ~ 500, 000 physical qubits running for a few hours to solve a 100 site version of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Finally Elfving et al. [83] estimate that with similar error rates, the chromium dimer (Cr2) with an active space of 52 spin orbitals and 26 electrons, would require O(107) physical qubits running for about 110 hours. Research has progressed rapidly, and despite estimated runtimes and hardware requirements which remain daunting, offers a promising outlook for QPE, at least on targeted quantum chemistry tasks (examples of which are suggested in Ref. [83]).\n",

      "The VQE trades off the depth and number of qubits required under QPE with a higher number of measurements and repetitions of the circuit, as well as the constraints of an approximate ansatz for the state. As presented in Ref. [255], QPE requires ((1) repetitions with circuit depth scaling ((1/e) in precision €, VQE requires O(1/€2) shots with circuit depth scaling O(1) in precision. While many other factors affect the overall time scaling of both methods, this point illustrates the asymptotic efficiency of QPE compared to VQE assuming access to fault tolerant quantum computers, but also the resource efficiency of VQE over QPE for NISQ-era devices. The frontier between NISQ and fault tolerant quantum computation is blurry, and as pointed out by Wang et al. [255] so is the frontier between VQE and QPE. They present an interpolation between the two algorithms, labeled Accelerated VQE (or a-VQE), which uses smaller scale QPE calculations as sub-routines for the VQE. This method introduces a parameter a € [0, 1] which allows tuning of the circuit depth O(1/6ª) and number of samples ((1/62(1-a)) (one recovers the QPE scaling if a = 1, and the VQE scaling if a = 0). In general, rather than being mutually exclusive methods for solving an electronic structure problem, VQE and QPE are likely to provide the most benefit when combined as complementary approaches, offering algorithmic flexibility that can be adjusted depending on the progress of quantum hardware.\n",

      "In this section, we focus on combining compatible methods throughout the VQE pipeline, which offer the most promising scaling without compromising excessively on accuracy. The definition of a series of best practices for the VQE may suffer from many pitfalls since there remain many open research questions that affect the choice of optimal methods. It is also worth noting that it is likely that a method that is optimal for one system is not for another, and that this optimal compromise will change as quantum hardware improves. With this in mind, we provide some suggestions for best practices on current devices for two broad families of systems. In particular, we can distinguish between lattice models [42, 108, 110, 111] and ab initio molecular systems [81, 105-107]. These two categories usually require different encodings, measurement strategies, and ansätze. Table 1 summarizes the most promising VQE methods that we have identified, together with their scaling. The key distinctive factor separating ab initio molecular systems and lattice models is that the former makes no assumption on the range and type of interaction between the fermionic modes (beyond it being a two-body interaction), while the latter usually has a simplified and parameterized form which often only connects fermionic modes following a nearest-neighbor lattice structure and/or features a lower effective rank of interactions.\n",

      "Hamiltonian construction: In the case of an ab initio molecular system, the Hamiltonian representing its electronic energy landscape is initially defined by a series of atoms and the spatial coordinates of their nuclei (see Sec. 3). The first choice to make is the basis in which the Hamiltonian is expressed. This directly impacts the number of qubits required for the implementation of VQE, which is proportional to the number of basis functions. Since the number of qubits is a limited resource in NISQ, we recommend using a molecular orbital basis, as it is in general more compact for a given target accuracy (compared to, for example, atomic or plane wave bases). Once a basis is decided upon, we must choose whether the Hamiltonian is prepared in first quantization (antisymmetry maintained by the wavefunction) or second quantization (antisymmetry maintained by the operators, see Sec. 3). The number of qubits in first quantization scales as O(m log2(n)) [228, 278], with m the number of electrons and n the number of basis functions, against O(n) in second quantization [114]. The former also requires additional depth to enforce the antisymmetry of the wavefunction. There has not been, to the best of our knowledge, a rigorous study of the efficiency of using first quantization in VQE.\n",

      "While the scaling for first quantization could be advantageous in systems with few electrons and large basis sets (e.g. if a plane wave basis is used [235]), second quantization is generally preferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encoding: The next decision to take is that of the mapping used to transform the fermionic, second quantized Hamiltonian into a weighted sum of Pauli operators (see Sec. 4). The most relevant encodings for ab initio molecular system include Jordan-Wigner [114], the Parity [279], Bravyi-Kitaev [279-281], and ternary tree mappings [256] (all are explained in detail in Sec. 4.1). Out of these, the most promising encoding is the ternary tree mapping [256], since asymptotically it has the lowest Pauli weight (maximum number of non-identity Pauli operators in the string), resulting in lower circuit depth and possibly higher resilience to the barren plateau problem [87, 91]. It is however still unclear whether this lower circuit depth does indeed result in more noise resilience, as pointed out in Ref. [259]. We also recommend that the resulting qubit Hamiltonian is further reduced using tapering off methods based on symmetries [282-284] (see Sec. 4.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Measurement strategy: The large number of measurements required to sample the numerous terms in the Hamil- tonian is often cited as the most detrimental bottleneck of VQE [82, 83, 85]. Deciding on an efficient strategy for grouping and measuring Hamiltonian terms can go a long way in reducing this bottleneck. The decomposed interactions methods [119, 262] provide on balance the most promising means to jointly measure the Hamiltonian. They allow measuring an entire molecular Hamiltonian with O(N) groups (for more details about this method, see Sec. 5.2.4) and require additional circuit depth of O(N) to perform the necessary basis rotation, which is usually acceptable since this scaling is equivalent or better than for most ansätze. While it was shown that methods using grouping based on general commutativity of Pauli strings (e.g. [118, 285]) require fewer shots to achieve a given accuracy [262] in some numerical studies (in particular when using the Sorted Insertion heuristic [286]), this reduction will likely not be worth the additional circuit depth scaling O(N2) [117] required to perform the joint measurements. It is also worth noting that among the decomposed interactions methods, the Variance-estimate Greedy Full Rank Optimization [262] appears to perform best, although it requires minimization search of decomposition parameters. While this cost could be tractable there has been, to the best of our knowledge, no thorough research on how it would scale on large systems. For this reason, the Basis Rotation Group methods [119], which have a predictable cost, is a more cautious choice currently. For additional efficiencies and variance reduction, one can distribute shots according to the weights of each group in the Hamiltonian [82, 115, 116]. It is worth noting however that the O(N) scaling in number of groups is not an ideal proxy for the scaling in number of measurements required to achieve a given precision on observable estimation. This is due to possible covariances arising from the joint measurement of different operators [38]. Classical shadows [121] is also a promising method for reducing measurement count in VQE and has been shown in one study to have a better asymptotic scaling than decomposed interactions [268]. Further numerical studies will be required to establish the true performance of classical shadows compared to grouping methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ansatz: We now have to decide on an ansatz to model the electronic wavefunction on the qubit register. Deciding on an ansatz remains challenging because it is often unclear which is expressive and efficient enough to allow for a good approximation of the ground state. The ansatz with the best scaling, and some evidence for appropriate accuracy for the ground state representation [219], is the Unitary paired Generalized Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UpCCGSD) ansatz [80] (see Sec. 6 for a detailed description). This ansatz scales linearly with the number of qubit O(kN), but may require to be repeated k times to reach the desired accuracy. The scaling of required repetition of the ansatz k has been partially studied [80] but remains uncertain for large systems. This ansatz also has the advantage of only needing a fairly low number of parameters (O(kN2)). Adaptive ansätze (such as ADAPT-VQE [217], iterative Qubit Coupled Cluster [287] and Cluster VQE [288]) are also promising, as they may provide resilience against barren plateaus. Their main drawback is that these adaptative methods come at the cost of selecting an operator to grow the ansatz (or Hamiltonian) and the need to fully re-optimize the ansatz at each iteration. Numerical studies have suggested that additional measurements may be required compared to fixed structure ansätze [289], although further research is required to provide an exhaustive costs and benefits analysis.\n",

      "Optimizer: It is challenging to systematically compare different optimizers since no thorough large scale studies of their convergence rate have been conducted. For the time being, the Rotosolve optimizer [128, 129, 271] (see Sec. 7.4.2) has been shown to converge significantly faster than several gradient based optimizers [129]. It offers the advantage of not relying on any meta-parameters (such as a learning rate), which makes it a very easy optimizer to\n",

      "implement. However, Rotosolve presents two significant caveats: firstly, each iteration requires sampling three different values instead of two for most gradient based methods (one can avoid this overhead by finding one of the values from the optimization of the previous parameter, but this could result in correlated noise); secondly, parameters must be updated sequentially, thereby restricting the scope for parallelization of the VQE. The Fraxis method [272, 273] works in a similar manner and has been shown in some numerical studies to perform at least as good as Rotosolve or even outperform it. For the time being, given there are currently no optimizers that have been shown to have superior convergence rates, and given we do not expect that there will be a sufficient number of quantum computers to fully exploit the parallelization potential of the VQE in the NISQ era (see Sec. 2.7.2), we propose the Rotosolve / Fraxis optimizers over other alternatives (although it is worth noting that the Quantum Natural Gradient [130] has been shown to perform well and to benefit from resilience to barren plateaus [290, 291], albeit at a significant cost [130]).\n",
      "\n",
      "Scaling: Based on the discussion above, we can now construct a scaling estimate for a single iteration of the state- of-the-art VQE for ab initio molecular systems. The overall scaling is expressed in terms of the number of quantum gate time steps that must be performed (i.e. several gates applied on disjoint sets of qubits can be implemented within the same time step). The computation of the expectation value of a single operator at a precision e requires 0(1/€2) repetitions of the ansatz. In principle, e should aim for chemical precision, generally accepted as 1.6 mEH ~ 10-3EH. However, it is worth noting that, in practice gradients may become lower than chemical precision (due to the barren plateau problem for instance, described in Sec. 6.1). In this situation, estimating gradients may require a more precise € and more measurements, but it also means that optimization may rapidly become impossible. If the k-UpCCGSD ansatz is chosen, this scales as O(kN), while choosing to use the decomposed interactions of Sec. 5.2.4 requires O(N) different operators to be measured (and therefore a gate depth of O(N) for rotation to the joint measurement basis) resulting in a total scaling for a single estimation of the entire Hamiltonian of O(kN2 / €2).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are O(kN2) parameters in the k-UpCCGSD ansatz, hence this represents the cost scaling of updating each parameter using the Rotosolve optimizer. As this optimizer is not parallelizable, one may prefer to use a different method if sufficient sets of qubits are available. Overall, this gives us a total scaling for one iteration of the VQE of ((k2 N4 / €2) without parallelization, and O(kN) with full parallelization (the circuit depth). This perfect parallelization would require O(kN3 /62) sets of O(N) qubits. Note that while qubits within one set need to be entangled for the course of a single measurement, there is no requirement for entanglement between qubits of different sets of parallel quantum compute nodes. The sets of qubits can therefore be either all within on one quantum computer, or else also distributed across different separated quantum computers (see Sec. 2.7.2). It should be noted that the precision e is generally required to achieve chemical precision. However, if a barren plateau occurs, e may need to be reduced by orders of magnitude to compute gradients accurately enough to achieve a satisfactory optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far we have only considered the scaling of one iteration. It is still an open research question how the number of iterations required to achieve convergence scales with system size for the VQE. This depends on numerous factors, including the ansatz, the optimizer used, and the system studied. One important point to note is that convergence tends to be rapid at the beginning of the optimization process, with large gradients that require only a low number of shots to be computed accurately enough to progress. It becomes more challenging close to the optimum, where gradients are smaller, requiring a larger number of shots to continue the optimization. As such the last few iterations of the VQE are likely orders of magnitude more expensive than the rest of the optimization, if the algorithm is implemented efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other overheads that may be worth consideration in the initial setup of the system Hamiltonian. The computation of the Hamiltonian matrix elements generally has a polynomial scaling, while naive implementations of Hartree-Fock scale O(n4) [292], with n the number of basis functions, and it can be reasonably assumed that n = N for ab initio molecular systems. Similarly, applying a decomposed interactions method to diagonalize operators and reduce measurements requires rewriting the Hamiltonian in a different basis [119, 262]. However, these costs only occur once at the beginning of the VQE process, and are unlikely to be a bottleneck. Despite possibly higher scaling than that of a VQE iteration, they are likely to have a significantly lower pre-factor (as implemented on conventional hardware), and as such are not likely to constrain the application of the algorithm except far in the asymptotic realm. However, less investigated is that these joint measurement bases may result in covariance between measurements of different Hamiltonian terms, thereby requiring additional measurements [38, 119, 262, 286] which could significantly affect overall cost for the VQE.\n",

      "Our suggestions for lattice models differ from their ab initio counterparts. Lattice models for the most part only include terms in the Hamiltonian between nearest-neighbors on their respective lattice, with interactions between more distant sites significantly truncated in range. In particular, this limited degree of connectivity of lattice models provides the option to construct mappings with much lower Pauli weight, enabling more compact ansätze to be efficient, though this can come at the cost of additional qubits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamiltonian construction: In the case of a lattice model, the Hamiltonian is given as a small number of empirical parameters, requiring no prior computation of matrix elements. These models are generally most naturally and efficiently expressed in terms of fermionic operators in the site representation, where the locality of the interaction can be exploited to reduce the number of measurements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encoding: There is significant literature on the fermion-to-spin mapping for lattice models (see Sec. 4.2 for further details). These mappings are in general designed to minimize the required Pauli weight of the operators for a given lattice structure. The most important property of a lattice is the maximum degree of connectivity (coordination) of the sites, denoted d. For instance, a square lattice has d = 4, and an equivalent hypercubic lattice of dimension D has d = 2D. If one is limited by the number of qubits available, the most appropriate mapping for a lattice is an adaptation of the Bravyi-Kitaev mapping (based on Fenwick trees) [293], and which has a Pauli weight scaling as O(log(v)), where v is the minimum number of sites in any one dimension for a D = 2 lattice. It has the advantage of reducing the Pauli weight of the operators produced, compared to a naive implementation of Bravyi-Kitaev on a lattice, while maintaining the number of qubits required equal to the number of sites, n. If however the number of qubits is not a hard constraint, the Generalized Superfast Encoding method [257] provides a lower Pauli weight scaling of O(log2(d)) at the cost of requiring an increased number of qubits for each site, with an overall scaling of O(nd /2) qubits. The Compact encoding [260, 261] requires a lower number of qubits (~ 1.5n), but has not yet been generalized for regular lattices of more than three dimensions. Beyond their relationship to the resilience to barren plateaus in the optimization [87, 91, 258], the relevance of the Pauli weight in the context of VQE is also in how it affects the choice of ansatz, and in particular whether the ansatz is initially expressed in terms of fermionic operators. If the chosen ansatz is not dependent on fermionic terms, then Bravyi-Kiteav or Jordan-Wigner mappings are preferred. Furthermore, the number of qubits required to represent the Hamiltonian can be reduced using the tapering off methods based on symmetries as described in Sec. 4.3 [282, 283].\n",

For example, for a hypercubic lattice of dimension D, the number of edges, and therefore, the number of operators will scale O(nD) (though it is worth noting that the pre-factor to this scaling may change significantly depending on the encoding used), as detailed in Sec. 4.2. Because it is in general possible to reach low Pauli-weight encodings for lattice models (see Sec. 4.2), qubit-wise commutativity (QWC) grouping [38, 115, 117, 118, 157, 263-267] could possibly offer significant potential for reductions in the number of terms. It is also worth considering the fact that ansätze for lattice models tend to be shallower, and as such, the cost of basis rotations in methods based on general commutativity of Pauli operators could be too significant to justify its use. As such we would therefore recommend QWC grouping until further research is conducted.\n",

      "Ansatz: Direct application of ansätze suited for ab initio molecular systems (such as Unitary Coupled Cluster, UCCSD and its extensions) have been shown to work in practice using generalized encodings such as Jordan-Wigner (see for instance, Ref. [294]). However, we note that the underlying physics motivating the ansatz is not ideally suited to strongly correlated lattice models, requiring care to ensure that they are efficient ansatz for these systems [161]. Since these ansätze are formulated in a basis of Hartree-Fock or other mean-field orbitals, they do not allow using some of the low-weight encodings easily and do not enable exploitation of the low degree of connectivity of the model. Instead, one ansatz that has been shown to be very suitable for correlated lattice problems is the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA) [82, 150] (see Sec. 6.2.4). The ansatz leverages the more compact structure of the lattice model Hamiltonian and is built using fermionic operators, thereby making the most of low Pauli weight lattice encodings [257, 260, 261, 295]. HVA was also shown in [150] to be particularly resilient to the appearance of barren plateaus in the optimization problem. The ansatz has a depth and number of parameters scaling with the number of commutative Pauli groups in the Hamiltonian (though it may need to be repeated several times to account for lower expressibility compared\n",

For instance, Fourier Transform-HVA [235] could be very efficient on certain models (in particular jellium in Ref. [235], which is a continuous model, but with the Hamiltonian defined by a single parameter). Symmetry breaking HVAs [296, 297] are also a promising avenue, and though numerical tests from Ref. [297] show excellent fidelities of the state produced, results in Ref. [296] show some instabilities of the ansatz. Overall, until further research is conducted, we consider that HVA is safest and most general option for lattice models. Finally, we have neglected consideration of adaptive ansätze, as it is difficult to make a scaling argument for their efficiency in this domain, where the ability to justify the inclusion of some terms over others in the ansatz is likely to be diminished.\n",

      "Scaling: Based on the above, we can make an argument for the scaling of VQE as implemented for lattice models. The number of shots required to achieve a precision of e when computing an expectation value scales O(1/2), with e the target precision. For lattice models however, the target is usually not chemical accuracy and instead depends on the aim of the calculation. Generally, the aim is to resolve some correlated features of the electronic structure (e.g. predicting the parameter regimes for different phases, or response properties Ref. [298-301]). The HVA ansatz has a scaling capped by the number of terms in the lattice model Hamiltonian and the number of repetitions of the ansatz k, hence O(knD). However, there may be a few caveats to this. Since some encodings require additional qubits to reduce the Pauli weight, they would increase the depth and the number of terms in the ansatz, while at the same time reducing the depth per term of the ansatz due to the reduced Pauli weight. Overall these two effects are likely to only affect the pre-factor of the VQE, noting that we consider this an area of open research. Therefore, we maintain the previous scaling and estimate that a single energy evaluation would scale O(k(nD/e)2).\n",

      "For a regular hypercubic lattice with only at most nearest-neighbor terms in the Hamiltonian, there are O(knD) parameters in the HVA, bringing the total scaling of computing gradients for a lattice model VQE to O((knD)3 /(€)2). As noted previously, if the full parallelization potential is exploited, this would give a scaling of O(knD) for one iteration of the VQE. Discussions regarding the number of iteration are identical to the considerations raised in the previous section. It is worth noting that there has been so far no evidence that qubit-wise commutativity grouping can reduce the overall scaling of the number of operators to measure, and therefore we have not included it in this scaling analysis. Similarly, while the depth of HVA scales with the number of commutative groups in the Hamiltonian, we have not yet found an argument on whether this would reduce scaling below that of the number of terms O(nD).\n",

They also possibly unveiled the existence of the barren plateau problem ahead of it being characterized in Ref. [86], by numerically showing that more expressive forms of UCC cannot reach the same accuracy as less expressive forms on larger systems. They estimate that the total number of samples required to compute the ground state energy of Fe2S2 to chemical precision (using the STO-3G basis with n = 112 spin orbitals) is of the order O(1019), which is far beyond what could be considered tractable. Of course, conventional methods aiming at resolving exactly, and directly, the ground state of a n = 112 spin orbitals Hamiltonian would also be intractable (this would equate to finding the lowest eigenvalue of a 2112 matrix). However this does not exclude the possibility that more refined conventional methods, accepting some approximation, could an acceptable level of accuracy on Fe2S2 (as an example, please see Ref.

For instance, the runtime estimates of 1.9 to 71 days presented in [85] can be parallelized efficiently, although this would require a significant quantity of qubits arranged in sets on which parallel computation can be performed, possibly resulting in a variety of new problems such as overhead communication cost and additional quantum noise (see Sec. 2.7.2 for a discussion).\n",

      "It is very difficult to estimate the pre-factor of the VQE, which would very much be dependent on the hardware, and a detailed numerical analysis is not within the scope of this review. To estimate the depth we compile a 52 qubit version of k-UpCCGD assuming k = 1 and full connectivity of the qubit register. We find a depth of ~ 27, 000 timesteps, denoted L, and 170 parameters, denoted p (to illustrate the impact of the connectivity of the qubit register, we compiled the same ansatz assuming a linear qubit register, and find that the depth required is increased by more than tenfold). Note that choosing k = 1 is likely insufficient [80, 219]. Gate time is assumed to be T = 100 ns (similar to what is presented in [85], which itself refers to Table 1 in [303]), which is better than what can currently be achieved for superconducting qubits (~ 500 ns), but is probably achievable over the next few years. We assume readout and reset times are negligible compared to the circuit runtime. The pre-factor for the number of operators (P) to measure can easily be assumed to be 16 as each fermionic operator result in two Pauli strings under generalized mappings, and there are four fermionic operators in each two-body term in the Hamiltonian. Using a form of decomposed interactions we estimate that the number of operators is ~ 16N = 832 (we do not consider the impact of covariances may have on the noise of the estimates, though point out that 16 is a conservative pre-factor), and assume that the required circuit depth for basis rotation is negligible. Finally, we set the target precision e to 10-3 mEH, which is close to chemical precision (1.6 mEH) [181] and roughly assume that S = 1/62 = 1,000, 000 shots are used for the estimation. A much lower number of shots would be sufficient to progress the initial part of the optimization, and this high number of shots is only required in the last iterations of a VQE close to convergence to reach chemical precision (note however that this number of shots may need to be much higher in case of barren plateaus). It is therefore likely that the last few iterations before convergence are the most costly and time-consuming, largely dominating the cost. However, despite some optimistic assumptions listed above, it is clear that the time cost of VQE implemented on a single set of qubits remains orders of magnitude too large to be realistically viable, pointing to the dependence of the method on parallelization.\n",

First, as it is the case for conventional parallel computing, parallel quantum computing will suffer from communication overheads. These overheads are the computational cost of coordinating the parallel tasks, which can include the likes of synchronization cost, data aggregation and communication (possibly latency if the different sets of qubits are connected through the cloud). Second, parallelization could result in higher noise levels. We note two possible sources of additional noise: (1) if parallelization is done on multi-threaded quantum computers, there is higher chance of cross-talk between qubits; (2) variational algorithms are considered to be somewhat noise resilient as they can learn the systematic biases of a given hardware [38, 94] - if the algorithm is run on multiple quantum computers these noise resilient effects may disappear, as systematic biases on one set of qubits, which differs on another, may no longer be learned through the variational process.\n",

Given the number of qubits required scales as a function of the number of basis functions (see Sec. 4), choosing a basis that is compact, but yet provides an accurate description of the system studied, is critical for an efficient implementation of VQE. Basis elements, functions or orbitals describe the probability distribution of a single electron. For ab initio systems, these have primarily been built from parameterized atom-centered Gaussian ('atomic') orbitals, with the majority of research to date in VQE using minimal sized Stater Type Orbitals (STO) (for example [37, 80, 263]). These basis functions are defined as a weighted sum of Gaussian functions to provide approximately the right radial distribution, long-range behaviour, and nuclear cusp conditions for each atom [307, 308]. As an illustration, the radial component of the minimal STO-3G basis for each atom is constructed from three Gaussians such that an atomic orbital is given by\n",

These basis sets are often called minimal basis sets as they only include orbitals necessary to represent the valence shell of an atom. For an appropriate treatment of the correlation, it is essential in real systems to enlarge the basis set to include higher energy atomic orbitals, allowing for additional polarization and diffuse functions, and higher angular momentum functions which are required to build in flexibility to describe the correlated positions of the electrons [53]. An example of these larger basis sets commonly used for correlated calculations are the correlation-consistent polarized Valence n-Zeta (cc-pVnZ) basis sets [309], which allow for a systematic (and extrapolatable) expansion in terms of the cardinal number of the basis set [310]. These basis sets have been used in some VQE research (for example [84, 159, 311]), but their additional size can limit the size of the systems treated. Alternative basis sets have been considered in the context of VQE. For example, plane wave basis have been used as a mean to construct a compact ansatz for certain models which naturally exploit the translational symmetry of certain models [235]. Alternatively, a grid of points in real space make a natural representation to enforce locality and enable a sparse representation of the Hamiltonian. However grid representations of these basis functions generally require a significantly larger qubit count, and therefore their use is limited in NISQ applications and for the VQE [98, 312-318].\n",

The Hamiltonian is then expressed within this molecular basis by way of a transformation of the matrix elements. Overwhelmingly, this transformation is obtained via a mean-field (generally Hartree-Fock) calculation, which produces this rotation to the molecular orbital basis, and additionally provide an energy measure for each single-particle molecular orbital (for a description of this, see Ref. [107]). However, given the constraints on qubit numbers and therefore the size of the single particle basis, there is also research in the use of further contractions of molecular orbitals to a more suitable and compact basis for subsequent correlated calculations. These are often based on approximate correlated treatments in order to truncate to frozen natural orbitals, which has been favorably suggested by Verma et al. [319], Mochizuki et al. [320] and showed to potentially resulting in computation cost reductions for VQE by Gonthier et al. [85].

In addition, following the Pauli exclusion principle, the electronic wavefunction must be antisymmetric, meaning that the exchange of any two electrons changes the sign of the wavefunction.

For instance, qubit state |¢1) = |00 ... 00) would represent function ¢1(x1), lø2> = |10 ... 00) would represent function ¢2(X2), and so on. Given m electrons in the wavefunction we are trying to model, and given each electron can occupy at most one basis function (represented by log2(n) qubits), one can model any product state with N = m log2(n) qubits. As discussed before however, in first quantization the antisymmetry is enforced directly through the wavefunction. Procedures have been developed to maintain this requirement using an ancilla qubit register of O(m log2(n)) qubits, and a circuit depth of O(logc(m) log2(log2(n))), where c ≥ 1 depends on a choice of sorting network [278].

This results in a sum of 2210g2(n) = n2 Pauli strings each acting on up to 2 log2(n) qubits (hence the Pauli weight in first quantization), for every operator in the Hamiltonian.

      "A few points are worth noting with respect to the use of first quantization for quantum computing. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, there are no publications studying the usage of this method within the context of VQE or any other NISQ algorithm. Secondly, it is very clear that while the ancilla qubits do not change the overall scaling of the method, it bears a significant cost for NISQ devices, in addition to having to compute all spatial integrals on the quantum computer [326]. Finally it is very important to note that in general first quantization can be advantageous on systems which require a very large number of basis functions compared to the number of electrons (due to the logarithmic scaling of the number of qubits in n). This is the case in particular when a plane wave basis is selected, as it usually requires several orders of magnitude more functions than the molecular basis to achieve equivalent accuracy [235] - plane wave basis in first quantization has been shown to bring significant scaling advantages for in fault tolerant quantum simulation of chemical systems [170]. Overall, despite offering clear promise for fault tolerant quantum computing, it appears for the moment that first quantization is on balance too costly for the NISQ era.\n",

      "Second quantization: Second quantization distinguishes itself from first quantization in that it enforces antisym- metry through the construction of its operators, rather than through the wavefunction. As such, the operators used to construct the Hamiltonian must abide by certain properties. The action of the operators must also allow moving a particle from one basis function to another (e.g. from an occupied orbital to a virtual orbital). In particular, while in first quantization this action (e.g. |ø\")> <¢a)|) straightforwardly acts as moving an electron, operators in second quantization additionally need to verify antisymmetric properties.

Firstly, low-weight encodings result in lower depth ansätze and lower circuit construction costs [293, 338, 339]. This is in part because a few operators that act locally on different qubit subsets can be implemented in parallel, in other parts because operators acting on local qubit subsets require fewer entangling gates than non-local qubit subsets. Secondly, it has been shown that using low-weight operators as observable in the VQE cost function provides some resilience against the barren plateau problem [87] (see Sec. 6.1). Finally, the lower the Pauli weight, the lower is the overall probability of readout error. This is obvious, as identity operators do not need to be measured, and as such the probability of measurement error increases with the Pauli weight [119].\n",

      "In this section, we are concerned with encodings that map the entire Fock space in which the Hamiltonian is expressed. As such, the number of qubits N required from these encodings is in principle equal to the number of spin orbitals n in the Hamiltonian considered (without taking into consideration possible use of symmetries to reduce the number of qubits required, as presented in Sec. 4.3). These encodings are the most general, in that they are not tailored for specific Hamiltonian structures. They are agnostic to the degree of connectivity of the Hamiltonian graph (the maximum number of fermionic operators linking one spin orbital to another) and are in general better suited for ab initio molecular systems than to lattice models. One recurrent issue related to these encodings is the fact that they transform one and two-body fermionic operators which are local (act only on up to four spin orbitals at the time) into Pauli strings which are in general non-local and therefore have either high Pauli weight or Pauli weight that scales with the number of spin orbitals in the system. It also means that high connectivity on the qubit lattice may be required to efficiently implement fermionic operator based ansätze without relying on a large number of entangling gates. A summarized comparison of these mappings is presented in Table 4.\n",

      "The direct consequence of adding the Z strings is that the Pauli weight of Jordan-Wigner mapping scales O(N). This makes the mapping relatively costly with regards to the number of entangling gates required to simulate fermionic based ansätze. However, it is worth noting that some ansätze include spin operator level parameters [344]. This allows the VQE to variationally learn the anti-commuting relationship and therefore allows forgoing the Z strings at the cost of additional circuit parameters. This approach caps the Pauli weights of the Jordan-Wigner mapping to four (one for each fermionic operator in two-body terms) and significantly reduces the number of entangling gates required.\n",

      "Another feature of the Jordan-Wigner mapping that is worth discussing is the number of Pauli strings produced. From Eq. (45), it is clear that each fermionic operator results in two Pauli strings. As such, the number of Pauli strings scales at the same rate as the number of fermionic operators in the system considered. For a second quantized Hamiltonian, the number of fermionic operators scales with the number of two-body fermionic terms, or O(n4), and therefore, the number of strings in the Jordan-Wigner mapping would scale O(N4). The Jordan-Wigner mapping is by design applicable only to qubits, encoded from SU(2) fermions. However a generalized form of Jordan-Wigner, applicable to SU(N) fermions was proposed by Consiglio et al. [345].\n",

Because the method presented in Ref. [282] and Ref. [283] addresses these symmetries without significant additional gate cost (see Sec. 4.3), it is in general preferred. We nonetheless encourage readers interested in going deeper in the knowledge of these general encodings to go through Ref. [337] as it discusses the relevant theory in depth.\n",

      "The key metric for comparing the four mappings presented above is their Pauli weight: while Jordan-Wigner and Parity scale O(N), Bravyi-Kitaev scales O(log2(N)) and the optimal ternary tree encoding scales O(log3(2N)) (which is asymptotically the better one). The number of qubits is the same across all these mappings and equates to the number of fermionic modes (N = n). These mappings can also benefit from the same amount of qubit reduction using symmetries (see Sec. 4.3). While the number of operators may vary, it has also been shown numerically that in general applying grouping strategies (presented in Sec. 5) to these operators results in a very similar number of total operators to measure [118].\n",

      "Because the Bravyi-Kitaev and optimal ternary tree mappings have lower Pauli weight, they are in theory less subject to read-out errors. However, this becomes invalid once the grouping of the Pauli operators for joint measurements is introduced. This is because, for most groups, the entire register of qubits needs to be measured in the Z basis. The main advantage of the log2(N) or log3(Nn) Pauli weight is in using the mapping to construct an ansatz based on fermionic operators (such as the Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz, UCC, see Sec. 6.2.2). Numerical studies looking at the use of Bravyi-Kitaev mapping in the context of Quantum Phase Estimation have consistently shown that it results in a significant reduction in the number of entangling gates required [281, 295, 340], without impacting the overall accuracy of the result in noiseless simulations. It is clear these results also translate to applications of the UCC ansatz in the context of the VQE and are likely to extend to the optimal ternary tree mapping. It is important to note that the relative impact of low Pauli weight is very much dependent on the degree of connectivity of the qubit register, and limited connectivity (e.g. qubits placed in a line), could result in a significant increase in the number of entangling gates required in a low Pauli weight encoding.\n",
      "\n",
      "A final point to note is that a recent study [259] numerically tested that UCC ansatz constructed for VQE with the Bravyi-Kitaev mapping could result in slightly higher sensitivity to quantum noise channels (see Appendix C.1) than the Jordan-Wigner mapping, despite lower gate depth. Sawaya et al.[259] conjecture that this could be because occupation numbers are stored locally in the Jordan-Wigner mapping: a single qubit error only impacts the result of one orbital, while for the Bravyi-Kitaev mapping, it could affect several. This also implies that occupation number errors create greater errors in the energy than parity errors [259]. One could expect the parity and ternary tree mappings to be affected by the same phenomenon, although we are aware of any further research on this topic.\n",

      "The mappings defined above are oftentimes inefficient for lattice models. This is because they assume full connectivity between the different fermionic modes, and translating this into spin-operators results in non-local operations. Instead, the mappings presented in this section are concerned about being as efficient as possible for a given lattice model, where fermionic modes are attached to a specific geometry. The earliest explicit definition of fermion to qubit mapping was indeed an application to the Hubbard model [228]. The literature is divided into two mains approaches for doing so: auxiliary fermion schemes [354, 355] and Loop-Stabilized Bravyi-Kitaev (LSBK), also known as Superfast Encoding (SFE) [280]. Maintaining low Pauli weights comes at a cost of additional qubits for all the methods mentioned in this section.

Of course, any lattice models (or ab initio molecular system) can be represented as a graph, where each fermionic mode is a vertex, and each interaction with another fermionic mode is a weighted edge in the graph. Unlike the mappings presented so far, in this mapping, qubits are used to encode interactions between fermionic modes rather than the state of the fermionic modes themselves. It is referred to in the literature as the Superfast Bravyi-Kitaev (SFBK) or alternatively, Loop-Stabilized Bravyi-Kitaev (LSBK) [293] (we use SFBK as it is more generally used in the literature).\n",

This makes Superfast Encoding more suitable for lattice based models.

[260] offer the most advantageous combination of low number of qubits and low Pauli weights for systems of dimensions up to 3. Extension of the compact encoding to higher dimensions requires further research. In the meantime, the GSE [257] provides the best performance in terms of Pauli weight but does require that the number of qubits increases linearly with the degree d of the graph (recalling d = 2D) and the number of sites n.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we found no comprehensive studies on the matter, these would very likely result in the most compact ansatz. However, as noted in [259] when comparing the Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev mappings, lower gate depth does not necessarily translate to an overall higher resilience to quantum noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "An overall question that remains pending regarding all the lattice mappings considered is their efficacy at realizing error mitigation or error correction. For example, while the GSE demonstrates some error correcting properties, it is still unclear what quantum noise threshold is tolerable for these properties to be useful. In particular, such assessment is required to fully compare these encoding like-for-like. For example, the compact encoding could require additional quantum resources from error mitigation techniques (see Sec. 8) to achieve an accuracy comparable to what can be achieved when relying on the error correcting properties of other mappings such as SFBK or GSE.\n",
      "\n",
      "This point also extends to applications of methods to ab initio molecular systems. Ref. [295] shows that SFBK results in lower gate depth than Jordan-Wigner, but higher than Bravyi-Kitaev on a small molecular system. Chien et al. [363] also show that Jordan-Wigner can outperform SFBK in terms of gate count under certain conditions on the Hamiltonian studied. One can expect GSE to perform better due to its lower Pauli weight, however for a relevant comparison, one would need to incorporate equivalent error mitigation techniques into Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev to balance quantum resources required to achieve a given accuracy. Overall, the question of the real impact of the error mitigating and correcting properties of lattice tailored encodings could be critical in determining their future applicability.\n",

      "Several methods have focused on reducing the overall number of qubits required to encode a specific Hamiltonian [282-284, 336, 337]. These methods usually come at limited additional costs and can therefore be used to significantly improve the efficiency of VQE. Bravyi et al. [282]] formulate several proposals designed to reduce ('taper off') the number of qubits required to simulate fermionic systems for variational quantum algorithms. In particular, they find that it is possible to reduce qubit requirements in encodings where Z2 symmetries are present. This results in halving the dimension of the Hilbert space of the system considered for each qubit removed. The starting point of the proposal in Ref. [282] is the observation that in some encodings, some qubits are representing a conserved quantity of the molecular system, and should therefore never change. One example is the last qubit in the parity mapping which encodes the parity of the entire wavefunction and is directly dependent on the electron number.\n",

      "By definition, a symmetry is an operator which leaves the Hamiltonian invariant when acting on it (i.e. it must commute with the Hamiltonian) [364]. Hence one can always find a common eigenbasis for the operator corresponding to the symmetry and the Hamiltonian. As the qubit Hamiltonian is written as a weighted sum of Pauli strings, if all Pauli strings commute with an operator, it is a symmetry operator. As such, given any initial encoding, one can find a certain number of operators, the symmetry operators Ti, that commute with each of the Pauli strings in the Hamiltonian and between themselves. This can be done by finding the kernel of the check matrix that corresponds to the Pauli terms [282]. Although only symmetries that can be expressed as tensor products of Pauli operators can be found by this procedure. We can then define a change of basis, represented by a unitary operator U such that for each symmetry Ti we have\n",

Setia et al [283] show that symmetry operators can be identified using molecular point group symmetries [365] for the case of quantum chemistry simulations. One can remove the qubits corresponding to each member of an Abelian (commutative) subgroup of the molecular point group describing the symmetries of the molecule under consideration. It is shown in Ref. [283] that the number of qubits that can be removed is either higher or the same as the method proposed in Ref. [282]. For instance, CO2 on 30 qubits, C2H2 on 24 qubits, BeH2 on 14 qubits, can all be reduced by 5 qubits using the method presented in Ref. [283]. It is worth noting that a similar approach is briefly outlined in [366], along with a proposed method to identify point-group symmetries.\n",

A set of Pauli strings observables is considered non-contextual if it is possible to measure and assign value to them simultaneously without contradiction [284, 367-373]. While this technique can introduce an approximation in the energy computed, it does so with a significant reduction in the number of qubits, and can also be applied after using the qubit reduction technique presented above for further efficiency gains[284].\n",

      "One of the key challenges possibly holding back the VQE is the very large amount of samples that are required to accurately compute the relevant values of the algorithm. There are two main aspects to manage for efficiently sampling these expectation values: the number of terms in the Hamiltonian cost functions (computed using the mappings presented in Sec. 4), and the number of shots required to sample an expectation value at a certain level of accuracy. It is worth noting that the level of accuracy required changes throughout the optimization process. This could be because of the accuracy needed for computation of the final output of the VQE, but also most importantly because optimizer gradients (or optimizer steps in gradient-free methods) must be estimated precisely enough to be distinguished from one another when the optimization landscape flattens. An extreme case of the latter is the barren plateau problem ([86], see Sec. 6.1). We first discuss strategies for optimal sampling error reduction (Sec. 5.1), and then we discuss methods used to reduce the number of Pauli strings that are necessary to separately measure (Sec. 5.2).\n",

This means that the number of times an experiment needs to be repeated to achieve a given expected error e goes as O(1/62).

When results obtained numerically are within this level of precision to experimental results, the simulations is deemed to reach chemical accuracy. This metric can be used as a bound for target precision in the VQE context (for an excellent discussion of precision vs. accuracy in this context, we direct readers to Eflving et al. [83]). One should be cautious however not to assume too much of a relationship between this number and the number of shots required to perform VQE. That is because the key bottleneck of VQE optimization is not the estimation of the wavefunction itself but the estimation of gradients and in particular the difference between these gradients (which allow for the optimization step to be performed reliably). This difference may be orders of magnitude smaller than the chemical precision threshold in a barren plateau, requiring that many more measurements ([86], see Sec. 6.1). While polynomial in scaling, it has been pointed out on several occasions that the number of shots required to accurately compute a VQE optimization process rapidly becomes unmanageable [82, 83, 85], suggesting the method might be unable to compete with its conventional computing counterparts [83]. Ref. [82] estimates (though conservatively) that simulating the energy of Fe2S2 ferredoxin (in STO-3G basis with N = 112 spin-orbitals) using a VQE would require a total of O(1019) shots based on the upper bound defined in Eq.

The classical shadow is beneficial if it can be constructed with a tractable number of measurements and such that ELf(p)] = f(p), with f any of the aforementioned functions.

This implies that single measurement values for all the terms in a given Abelian group can be inferred from a single joint measurement (a measurement that simultaneously assesses multiple Pauli operators) of the complete qubit register. This principle derives from the stabilizer theory (for a review of stabilizer theory, we recommend: Refs. [76, 407]). First, we need to identify a set of generators of the Abelian group, { 1} }.

It also provides a large improvement in the noise resilience of mappings with high Pauli weight such as Jordan-Wigner (See Sec. 4).

This covariance effects increase the sampling noise and as such the total number of measurements required at a given level of precision. Joint measurements under the Unitary grouping or the decomposed interaction methods suffer from the same issue [262]. Therefore, the total number of measurements required to achieve a given precision should be taken into consideration as figure of merit for a grouping strategy [286]. Another cost to consider is the additional quantum noise resulting from the circuit used to rotate the measurement basis which could be significant in both the case of Unitary grouping and GC grouping. Further resources may be required to mitigate these additional errors (Sec. 8). Finally, an important point to note is that the scaling of most grouping heuristics could end up being somewhat prohibitive (for instance, we recall that LDFC scales O(N8)) for large systems. A possible way to dampen this issue is to use grouping methods which can be re-used across different Hamiltonians of the same active space sizes, by applying heuristics at the fermionic operator level [117], or by relying on two-body reduced density matrices [159].\n",

      "Inference methods could perform better for each of the costs listed above but could also face their own pitfalls, in particular when an additional machine learning model requires training. A thorough numerical analysis of the multiple methods that have been proposed would be an interesting avenue for future research. In the meantime, we consider that the decomposed interactions [119, 262] methods have the most supporting arguments for the treatment of molecular Hamiltonians. While it is shown numerically in Ref. [262] that GC with Sorted Insertion [286] tends to be most efficient with respect to the number of measurements required to achieve a given level of precision, decomposed interactions methods perform almost at the same level (and it appears that the gap in performance narrows as the system increases in size [262]), and requires significantly less depth to perform the required unitary transformations (O(N) against O(N2) for GC). It is worth noting that the basis rotation group method [119] currently has a much more predictable implementation cost than FRO and its extensions. The latter requires solving a minimization problem to perform the decomposition, which could come at a significant computational cost or loss in accuracy, though further research will be required to investigate this point.\n",

      "Ansatz selection is a central part of the VQE pipeline. The right choice of ansatz is critical to obtain a final solution that is close to the true state of interest. To achieve this, it is essential to maximize the span of the ansatz in parts of the Hilbert space that contain the solution (i.e., a state that is sufficiently close to the desired state which globally minimizes the expectation value of the Hamiltonian). The span of possible states an ansatz can reach is referred to as its expressibility. However, performing a variational optimization on an ansatz with high expressibility could easily become intractable due to the number of parameters required to allow reaching many these different states, the number of iterations required for convergence, or the number of shots required to achieve sufficient gradient accuracy to continue the optimization. Whether an ansatz can be optimized in a tractable manner is referred to as its trainability. In practice, it is better to choose an ansatz spanning a smaller subspace, but remaining trainable. Designing an efficient ansatz for a given number of qubits hence involves finding an optimal trade-off between expressibility and trainability.\n",

      "Expressibility: The expressibility of an ansatz describes its span across the unitary space of accessible states [122, 123, 438]. One can quantify the expressibility of an ansatz by assessing the distance between the distributions of the unitaries that can be generated by the ansatz, and the uniform distribution of unitaries in the corresponding Hilbert space [438], also known as the Haar measure. A given ansatz is called a t-design if it is indistinguishable from the Haar measure up to the tth moment. A 2-design ansatz can produce any possible state in the Hilbert space considered, from any input state: it is maximally expressive. As a side note, Hubregtsen et al. [439] also study the relationship between the expressibility of quantum neural networks and their accuracy in a classification task.\n",

Expressibility has also been shown to be a convenient metric for assessment of parametrized quantum circuits more generally [123]. In addition, several methods have been proposed to remove redundant parameters from quantum circuits without decreasing expressibility [440] or reducing the set of states that can be generated through the circuit [441].\n",

      "Trainability: The trainability of an ansatz refers to the ability to find the best set of parameters of the ansatz by (iteratively) optimizing the ansatz with respect to expectation values of the Hamiltonian in a tractable time [87, 122]. More specifically, an ansatz is considered trainable if its expected gradient vanishes at most polynomially as a function of the various metrics of the problem (e.g. system size, circuit depth). On the other hand, if the gradient vanishes exponentially, it is said to suffer from the barren plateau problem. In this section, we first provide a review of the barren plateau problem [86], which is the main known obstacle to ansatz trainability, and discuss its implication for the VQE in Sec. 6.1. We then describe of the most relevant fixed-structure ansatz for the VQE in Sec. 6.2, followed by a description of the most relevant adaptive structure ansatz in Sec. 6.3. Finally, we provide a discussion regarding ansatz selection for the VQE in Sec. 6.4. For alternative recent reviews of ansatz selection for the VQE, we recommend Refs. [103, 104].\n",

      "A key issue that is inherent to all types of variational quantum algorithms is the risk of vanishing gradients, either during training or as a result of a random initialization [86]. This refers to the risk of the cost function gradients vanishing exponentially as a function of specific properties of the optimization for a problem. McClean et al. [86] provide the first formal characterization of this barren plateau problem (some early numerical evidence of this problem are outlined in Ref. [82], without a characterization being provided), and show that cost function gradients are vanishing exponentially in the number of qubits in the quantum register when provided with random initialization of the circuit parameters. Even though this problem is akin to the vanishing gradient problem in machine learning, it has two striking differences that make it significantly more impactful on the prospects of variational quantum algorithms [86]:\n",

      "· The estimation of the gradients on a quantum device is essentially stochastic. Any observable can only be measured to a certain precision, increasing as the inverse square root of the number of shots (see Sec. 86). If gradients are exponentially approaching zero, it means that distinguishing between a positive and a negative gradient becomes increasingly difficult. Failing to establish the sign of the gradient reliably transforms the optimization into a random walk, overall requiring an exponential number of shots to continue optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "· The barren plateau problem is dependent on the number of qubits (while the problem is dependent on the number of layers for the vanishing gradient problem). Additional research also shows that it can be linked to other factors specific to quantum circuits, including expressibility of the ansatz [122], degree of entanglement of the wavefunction [89, 90], non-locality of the wavefunction [87, 91, 92], or quantum noise [442].\n",
      "\n",
      "Before describing key drivers of the barren plateau problem in more detail, and potential methods to address it, it is worth briefly discussing the typical cost function landscape for single parameters in the variational quantum eigensolver. Another problem that affects this landscape is that of 'narrow gorges' (initially characterized in [87]). It refers to the fact that the local minimum (well defined by the region starting from the end of a barren plateau and going towards a local minimum) contracts exponentially in the number of qubits. Interestingly, it was shown that these two problems are equivalent [443]. An alternative way to present the barren plateau problem is that it implies the expectation value of an observable with respect to a random state concentrates exponentially around the mean value of that observable [86], rendering intractable optimization away from the mean.\n",

This means that the probability of a gradient being above a certain threshold (which could be arbitrarily small), can always be upper-bound by a number that decreases exponentially in the system size N. It is however important to note that while defined with respect to a cost gradient, the barren plateau problem also affects gradient- free optimizers [89, 444] (e.g. COBYLA, Powel, Nelder-Mead, RotoSolver, see Sec. 7). It is easy to understand, as gradient-free optimizers usually rely on sampling the cost landscape of specific parameters. If the variance across the landscape is too small, then it becomes impossible to accurately progress through the optimization step.\n",

It is also worth noting that the best known scaling for a VQE ansatz is linear (e.g. k-UpCCGSD [80], Sec. 6.2.2, Fourier Transform-HVA [235] on some systems, Sec. 6.2.4). Uvarov et al.

First, the noise-induced barren plateau is independent of parameter initialization, or locality of the cost function, meaning that some of the strategies listed in Sec. 6.1.2 will not work in a noisy setting. Second, this bound is conceptually different from the previously described drivers of barren plateaus as it is a bound on the gradient, rather than on the variance of the gradient.

While showcasing promising results on small systems, the method is however quite challenging to implement in practice.

The model is trained to identify structures of parameters that best suit specific families of quantum circuit optimization problems, and is numerically shown to provide significant improvements. Similarly, Kulshrestha and Safro show that initializing ansatz parameters by picking them from a beta distribution reduces the impact of the barren plateau problem compared to picking them from a uniform distribution [448].

The ansatz can also be trained layer by layer to the same effect [450], though limitations of this method were shown in Ref. [451]. This is somewhat akin to adaptive ansätze (see Sec. 6.3), but generalized to any quantum neural network optimization. Patti et al. [90] also propose several additional mitigating methods including an alternative initialization strategy in which two qubit registers are initially not entangled, regularization on the entanglement, the addition of Langevin noise, or rotation into preferential cost function eigenbases. Sack et al. [403] showed that barren plateaus can be partially mitigated as part of a classical shadow measurement scheme. Wu et al. [452] propose to mitigate the impact of NIBP by defining an alternative cost function with the same optimal state but without sensitivity to vanishing gradients, by identifying and eliminating the dominant term in the Pauli representation of the observable measured. Finally, though not directly relevant to VQE, Pesah et al. [453] show numerically that Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks exhibit natural resilience to the barren plateau problem.

PNOs are an efficient basis for modeling of the most relevant virtual states for a given occupied orbital pair [485-488] initially developed for Coupled Electron-Pair Approximations, but subsequently used in CC [489, 490], and found to significantly reduce the size of of the virtual orbital space in CC calculations (for example [491]).

It is also possible to extend beyond excitations from a reference orbital to create a generalized version of the ansatz. The single excitation term then allows excitations from any PNO to any PNO.

      "Other UCC-based methods: Several other extensions of UCC are also worth mentioning briefly. The Unitary Cluster-Jastrow [503] ansatz uses Jastrow factors, traditionally used in Quantum Monte Carlo [504] to include the impact of cusps from the Coulomb potential in the wavefunction and adapted for CC theory in [505]. The method shows similar scaling to k-UpCCGSD and excellent results in numerical analysis [503]. It also does not require trotterization and thereby is less prone to errors due to operator ordering [219]). The multicomponent UCC [506] extends the UCC ansatz to systems that include coupling to bosonic statistic modes. It was also applied to photon number states to cover polaritonic chemistry [507]. Finally, the Low Depth Circuit Ansatz (LDCA) [508] is grounded in the Bogoliubov (or quasi-particle) CC [509-511], for which a unitary version was developed in Ref. [508]. While the Bogoliubov UCC can be implemented as an ansatz for VQE, Dallaire et al. [508] propose some additional transformations to exactly parametrize the ansatz in a linear depth circuit (but with quadratic parameter scaling). The parameter-efficient circuit training (PECT) optimizer proposer in Ref. [512], appears to provide an effective method to optimize LDCA on larger systems.\n",

      "Unitary Selective Coupled-Cluster Method: The USCC method, proposed by Fedorov et al. [513] could be categorized both as a UCC extension and as an adaptive ansatz. To implement this method, one starts with the reference Hartree-Fock state. From there, one and two body excitations (from occupied to unoccupied orbitals) which have corresponding Hamiltonian matrix elements above a given threshold T1 are included in the ansatz. A VQE is then performed on this ansatz until convergence - the first iteration of the method is complete. For the following iterations, the threshold is update such that: Ti = Ti-1/2, and new, higher order excitations are generated by applying one and two body excitations to those already included in the ansatz. The metric to compare to the threshold for inclusion of these excitations is obtained by multiplying the parameters obtained after optimization at the previous step with the Hamiltonian matrix element corresponding to the single or double excitation added. As per previous iterations, coefficients that are above the threshold are included in the ansatz and then optimized through VQE. The optimization continues until a convergence criteria is met or sufficient excitations have been included. Fedorov et al. [513] note that\n",

      "## UCC discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it is clear that there are several advantages of using UCC-type ansatz compared to HEA. First and foremost, the number of parameters in the former, ranging from O(N3) to O(kN2) (k an arbitrary constant) is significantly more advantageous than in the HEA which spans a much wider part of the Hilbert space. It was also shown numerically that the UCC ansatz can provide exact parametrization for an arbitrary electronic wavefunction [161], subject to certain conditions on optimization. The accuracy of the family of ansatz and its ability to approach FCI level results on a variety of small systems was numerically established in Ref. [483] (namely H2, H3, H4, NH, OH+, CH2, NH+). Similarly, Ref. [294] establishes that UCCSD outperforms conventional CCSD methods in accuracy on H4, H2O, N4 and on the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. It is further shown in the same study that orbital optimized methods (namely p-OO-UCCSD, OO-UCCD0 and OO-UCCD0-full) achieve results within 10 to 20 mH, showing a minor loss in accuracy compared to UCCSD, but a significant reduction in quantum resources required.\n",
      "\n",
      "A clear drawback of UCC-type ansätze is specifically that these are not hardware efficient. All UCC ansätze are designed in a manner that is agnostic to the connectivity of the device. The number of CNOT gates for each of the exponentiated Pauli strings required in the ansatz scales with its Pauli weight q (number of non-identity operators in the string) when full connectivity is allowed. Namely, each Pauli strings exponential requires 2(q - 1) CNOT gates [76]. Assuming double excitations are used, this implies a scaling of 0(2N4(q - 1)) CNOT gates (with q the average Pauli weight across all strings) if no further action is taken to make the ansatz more efficient (some of these gates can be canceled out at compilation). However, a significant overhead in the number of CNOT gates is required if connectivity is limited to bridge entanglement between qubits that are not directly connected on the device. Connectivity limitation of the qubit register can be addressed by introducing SWAP networks to effectively relocate qubits together when q- qubit operators need to be implemented on a non-local set of qubits [514]. This allows maintaining the depth scaling of UCC ansätze by parallelizing on a single qubit register several operators that would otherwise not commute, irrelevant of the degree of connectivity of the device. It does however come at the cost of additional SWAP (or CNOT) gates required to build the SWAP network compared to a fully connected device. This is also related to a similar drawback of UCC: while the scaling is advantageous, the ansatz generally requires a very large pre-factor in the number of gates [219, 297, 456]. A similar method to construct a more efficient gate fabric, but with the added benefit of preserving quantum number symmetry is found in Ref. [515].\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the UCC ansätze has a large pre-factor for the depth and number of entangling gates. As an example, Ref. [297] show that to achieve similar accuracy on a 12-qubit version of H2O, UCCSD requires 528 entangling gates, hence at the very best a depth of about 100 as one can fit at most 6 entangling gates in one time step, against 88 entangling gates for HEA, or a circuit depth of about 40 (In Ref. [297], Choquette et al. also present an ansatz which extends the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz presented in the following section, and which requires 108 CNOT gates for the same molecular model). It is fair to assume that k-UpCCGSD would perform significantly better than UCCSD in terms of depth. The Qubit-excitations [344, 455, 516], and qubit-operators [270, 287, 454] Coupled Cluster based ansatz (see Sec. 6.3), are a potential answer to address the scaling of CNOT gates while preserving some of the benefits of UCC ansätze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point worth mentioning about UCC-based ansätz is their dependence on operator ordering [219, 517]. Ordering of fermionic operators within the ansatz significantly impacts its accuracy, in particular for highly correlated electron wave functions (which is, as Grimsley et al. [219] and Wecker et al. [82] point out, the primary target of interest for quantum computers, as low correlation wave functions can easily be treated with conventional methods - see Sec. 2.4). This is particularly noticeable when dissociation limits are approached [219, 503], but can be in great part addressed by repeating the ansatz (i.e. setting k to a higher number for k-UpCCGSD). As pointed out in Ref. [80] and corroborated by results from Ref. [219], k-UpCCGSD does appear to be largely resilient to problems of operator order as long as one allows for k to be sufficiently high to provide the variational flexibility needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, another issue that can happen in both HEA and UCC ansatz is the appearance of 'kinks' in the Potential Energy Surface (PES). While already apparent in Ref. [263], these are very well characterized in Ref. [518]. These kinks are due to the energy ordering of the electronic states and lack of preservation of certain of symmetries (e.g. electron number, total spin) when building the ansatz, and can be addressed using symmetry preserving methods, including as an additional constraint placed in the VQE cost function [518] (see Sec. 7.5).\n",

These two-qubit gates aim at allowing relative phase changes between superpositions of |01) and |10) states, while leaving |00) and | 11) unchanged.

This means that layer repetitions is likely to be required to achieve the same level of expressibility, although exact scaling is not known. In Ref. [82], Wecker et al. suggest that the ansatz is trained layer-by-layer to facilitate optimization. The scaling in the number of entangling gates is similar to UCC based ansatz, as approximately the same number of operators are incorporated for each repeated layer.

It is clear that low Pauli-weight mapping (or lattice models) significantly improves the algorithm. The ansatz was also adapted to solve the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model on the Kagome lattice in Refs. [332, 333], both study showing promising results. In particular, Ref. [333] shows that VQE approaches the true ground of the lattice exponentially as a function of circuit depth on a noiseless simulation of up to 20 sites. Bosse and Montanaro [332] find a similar result ton a simulation of 24 sites, though point out to the large number of variational parameters needed. Another adaptation of HVA to the Heisenberg model, accompanied by a scaling study is presented in Ref. [524]. Finally, a version of HVA for Fermi-Hubbard is studied by Stanisic et al. [525], in which the ansatz is created by first applying a number of Givens rotations (rotation in a two dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space, which can be used as partial excitation exchanges between two qubits), allowing to efficiently prepare the ground state of the non-interacting Fermi-Hubbard model [526], then followed by time evolution following the same logic as HVA. The paper shows that through this ansatz construction, few parameters are needed to reproduce key qualitative features of strongly-correlated electronic systems.\n",

In this context, it was developed using a plane wave basis, allowing the one-body hamiltonian of jellium to be diagonal [235]. A slightly more general formulation is presented in Ref. [297]. The method relies on the fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) [526-528] which was initially constructed to diagonalize dynamics in many-body systems, and which has been shown to have a depth scaling of O(N) if implemented on a planar lattice of qubits [235].

      "The simplicity of the gradient computation at all iterations of ADAPT-VQE is key to its efficiency. However, assuming the case of a second-quantized electronic structure Hamiltonian (with O(N4) terms), and given there are O(N4) terms in a complete pool for up to double excitation operators, measurement scaling at each outer-loop iteration could naively reach O(N8). This can be reduced to O(N6) if one reformulates the energy gradients in terms of the three-body reduced density matrix [532]. This method also allow predicting gradients from the two-body reduced density matrix of the previous iteration of ADAPT-VQE, reducing overall scaling of measurements back to O(N4) albeit at a cost to accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, an important research question surrounding ADAPT-VQE is the optimal size of the operator pool, as it determines the number of iterations required, and the complexity of each step. It is also important to note that the scaling of the ADAPT-VQE pool can also be adjusted the same way it is adjusted in certain variations of the UCC ansatz. For instance, one could restrict operator availability to those available in k-UpCCGSD [80], or proceed to only integrate double excitation operator on the quantum computer subroutine akin to the OO-UCC ansatz [311]. Comparative performance of these respective approaches is yet to be assessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also contributing to the cost of ADAPT-VQE, a complete VQE convergence must be conducted between each incremental step. While this is largely tractable for early steps, as the ansatz remains shallow, it could rapidly become prohibitively expensive to implement. Grimsley et al. [533] nonetheless showed that the build-in \"recycling\" of parameters (initialization using the optimal values from the previous step) allow for rapid convergence and avoidance of local optima. Grimsley et al. [217] show that using the ADAPT-VQE method outperforms UCCSD in terms of accuracy for a given number of ansatz parameters (which is a proxy for the number of operators as we need one parameter for each operator). Using BeH2 as an example, they show that ADAPT-VQE achieves an error of 10-3 kcal/mol for about 50-60 parameters (and still significantly less than 100 for 10-5 kcal/mol), while UCCSD requires nearly 300. They also tested against random ordering of the operator pool and showed that the gradient-based ordering described above performs significantly better.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is difficult however to assess output at a comparable computational cost. While UCCSD only needs to be optimized once (over 300 parameters in BeH2 example), ADAPT-VQE needs to be optimized many times as the number of operators (or parameters) included (in addition to computation of O(N4) gradients at each iteration). Therefore, it is important to assess the comparative cost of ADAPT-VQE in terms of total number of measurements required, in addition to the number of parameters required to achieve a given accuracy. Large-scale numerical simulations may be required to assert the superiority of adaptive ansatz methods. Ref. [289] presents a numerical comparison of ADAPT- VQE and a UCCSD based VQE, corroborating the results presented in Ref. [217], showing that the former can achieve excellent accuracy (on H2, NaH, and KH), however with on average significantly more total measurements than the latter. Due to the targeted expressibility of the ansatz produced, ADAPT-VQE has also been shown to be resilient to the barren plateau problem [533] (other numerical evidence can be found in Refs. [450, 534]). ADAPT-VQE could however suffer from exponential vanishing of pool operator gradients [533], though further research is needed to characterize and address this potential issue.\n",

Qubit-ADAPT-VQE [270] and Qubit Coupled Cluster (QCC) [454] methods detailed below are methods to address this shortcoming. An alternative method called Energy Sorting VQE has also been proposed to not only compute the gradient of operator in the pool, but perform a full VQE optimization on each of them to rank them and include them in groups in the ansatz [535].

They also suggest reducing the string Pauli weights by removing the Pauli Z operators used for anti-symmetry of the wave function in the Jordan-Wigner mapping (Sec. 4 and show that this does not impact energy estimate.

[344]). Shkolnikov et al. [539] also showed that (2N - 2) is the minimum size of a complete pool comprised of Pauli strings. They also show that while minimal complete pools do not perform well on electronic structure Hamiltonian, these can be symmetry-adapted to successfully model ground state energy, achieving outer-loop measurement scaling of O(N5). Overall, this approach allows a significant reduction in the number of CNOT gates (4 per operator) required for the implementation of adaptive ansatz albeit at the cost of introducing a larger pool to sample from using the gradient-based selection rules, and as shown in Ref. [270] more parameters to achieve a given accuracy. In particular, Mukherjee et al.

This comes however with two significant caveats. First, there is no guarantee that the method can converge to the exact solution, despite successfully demonstrating the method works for small systems [287]. Secondly, the number of terms in the Hamiltonian grows in a somewhat prohibitive manner. It is estimated that the Hamiltonian grows by a factor of ~ (3/2)8 at each iteration, which means that for a number of iterations k, and with P the number of terms in ÂO, the Hamiltonian scales O(P(3/2)gk), or exponentially in the number of iterations (with an obvious upper bound of ((4N)).

      "ClusterVQE: In Ref. [306], Zhang et al. present a method that borrows ideas from ADAPT-VQE, iQCC and Mutual Information (MI) assisted Adaptive VQE to optimize the use of quantum resources. The first step in this method is to create a cluster of qubits (across the qubit register of the QPU used) that have strong MI within, and low MI across, each cluster. MI was shown to be a strong metric to measure the correlation between these quantum clusters [544], computed as presented in Eq. (173). As described in Sec. 6.3.1, the MI can be initially approximated using a DMRG approximation of the ground state wave function. Once the MI for each qubit pair has been computed, a conventional clustering algorithm can be used to create a set of clusters that minimizes the MI between clusters (sum over MIs between inter-cluster qubits).\n",

The former are used to grow the ansatz, similarly to qubit-ADAPT-VQE (see Sec. 6.3.1), the latter are used to dress the Hamiltonian similarly to iQCC (see Sec. 6.3.2).

[306] recommend selecting qubit-operators from the pool generated by single and double fermionic excitations) and ranked based on their gradients, computed as in Eq. (166). Entanglers that couple qubit clusters are used to dress the Hamiltonian, others are used to grow the ansatz to be implemented on the quantum computer. Once top entanglers have been selected and integrated, a VQE optimization is conducted. The wave function obtained is then used to update the MI (which can be computed from the one and two-body reduced density matrices) and a new loop begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "A first observation to make on the ClusterVQE is that it allows separating the ansatz into smaller, shallower depth quantum circuits corresponding to each qubit cluster [306]. The quantum circuit for each cluster can be optimized separately as their gradients are independent of the rest of the ansatz, allowing for implementation of ClusterVQE on smaller quantum computers. It is worth noting however that doing so means that the number of measurements required must be multiplied by the number of qubit-clusters, though these can be parallelized. It also means that the number of terms in the Hamiltonian is lower than the iQCC method as only certain entanglers are integrated into the dressed Hamiltonian.\n",

      "Finally, Zhang et al. [306] show numerically that ClusterVQE can achieve similar accuracy as iQCC but with significantly lower numbers of Hamiltonian terms. The shallower circuits also offer some noise resilience compared to VQE and qubit-ADAPT-VQE, though iQCC remains the most resilient due to its fixed ansatz depth. A few caveats are worth mentioning, however. Despite promising features, the dressed Hamiltonian still grows exponentially in the number of cross-qubit-cluster entanglers; while these have been shown to be few for small systems (e.g. LiH in Ref. [306]) there is at this stage no way to tell how this method scales on large, highly entangled systems. Also noted by Zhang et al., a potential bottleneck for the method is the inter-MI clustering process which could become too costly to compute accurately enough.\n",

We outline a few of these methods at a high level below.\n",

      "RotoSelect [129]: this method is built as an extension to the RotoSolve optimizer [123, 129], which we present in more details in Sec. 7.4.2. Rotosolve uses the fact that the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is a 2x periodic sine- type function of a given parameter to find the optimal value. This can be done by sampling three different values of the parameter and finding the minimum using trigonometric relationships. RotoSelect extends that idea, by optimizing not only the parameter but also the Hilbert space dimension of the rotation gate. In other words, the algorithm finds which orientation, X, Y, or Z, allows for the largest reduction in energy for a given rotation gate and replaces the orientation of the gate accordingly. This is associated with an additional sampling cost on the initial iterations of the VQE, but has been shown in Ref. [129] to significant improve convergence rate over RotoSolve and other gradient-based optimizers. These results were tested on HEA, and could be different on the likes of UCC-based ansätze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Variable Ansatz (VAns) [534]: The VAns is another algorithm that proposes adapting the structure of the ansatz as the optimization proceeds. Unlike RotoSelect, mentioned above, it not only changes the axes of rotation gates but also incorporates and removes gates throughout the process. The first step in this method is to define a dictionary of parametrized gates. From an initial circuit configuration (which can be flexibly designed), pre-defined insertion rules stochastically select gates from the dictionary to add them to the circuit. Additional simplification rules are used to identify gates with lower impact on the resulting energy and remove them from the ansatz. The ansatz is primarily designed for use on Quantum Machine Learning tasks which cannot benefit from a problem tailored ansatz (as it is the case for VQE), but is also shown to outperform HEA on the Ising and Heisenberg models, and on H2 and H4 [534]. The key advantage of this approach is the large flexibility it provides in terms of designing rules, allowing for efficient design and tailoring to any learning task, while offering some degree of resilience to the barren plateau problem. The cost of implementing the method is unclear however, and while it reduces the burden on quantum resources, it could result in a large pre-factor cost for its implementation, requiring further research.\n",

      "Machine learning of ansatz structure and Quantum Architecture Search (QAS): These comprise a series of methods aiming at learning an optimal ansatz structure using machine learning tools. While it would probably deserve a review in its own right, we outline here some key publications regarding this family of approaches. The Evolutionary VQE (EVQE) [548] uses evolutionary programming to dynamically generate and optimize the ansatz and is shown to produce ansatz which are nearly twenty times shallower (with twelve times fewer CNOT gates) than UCCSD. Rattew et al. [548] also show numerically a significant ability of the EVQE to learn and thereby reduce the impact of inherent quantum noise, all while providing resilience to the barren plateau problem. Similarly, the Multi-objective Genetic VQE (MoG-VQE) [549] uses a genetic algorithm to learn the circuit topology of a series of blocks constituting the ansatz. This results in blocks of gates resembling the HEA structure, but only spanning a limited number of qubits. The method achieves a significant reduction in two-qubit gates compared to HEA (showing that one can reach chemical accuracy on a 12-qubit version of LiH with only 12 CNOTs [549]).\n",

      "QAS was initially developed in Ref. [550] as a means to improve both trainability and noise resilience of variational quantum algorithms. Similar to the methods described above, QAS modifies the optimization problem by incorporating the structure of the quantum circuit in the cost function. In Ref. [551], Zhang et al. extend this idea by creating the Differentiable QAS (DQAS), which is based on the differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) [552]. The idea is to relax the discrete search space of network architectures onto a continuous and differentiable domain, accelerating QAS [551]. Additional work on QAS includes a version based on Neural Predictors [553], on Deep Reinforcement Learning [554], and on meta-learning [555]. QAS can also be used to improve noise resilience of an ansätze [556]. Overall, while very promising, machine learning based ansatz all suffer from a common pitfall: the cost of training machine learning models to optimize ansatz for large-scale systems remains largely untested. Studying the training cost and cost scaling for these methods would be an interesting research avenue to warrant their applicability on larger systems than has been analyzed so far.\n",

      "\n",
      "There has been a very large amount of research published on VQE ansätze over recent years, we summarize in this subsection the key findings from our research. The k-UpCCGSD ansatz [80] (and extensions) have been numerically shown to achieve excellent accuracy while offering linear scaling, thereby arguably offering the best trade-off in cost to accuracy among ansätze proposed at the time of writing. Adaptive ansätze could place themselves as a reliable alternative subject to further studies on their expected computational cost. Layered HEA are likely not suitable for large systems. As they are not physically motivated, they require a large number of parameters and need to span a significant proportion of the Hilbert space to guarantee a good ground state approximation can be reached. This also makes HEA particularly prone to barren plateaus [122]. There are good arguments however to suggest that VQE may be resilient to barren plateaus if the right design choices are made in the ansatz (except for Noise-Induced Barren Plateau [442]). In particular, these are; local encodings for the Hamiltonian [87, 91], an ansatz that is problem tailored (e.g. UCC), or is constructed adaptively during the optimization (e.g. ADAPT-VQE [217] and others), using specific initialization techniques (e.g. Ref. [90, 135], and use of a local mapping for the Hamiltonian (e.g. Bravyi-Kitaev).\n",

      "Qubit-based ansätze [287, 454, 545] (or qubit-excitations based ansätze) could be more appropriate for the NISQ era than fermion based (or hardware efficient) ansätze. That is because they offer the option to parametrize the ansatz with respect to each Pauli string used in the construction. Given enough variational flexibility, this allows forgoing Pauli-Z chains used for maintaining the antisymmetric relationship of fermionic operators under the Jordan-Wigner mapping. As such, each operator is acting on very few qubits (up to four in the Jordan-Wigner mapping, instead of O(N) when using a fermionic ansatz), reducing the reliance on costly two-qubit gates and allowing depth reduction. These however tend to require a larger number of parameters and operators, and as such may be more cumbersome to optimize and have slightly worse computational scaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adaptive ansätze have been a significant focus of recent research. While they have brought several critical breakthroughs, the scaling of the number of measurements required remains unclear. We find that the main advantages of adaptive ansätze are the reduction in number of parameters (though as far as we have seen, less than an order of magnitude), and numerically demonstrated resilience to barren plateau. This however comes at a significant computational cost of gradient estimations (scaling with the size of the Hamiltonian) and repeated VQE optimizations (shallow at the beginning of the process, but not at the end). The relative benefit of adaptive ansatz should be studied in more detail.\n",

      "Some research has been conducted on the impact of initialization on the performance of different anstze, in particular, Choquette et al. [297] numerically show that a computational basis initialization for HEA has a minor impact on target state fidelity compared to Hartree-Fock initialization. Of course, UCC-based ansätze are motivated as an evolution of a reference state, and, in general, apply to a qubit register initialized as the Hartree Fock wavefunction [37]. As a side note, Murta and Fernández-Rossier [240] propose a quantum routine to model the Gutzwiller wavefunction [557] on a quantum device. This wavefunction is a physically-motivated model which can be applied to a variety of lattice systems [558]. While not providing a full parametrized ansatz, it was shown to provide a better approximation than a mean-field method for the ground state of the Fermi-Hubbard model, and could therefore be used as an initialization strategy for lattice model VQE implementations [240]. Further research on the preparation of the Gutzwiller wavefunction is presented in Ref. [559].\n",

For the algorithm to be viable, it must be that it can learn a good enough approximation of the solution within a tractable number of learning steps. It was already demonstrated that optimization of the variational quantum ansätze is NP-hard [93], meaning that there exist at least some problems in which finding an exact solution for the VQE problem is intractable. As such, efficient optimization strategies that provide a well-approximated solution within an acceptable number of iterations are essential for any variational algorithms to be put into practice.

For example, the energy value for VQE is a linear objective function. For these problems, the objective function landscape of every single variable is a sinusoidal function. The full information of such function can be obtained by simply measuring three different points of the objective function. The sequential optimization method [128, 129, 271] utilizes this feature and calculates the minima of the sinusoidal function directly.

The CVaR emphasizes the best-observed samples and leads to a smooth objective function without introducing local minimum [600]. Also, the implementation of CVaR is relatively straightforward. Since CVaR throws away some of the samples, the accuracy of the estimation decreases. In order to get the same accuracy, the sampling number needs to be increased. The same amount of samples should be involved in the calculation.\n",

[518], was shown to also eliminate 'kinks' appearing in the VQE implementation that had been shown to appear in Ref. [263]. It is worth pointing out (as done in Refs. [38, 518]) that the Pauli strings used for operators representing the electron number or the total spin already need to be computed for the Hamiltonian thereby the method does not require additional Quantum costs with respect to the computation of the energy function. One caveat to this is that, as is the case for any constrained optimization problem, the optimization landscape becomes more complex with the addition of constraints. This, in addition to the management of the hyper-parameter u, could result in additional optimization costs and risks of local minima. The use of this method, and further considerations regarding optimal application have been discussed in Ref. [601].\n",

      "In this Section, we have reviewed some of the latest optimization strategies adapted to optimize variational quantum ansätze. Some methods are adapted from the traditional numerical optimization, while some new methods are developed to provide some essential features specifically for variational quantum ansatz optimization.\n",

      "The first key feature to consider is the speedup of the convergence for variational quantum ansatz. From the convergence speed per iteration, the analytical method is much faster than the gradient descent strategies. However, the analytical methods would require taking more measurement points to finish a single iteration, which is unfair to directly compare the convergence speed per iteration between optimization strategies. Numerical studies have nonetheless shown in multiple occasions that Rotosolve (and by association its extensions) indeed reach convergence significantly faster than other methods [128-130].\n",
      "\n",
      "Several studies have been performed to compare the relative strength of convergence of different optimizers. Mihlikov et al. [603] show as part of a case study on Hydrogen that SPSA presents a clear advantage on the Nelder-Mead and the Powell optimizers. Bonet-Monroig et al. [604] test four different optimizers on a variety of small molecular systems and find that SPSA performs slightly better than all others. Beyond these studies, several methods allow for improved convergence on almost any optimizer: the covariance functions between the Hamiltonian and operator can also be used to increase the convergence speed when the optimization is almost converged [605]. Stochastic methods are also suggested as add-ons to reduce the impact of hardware noise, accelerating convergence speed [606-608].\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key feature is the resilience of the barren plateau problem. The natural-gradient-based strategy is considered resilient to barren plateau, and its absolute value of gradient has a lower bound 1/(22N+1) [126, 127]. The analytical method is gradient-free and directly jumps into an optimal or approximately optimal position in each iteration, which can prevent entering a barren plateau through optimization dependent on a learning rate [128- 130, 271]. However, this is at the cost of increasing the measurement points and conventional computation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the discussion above, no optimization strategy outperforms other strategies in every aspect; the convergence needs to trade with the implementation complexity and measurement points. In fact, multiple strategies can be applied together to improve the overall performance of the optimizer. In practice, the sequential analytical fitting method has been mainly used when a non-traditional optimizer optimizes the variational ansatz. Quantum natural gradient-based methods are more popular in simulation-based studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "A final comment is worth raising on the optimization of VQE ansätze: it does not need to be done entirely using samples from observable obtained on the quantum computer. In particular Okada et al. [305] have shown that one can use efficient circuit simulation to optimize local order parameters and subsequently use quantum devices post- optimization to measure the global quantities.\n",

      "## 8. Error mitigation for VQE\n",
      "\n",
      "When the noise of a quantum computer is below a certain threshold and a sufficient number of qubits are available, quantum error correction schemes can be applied to suppress the noise to arbitrarily small levels [76]. However, hardware demonstrations of simple quantum error correcting codes have been limited and have only demonstrated fault- tolerant universal quantum computation with limited error-correcting capabilities [609-616]. Error correction also brings different types of overheads, including large amounts of extra ancilla qubits, fast decoding and communication between quantum and conventional devices [76]. For example, assuming an optimistic error rate threshold of E = 10-3, the required number of physical qubits to start exploring interesting quantum chemistry problems could be of the order of 106 [233].\n",
      "\n",
      "As an alternative, a series of techniques for mitigating the effects of noise in quantum algorithms running on NISQ hardware have been developed. These techniques have been shown to achieve a reduction in the noise levels of expectation value estimates, without requiring the large resources involved in error correction. Such methods will be critical for early implementations of the VQE algorithm in order to achieve the required precision for Quantum Chemistry computation. Although error mitigation can also benefit other algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm [136], we focus our discussion on the relevance of these methods for VQE. In this section, we cover the most relevant error mitigation techniques for VQE algorithms. For a more complete review of error mitigation techniques, we refer readers to [617].\n",

      "(Sec. 4.3) or as properties to design the ansatz (Sec. 6.2.3). Here, we discuss how symmetry can be used to mitigate errors on a quantum state p prepared by an ansatz.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general idea is that we need to find a way to measure the expectation value (S) of the symmetry operator S. Then we can filter out the experiments p having the wrong number (S), i.e. we post-select the experiment outcome based on (S). Such a verification process has many error-mitigating benefits. The first is that verification filters out errors that violate the symmetry, which applies regardless of the error rates of the quantum computer, although the failure rate is higher when the error rates increase [274]. The potential for filtering noise on measurements has been demonstrated experimentally in a VQE algorithm [156]. At the same time, the measurement and the post-selection on the result can project the state into a subspace that preserves the symmetry, and hence increase the overlap of the state p prepared using the ansatz with the symmetry preserving subspace [275]. Therefore, the symmetry verification method should be considered together with other symmetry preserving methods when preparing the target state in a VQE algorithm [156].\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we briefly mention two specific techniques to measure S. The first is called the final symmetry verification, in which we only verify that symmetries are respected at the end of the computation, i.e. after the ansatz circuit. This usually comes at no additional cost as the Pauli terms included in S are often measured as part of the Hamiltonian. The second is named bulk symmetry-verification, in which the symmetry verification step may be carried out during the computation, i.e. inside the ansatz circuit, without disrupting the computation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final symmetry verification: Verifying the symmetry at the end of the computation is relatively straightforward. For example, when using a Jordan-Wigner mapping, the electron number parity and the spin number parity of the state p produced by the ansatz can be directly measured at the end of the computation. We give an example of such measurement in Fig. 14. On the other hand, if the symmetry operator is more complex but can still be decomposed into a weighted sum of Pauli operators, it could then be measured using the same technique in VQE, even reusing data obtained already in measuring the energy of the state p.\n",

That is, each Pauli observable measured separately should be modeled with an independent (Ô)(E|a). The reason is that the difference in noise from measuring different Pauli observables is a result of the different circuits required to rotate the state in the desired measurement basis. While this is likely insignificant for naive measurements of all Pauli observables, it becomes very relevant when grouping strategies relying on general commutativity of the Pauli observables are introduced (see Sec. 5.2), since the basis rotation circuit depth scales as O(N2) [117]. It is worth pointing out that the parallel implementation for the VQE (as discussed in Sec. 2.7.2) also benefits from model fitting for each different hardware on which measurements are performed, especially when the noise characteristics vary across the hardware used. The effectiveness of extrapolation methods therefore depends on the ability to characterize and systematically increase the noise strength parameter E (Sec. 8.2.1), and on the soundness of the mathematical model (Ô)(E|a) (see Sec. 8.2.2).\n",

However, although it may be less interesting to consider the case when K > L when there are insufficient measurement samples to fix the free parameters in our model Eq. (281), we argue here that the K < L case is interesting; this uses a polynomial of order K, which is smaller than L, the number of measurement samples. The argument is as follows: although when K = L we may obtain a solution a such that each measurement outcome M (E;) could be exactly predicted by our model M(E|a), a model with higher-order polynomials is more sensitive to statistical fluctuations [624] and generally does not perform well for predicting new values.

For instance, the operators in the Jordan-Wigner mapping can have up to O(n) Pauli weight (non-identity operators), while the Bravyi-Kitaev mapping has up to O(log(n)) Pauli weight.

T could be measured on a quantum computer by first preparing the state in the corresponding basis j using X gates, and measuring the resulting quantum computation in the computational basis. However, since the size of T grows exponentially with respect to the number of measured qubits, it can rapidly become too expensive to obtain.

      "## 8.5.3. Exploiting state-dependent noise\n",
      "\n",
      "In certain quantum computer architectures, the design of the quantum computer makes certain states more prone to measurement readout errors than other states. For example, state |1) is often prepared as a state having higher energy than |0), which may have a stronger tendency to drop back to |0) than for a state in |0) to be excited to state |1). In other words, the measurement error can be biased towards certain states. Ref. [645] examined this phenomenon on several IBMQ quantum computers and discovered a strong correlation of the measurement readout error and the hamming weight of the measured state. To decrease the readout error, Ref. [645] proposed splitting all the measurements into two parts, the standard part, and the inverted part. In the inverted part, additional X gates are inserted before all the measurements to invert the qubits, whereas in the standard part no modification is made. The measurement outcomes of the two parts are merged together with simple post-processing to invert the measurement outcomes on the inverted part. Therefore, the effect of the measurement bias on the readout can be averaged in the merged measurement outcomes and can lead to an improvement of performance. However, it was noted that the improvement in performance depends highly on the nature of the output state, and if the output state is favoured by the measurement bias (such as the |0 ··· 0) state), this mitigation method may degrade the performance. Ref. [645] proposed another adaptive scheme to address this problem, which depends on our ability to predict the probability of certain states and its measurement bias relative to other states. The adaptive scheme therefore does not generalize well to experiments with more number of qubits. Therefore, we suggest accessing the performance of the non-adaptive approach on simplified quantum circuits where the exact quantum outcome can be calculated analytically before using this mitigation method.\n",

      "## 8.6. Other error mitigation methods There are a wide range of other error mitigation methods, which we mention briefly in what follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "· Combining different error mitigation methods: Ref. [618] proposes combining exponential extrapolation techniques with quasi-probability and symmetry verification methods, showing by simulation that a lowered estimation bias and a reduced sampling cost could be achieved through mixing different methods. Ref. [646] combines the quasi-probability method (Sec. 8.3) with extrapolation methods (Sec. 8.2) to offer more advantages, including avoiding the need for a full gate-set tomography on the quantum computer, reducing the noise level to a \"virtual\" noise level that is below the hardware noise level, and potentially reducing the sampling cost of the quasi-probability method.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Detecting errors in computation: Ref. [647] uses a simple 4-qubit error detecting code to filter out experiments where one detects an error on a quantum computer. Although it shows certain error mitigation capabilities, the limited set of quantum gates that can be executed with the error detecting code makes it difficult to apply this method to general VQE algorithms. Also, Ref. [648] uses different simplified circuits of the original VQE ansatz, constructed with Clifford gates, to detect a degradation in the quality of the output of the original circuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Combining with reduced density matrix methods: Ref. [115] proposes using the physical constraint of reduced density matrices (RDMs) for error mitigation. This method has been experimentally tested in Ref. [50] for 2- RDMs where the Mc Weeny purification formula [649] is applied to constrain the RDMs as valid physical states.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Modeling the noise: If the noise on the quantum computer can be described by an effective model, we can use data from the device to estimate the strength of noise in it and correct the measurement outcome based on this estimation. An example is discussed in the Appendix A of Ref. [159], where a simple probabilistic error model is used. In a similar spirit, Ref. [650] argues that a global depolarization model provides a good effective noise model on the quantum computer, which is used for error mitigation in the experiment to archive significant error\n",

      "\n",
      "reduction in the quantum algorithm. However, it remains unclear whether this method is scalable for algorithms requiring more qubits and deeper quantum circuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Incorporating machine learning: we may take the advancement of machine learning technologies and apply them for mitigating errors. For example, one can learn the mapping from the noisy observables (Ô)noisy from the quantum computer to the exact one: f : (Ô)noisy > (Ô)exact . Although for a general quantum state |v) it is exponentially difficult to compute the expectation value (w|Ô|w) on a conventional computer, such computation is efficient when |ų> is prepared by certain class of quantum circuits: |\\'> = Usim simulable |0). Therefore, one can use machine learning to learn a function f' mapping from (w'|Ô|\\'>noisy to (y'| Ô |\\'>exact, and use same function f' mitigating errors on the expectation value on any state (w | Ô |w), with assumption that f' is similar to f. This method has been explored experimentally for Clifford circuits [651] and for quantum circuits in the fermionic linear optics [652]. This approach has been further combined with the extrapolation based method mentioned in Sec. 8.2 [653]. Further, this idea has taken been further to develop artificial neural networks that predict the noise, or the correction needed, on given quantum circuits [654, 655].\n",
      "\n",
      "· Noise aware circuit design: Here, instead of trying to mitigate the noise from a given quantum circuit, it is asked whether one could design an ansatz that is better adapted to the noise on the quantum computer. For example, certain quantum circuits are naturally more resilient to quantum noise [656]. Then, machine learning can help produce more noise-resilient circuits for a specific task such as computing state overlap [657]. Recently, several works have been proposed applying machine learning approaches to design better ansätze (see Sec. 6 for a related discussion on ansatz design), and the resilience towards noise can be naturally incorporated in this design process [550, 556].\n",
      "\n",
      "· Noise resilience from enhanced sampling: Ref. [658] discusses a method to enhance the rate of information gain when sampling in quantum computers for estimating expectation values. It was found that by incorporating a well-calibrated noise model into their method, deeper quantum circuits can be utilized to obtain more accurate results in less time [659]. It remains to be seen whether this result holds for experiments involving more qubits.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Canceling noise using second derivatives: Ref. [660] gives a different interpretation of noise on a quantum computer as a fluctuation of parameters in the cost function. This interpretation is valid for certain stochastic noise channels which include the depolarization noise channel. Based on this interpretation, the second derivatives of the cost function can be used to cancel noise in the cost function.\n",

      "\n",
      "Firstly, error mitigation procedures tend to increase the cost of estimating expectation values of each Pauli term in the Hamiltonian. This can be quantified by a systematic increase of the variance of expectation values when more repeated experiments are required to ensure the statistical error of estimating the expectation value is smaller than a fixed threshold. Specific analysis of the increase in variance has been done for most error mitigation methods, which are summarized in the Table 12.\n",

      "However, this analysis lacks a fair comparison between the cost of different error mitigation methods. Such a comparison is difficult due to the fact that the cost depends on the nature of noise on the quantum computer, the Hamiltonian considered, and sometimes on the desired accuracy of the method itself.

      "the noise present in the quantum computer. Hence, most error mitigation methods inevitably increase the variance exponentially with respect to both the number of qubits or the number of repeated layers in the ansatz circuit for VQE. This is expected, since, in comparison with the scalable error correction technology, where one actively interacts with the quantum system in order to suppress the errors in it, error mitigation methods are mostly \"passive\", allowing errors to accumulate in the quantum system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, in the NISQ era, where the error correction technology is not applicable due to hardware limitations, there is substantial interest in studying and improving the efficiency of error mitigation methods. For example, the result of Ref. [96] indicates that the variance increase due to the error mitigation method may be offset by compromising on the accuracy of mitigation (see theorems 4 and 5 in Ref. [96]). Ref. [661] also provides an example where one trades off the accuracy of the mitigation method for a smaller variance (i.e. overhead) in the probabilistic error cancellation method (see Sec. 8.3). Another potential direction concerns the assumption made in Ref. [96] that the error mitigation method should apply to all possible quantum states. In a VQE algorithm this may not be necessary, since only the ground state is important, or more generally the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian. It remains to be researched whether the variance increase resulting from error mitigation methods can be adapted to specific subspaces of the whole Hilbert space in order to decrease its overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, it is important to note that it is unclear whether error mitigation is necessary during the initial training stage of the VQE algorithm. It is possible that error mitigation could be applied only when the optimization algorithm in VQE starts to converge. Choosing when to apply error mitigation methods can significantly reduce their cost, and therefore more research is required on this aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we want to call for an investigation of how different error mitigation methods compare with each other. The increase in variance often depends on the mitigation parameter of each method, which often affects the accuracy of the method as well. Ref. [662] makes a fair comparison of different error mitigation methods based on the same noise model. There, it is shown that the symmetry verification method has a better extraction rate than several error mitigation methods analyzed (including the probabilistic error cancellation method and the exponential error suppression method mentioned in this section), which means that it can extract all components of the error mitigated state out of the noisy state. However, the size of the error mitigated state is measured by the fidelity boost metric in that paper, and is different for different error mitigation methods. Obviously, symmetry verification's fidelity boost depends on the number of symmetry elements available in the Hamiltonian. In general, although Cai [662] does not cover a few important error mitigation methods, notably the Richardson extrapolation methods, we believe that Cai provides an important step towards understanding the dependency of the computational cost on the noise in the computer, and a rigorous comparison of different error mitigation methods.\n",

      "\n",
      "It has been argued that the VQE algorithm is naturally robust to certain types of noise [38]. However, the reality is more complicated. For example, a systematic error such as a systematic deviation resulting from an over-rotation error can be mitigated in VQE by the optimization process. In general, if a coherent error results in a unitary Uansatz (0) that is different from the expected Uansatz(0), the optimization algorithm might be able to either correct it with a different angle 01, satisfying U ansatz(01) = Uansatz(0) [663], or the correction might not be needed as long as Ũ ansatz (0) produced the desired ground state for VQE. However, this robustness also ties the results from a VQE to specific hardware, since the optimized angles can no-longer be adapted to another quantum computer. Furthermore, errors on the hardware affect the landscape of the cost function, potentially creating more local minima and therefore jeopardizing the optimization procedure. This has been experimentally investigated for the variational quantum factoring algorithm [664] (see Sec. 6.1 for relevant discussions) which is a close relative of the VQE algorithm discussed here. Finally, the variation in noise on different quantum computers poses a challenge to the parallelization of the VQE algorithm, see Sec. 2.7.2.\n",

      "The extra cost brought by different error mitigation methods is measured by a relative increase in the number of shots required to achieve certain statistical precision (relative shots amplification). Assuming a shot number of So is required to achieve a statistical error of E, with the introduction of error mitigation methods an increased number of shots AS, is required to achieve the same precision. Most of the increases in the methods presented in the table are due to the variances of observables being amplified by the error mitigation methods. An exception is the symmetry verification method where the extra cost comes from the probability that verification fails. Note that for the exponential error suppression method, the estimation can only be done approximately and depends on the factor f (which in turn depends on the amount of noise within the circuit), defined in Sec. 8.4. Although there is an exponential number of circuits that need to be evaluated in the probabilistic error cancellation method, in practice it only requires randomly sampling from these circuits, and the shot amplification is therefore only determined by its variance amplification factor YPEC. For the readout error mitigation method we expect the measurement calibration matrix T to increase the variance of the final observable, although an analytical result is currently not available.\n",

      "The computation of excited states is key to many processes in quantum chemistry and materials science, governing the dominant optical, transport and reactive properties [665, 666]. However, it is in general a significantly more challenging task than ground state computation, owing to the state generally being further away from a mean- field description, as well as less straightforward optimization to avoid the variational collapse to the ground state. Conventional correlated quantum chemical approaches [667] include Equation of Motion (EOM) coupled-cluster [668], linear response theory [669], as well as multi-reference approaches for stronger correlation [216, 670]. Quantum computing methods can be broadly divided into two main types of methods, those that rely on computing excited states within a subspace, and fully variational methods relying on modification of the VQE cost function. We briefly review the core aspects of some of these approaches below.\n",

      "Quantum Subspace Expansion: The quantum subspace expansion relies on finding an approximate Hamiltonian that spans a subspace of the full Hilbert space, but whose dimension is small and grows as only a low-order polynomial of the system size. The matrix elements of these Hamiltonians are sampled on quantum computers, but can then be tractably diagonalized on classical resources, with the higher-lying eigenvalues of these subspace Hamiltonians approximating true eigenvalues of the system. In practice, this approach starts with a ground state VQE calculation. From this ground state, it is then necessary to add additional states in order to define the span of a subspace into which the Hamiltonian can be computed. For reliable excited states, it is necessary to ensure that this space spans the dominant low-energy excitations of interest, as the whole spectrum will not be reproduced by construction. There are different approaches to choose these low energy states to span these relevant excitations, including approaches based on Krylov (or Lanczos) subspaces [239, 642, 671], and low-rank excitations of the ground state motivated by an equation-of-motion formalism [672, 673]. These approaches can also be used to yield improved ground state estimates [239, 674].\n",

      "In the quantum subspace expansion based around the equation-of-motion expansion, the resulting Hamiltonian (and overlap) matrix between these states can be found via high-order reduced density matrices evaluated from the ground state, as initially proposed in Ref. [672], and subsequently implemented on a quantum device [675]. The advantage of these methods is that they do not require particularly deep circuits to evaluate the relevant matrix elements of this subspace Hamiltonian. However, the quantum subspace expansion approaches can be quite sensitive to noise, while high-order density matrices can be expensive to sample and accumulate. Furthermore, noisy (yet unbiased) matrix elements can lead to systematic biases in eigenvalues [676, 677].\n",

      "Variational approaches: An alternative approach relies on directly optimizing an ansatz for specific excited states, using a modified cost function, which affords a fully variational flexibility, while maintaining orthogonality to lower- energy states. These have the advantage of not suffering from the limitations and biases of subspace expansion methods, but usually come at a higher cost in terms of quantum resources, and a restriction to a specific ansatz chosen. The simplest approach is to simply enforce symmetry constraints on the ansatz to a different symmetry sector to the ground state, in which case orthogonality to the ground state is guaranteed for the lowest-lying excitations in each symmetry [518] (for details about this method, please refer back to Sec. 7.5). This is however restricted to only specific excited states and limited by the symmetry of the system studied. Another approach which was proposed early on in the development of variational quantum algorithms (initially suggested for quantum computation in Ref. [38]), is to use the folded spectrum Hamiltonian [678]: A' = (H - y1)2, for which the ground state is now the eigenstate of H which has an eigenvalue closest to y. It was applied by Liu et al. [679] as a mean to probe many-body localization on a quantum computer. This method however implies squaring the Hamiltonian, which can result in a significant increase in measurements required if the operator is dense, and requires prior knowledge of the eigenspectrum (which is somewhat less of a problem in the case of vibrational spectroscopy than in the case of electronic structure computation [68]).\n",

      "The subspace search VQE (SSVQE) [680] leverages the fact that a unitary transformation between states cannot change the orthogonality of the states it is applied to. Therefore by preparing different orthogonal input states and training a VQE ansatz to minimize the energy of all these states at the same time (for instance by modifying the VQE cost function to include the sum of expectation values of the Hamiltonian with respect to each of the states, or by creating a mixed state using ancilla qubits), one can simultaneously learn the ground state and any number of subsequent excited states. It is likely however that this simultaneous optimization of the ansatz becomes increasingly more constrained with the number of excited states desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higgott et al. [459] proposed using a deflated Hamiltonian to iteratively compute successive excited states (oftentimes referred to as Variational Quantum Deflation, VQD). The algorithm works by first computing the ground state with VQE. Once discovered, the cost function is modified to add a penalty term, which corresponds to the overlap between the ground state and a new trial wavefunction. This new trial wavefunction is then trained to minimize both the expectation value of the Hamiltonian and maximize the overlap with the lower energy states. This process can be repeated iteratively for any number of excited states. The key challenge of this method is the computation of the overlap term which may require quantum cost that could be significant for a NISQ device (i.e. a large number of SWAP gates), or possibly subject to additional noise (by implementing as a circuit the complex conjugate of the ansatz used to prepare previous excited states, a method also applied in Ref. [80]), though improvements have been proposed. For instance, Jones et al. [681] propose to compute the overlap term with a low depth SWAP test, and uses variational time evolution [291]. Chan et al. [682] extend this excited state method by merging it with ADAPT-VQE [217] (see Sec. 6.3.1). Kottmann et al. [576] independently also proposed an adaptation of VQD to an adaptive method which benefits from efficiency gained from gradient evaluation process presented in the same work (see Sec. 7). Wakaura and Suksomo [683] propose an adaptation of the VQE cost function to minimize the norm of the tangent vector to the energy rather than just the energy, dubbed Tangent-Vector VQE (TVVQE). While this can be used for ground state energies, it is also combined with VQD to compute excited states. While the method is shown to provide improved accuracy compared to a UCC based VQE on simple models (Hubbard, H2, LiH), it is reported to require a run time on average five times longer than VQE [683].\n",

      "The discriminative VQE (DVQE) [460] is a further alternative method, and relies on training of a generative adversarial network to enforce orthogonality between the ground state and a trial excited state. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are machine learning tools, which are composed of two neural networks competing against each other: a generator, which is trained to produce a specific data pattern (e.g. an image), and a discriminator, which is trained to distinguish between true instances of this data pattern, and generated instances. When the training is successful, the generator learns to generate data patterns, which are indistinguishable from true ones. This concept was ported to quantum computing with the Quantum GAN [684, 685], a method, which can be used to learn an approximation of an unknown pure state. The DVQE proposed in [460] inverts the logic of the QGAN, forcing generator and discriminator to collaborate for the generator to generate a state, which is as easy to distinguish as possible from the ground state: an orthogonal state. In order to ensure that the generated state is the first excited state, one must at the same time minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. Subsequent excited states can be found by repeating the procedure iteratively. The scaling of the depth required for the discriminator remains unknown and could become an impediment for the method.\n",

      "An alternative approach is the Variance VQE method [686], which replaces the usual cost function of VQE by minimizing the variance of a Hamiltonian with respect to a state, rather than its expectation value. The idea behind this method is that the variance of the expectation value of a Hamiltonian must be equal to zero if the state used to perform the measurement is an eigenstate of that Hamiltonian (on the zero-energy variance principle, we direct readers to Ref. [687-692]). Because all eigenstates have zero-energy variance, a simple approach will not guarantee convergence to a low-energy state. This problem is addressed in Ref. [686] by combining both energy and variance minimization in order to allow for computation of low lying excited states. Zhang et al. [693] propose an adaptative variant of this method to computed highly excited states of Hamiltonians. The ansatz is grown by choosing operators from a pool of Pauli operators, akin to the methods listed in Sec. 6.3.\n",

      "Dynamical correlation functions Equilibrium dynamical correlation functions are the key quantities governing the linear response behavior of quantum systems, encoding the information of the excitation spectrum over all energy scales. These functions can either be represented in the time or frequency (energy) domain, with a key dynamic response function being the single-particle Green's function, describing the charged excitation spectrum of the system. Any method to systematically calculate individual excited state energies (e.g. via a quantum subspace expansion) and the relevant transition amplitudes coupling them to the ground state, can in principle compute these dynamical correlation functions via its spectral representation [694-698]. However, other VQE approaches exist which directly target these correlation functions in either the (imaginary) time or frequency domains [671, 694, 699]. These include VQE-based variational approaches to directly solve the linear equations for the response of a system at a given frequency [700], which can be cast as a modified cost function, with a similarly parameterized VQE ansatz [461, 701, 702]. While these approaches can describe the correlation functions to high accuracy over the whole energy range without restricting to a low-energy subspace, their challenge arises chiefly from the substantially more difficult optimization problem for the ansatz, originating from the larger condition number of the cost function, as well as the necessity for Hadamard tests to compute the transition amplitudes between the excited (or response) and ground states (for more details, see Appendix. B).\n",

These include a number of 'quantum embedding' methods, where the full space of the problem is partitioned, with each solved at a differing level of theory. In these, it is generally the strongly correlated low-energy partition of orbitals that are amenable to use within a VQE solver which are then, in various ways, coupled back to the rest of the system (potentially self-consistently) at a lower level of theory on a classical device. These multi-resolution methods can substantially extend the scope and applicability of the VQE, under additional constraints arising from this choice of partitioning and coupling of the spaces. We have provided below three examples of embedding methods adapted in this way:\n",

      "Complete active space approaches: The simplest and most widespread approach in quantum chemistry for isolating and treating a correlated set of low-energy degrees of freedom at a higher level of theory are the Complete Active Space (CAS) approaches. In these, a subset of high-energy occupied and low-energy unoccupied Hartree-Fock orbitals are considered to span the dominant strongly correlated quantum fluctuations, and treated with an accurate correlated treatment within this subspace (often full configuration interaction, see Sec. 2.4.1). This subspace Hamiltonian includes the presence of a Coulomb and exchange mean-field potential from the remaining electrons outside this space. In this way, the active space electrons are fully correlated within that manifold, leading to the Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CAS-CI) approach [107, 703]. Furthermore, the CAS-CI can be variationally optimized, by updating the choice of molecular orbitals defining the low-energy CAS space via single-particle unitary rotations among the entire set of orbitals in the system. This method is generally referred to as Complete Active Space Self- Consistent Field (CASSCF) [478, 704], or the related Multi-Configurational Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF) where the active space is not solved at the level of full configuration interaction.

In implementation on a quantum device, the rotation operator defining the active space, R, can be optimized on a classical device, while the parameterized description of the active space wavefunction can be sought via the VQE. These approaches constitute the bedrock for simulation of molecular systems with strong correlation, in particular in systems with competing spin states, excited states, systems at bond-breaking geometries, and inorganic chemistry [705- 707]. These CAS-based approaches were initially proposed in combination with VQE as a solver for the active space in Ref. [233] and were subsequently successfully demonstrated practically on quantum computers in Refs. [159, 492, 708], including self-consistent optimization of the active space.\n",

      "It should be noted that in order to achieve this optimization of the active space, the two-body reduced density matrix of the active space is required, which can have ramifications on the number of measurements required by the VQE [159]. However, in strongly correlated quantum chemistry, it is generally also important to include a description of the correlation within the orbitals external to the active space, generally via low-order perturbation theory, resulting in methods such as complete active space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) [709]. These however require computation of the 3-body reduced density matrix (and potentially higher) in order to couple the active space correlations to this perturbative treatment and are therefore considered a daunting proposition for VQE. There is also a wider range of extensions to the CASCI approach, including extensions to embedding with density functional theory (DFT) description of the environment, which has also been explored by Rossmannek et al. [710] within a VQE description of a correlated active space. Shade et al. [711] also extend these ideas to the reduced density matrix function theory (RDMFT) and demonstrate an implementation of their method to a Hubbard-like system on a quantum device.\n",

      "Density matrix embedding theory (DMET): Similar to the active space methods mentioned above, DMET [712, 713] aims at embedding an accurately correlated subspace in a mean-field environment. In contrast to CAS-CI, this 'active space' is chosen through locality criteria, starting from a local fragment space and augmenting it with the minimal number of additional orbitals (denoted the bath space) to ensure that the active space recovers the Hartree- Fock description, and explicitly captures quantum entanglement between the fragment and its environment. In this way, the DMET approach can be considered as having a similar ambition to dynamical mean-field theory [714], but cast as a static wavefunction theory (see below). In order to optimize the mean-field state of the system, the one-body reduced density matrix is matched between the individual fragment spaces between the correlated and mean-field descriptions.\n",

      "Integration of DMET with a VQE for the correlated subspace solver has been the subject of several publications [715-719], and has been implemented on quantum computers with proof of principles for relevant applications such as protein-ligand interactions for drug design [152] (with an alternative method based on perturbation theory proposed in Ref. [151]). Energy weighted DMET (EwDMET) which builds on DMET to improve its description of dynamical fluctuations for small fragment sizes (thereby moving systematically towards a DMFT description described below) [720-722] was also tested and implemented on a quantum device [159], allowing quantum phase transitions to be captured which were out of the scope of DMET. A wide range of possible alternative formulations exist for embedding correlated subspaces in (static) mean-field environments - especially when that subspace is only weakly coupled to the environment, and the explicit entanglement between the subspace and the environment can be neglected.\n",

      "Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT): DMFT again relies on a similar embedding of a (local) correlated subspace in a mean-field environment. However, this environment allows for local quantum fluctuations in its description, thereby including the effects of correlation in the local propagation of particles through the environment. This effect is captured by a local self-energy, which is the self-consistent quantum object in DMFT [714]. This necessitates a formalism built around the single-particle Green's function (a specific dynamical correlation function), which is the object which must be sampled within DMFT on a quantum device. At the heart of DMFT is a mapping from the system of interest to an impurity model, which describes a local correlated fragment coupled to a wider non- interacting set of degrees of freedom, denoted the 'bath'. This impurity model can be represented in a Hamiltonian formulation, from which the single-particle Green's function must be sampled, with various approaches to solve for this Green's function known as 'impurity solvers'. The techniques presented earlier in this section for can be used to sample this Green's function in either a time or frequency domain at each iteration in the self-consistent loop. The use of quantum computers as an impurity solver was proposed initially in Ref. [331] in the time domain, but frequency domain solvers have often been more amenable to the low-depth NISQ era.

In general, they allow for recovery of significant parts of the electron correlation energy, while avoiding treatment of the full system, thereby reducing qubits number in exchange for additional classical resources in defining the embedding, as well as a self-consistent loop. It is worth noting that the possibilities for embedding the VQE and more general quantum algorithms within wider multi-method and multi- resolution hybrid schemes extends far beyond just the quantum embedding methodologies presented above, and are likely to be of central importance in the utility of quantum algorithms in molecular modeling in all contexts in the future.\n",

      "The VQE is among the most promising near-term applications for quantum computers. While it is supported by strong theoretical arguments, there are still numerous open questions about the future applicability of the method. In this review, we outline the most relevant research that has been produced on the different components of the VQE, and how these are connected. To begin with, the choice of the Hamiltonian has direct implications for the number of qubits required, and for the capacity of VQE to achieve accurate results. A canonical orbital basis in second quantization has been the dominant choice in the community due to limited number of qubits required, although alternatives such as plane wave bases [148, 235] and frozen natural orbitals basis [85] have been proposed. Once the problem Hamiltonian has been constructed (and provided one decides to use second quantization), it is critical to decide on a mapping from fermionic operators to spin operators that best suits the system studied. While the Jordan-Wigner mapping [114] has been most commonly used due to its convenient implementation, low-weight mappings (in particular the ternary tree mapping [256] for molecular Hamiltonians, and the generalized superfast encoding [257] for lattice models) have been shown to bring significant benefits with respect to circuit depth [281] for fermionic-based ansätze and resilience to the barren plateau problem [87, 91, 258].\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most discussed drawbacks of VQE is the large number of measurements required to perform the optimization process [82, 83, 85]. Some savings can be accomplished by managing the distribution of measurements, by weighting shots allocated to each operators by their respective weights in the Hamiltonian [82, 115, 116] or by truncating terms with significant impact on the energy [38]. However, to significantly reduce the scaling of VQE one should turn towards methods which jointly measure Hamiltonian terms. At present for molecular Hamiltonian this can most efficiently be done using a decomposed interactions method [119, 262]. For lattice models, however, because low-weight encoding are more easily achieved, a simple qubit-wise commutativity grouping scheme may the most cost effective [38, 115, 117, 118, 157, 263-267].\n",

      "The core of the VQE remains the ansatz, or parametrized quantum circuit, chosen to model to the trial wavefunction. Among fixed structured ansätze the k-Unitary paired Generalized Coupled Cluster (k-UpCCGSD) [80] and its extension [311] stand out due to their ability to achieve excellent accuracy (evidenced numerous times [80, 219, 294, 311, 483]), while maintaining a scaling linear in the number of qubits. For lattice models, while Unitary Coupled Cluster ansätze have been tested (for instance [294]), one may prefer to use an ansatz for which the physically-motivated construction is more adapted. One such ansatz is the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz [82, 150], and its extensions [235, 297], which have been shown to be a promising methods for the study of many-body physics through VQE [150, 235, 297]. Adaptive methods (all stemming from ADAPT-VQE [217]), are promising avenues with demonstrated benefits [289], but their overall cost and scaling remains unclear.\n",

      "The choice of optimizer directly impacts the ability of the VQE to converge and the overall cost of the method. Comparative studies remain sparse, and it is challenging to infer the ability of specific optimizer to navigate the complex optimization landspace of VQE [93]. However, two optimizers have received at least some level of numerical supports regarding their convergence rate and ability to avoid optimization pitfalls: the quantum natural gradient [582-584], and RotoSolve [128, 129]. Finally, appropriate mitigation of quantum noise is likely required for VQE. Variational algorithms have been shown to exhibit at least some degree of ability to learn the biases created by quantum noise [38, 94, 95]. However, further methods, such as symmetry verification and extrapolation based methods, despite coming at a significant computational cost, could be required to achieve the target accuracy with VQE.\n",

      "Despite numerical simulations being presented in the vast majority of papers proposing new methods, compre- hensive, comparative and applied studies remain rare. This is most likely due to the rapid development of the field and the amount of different interacting components the VQE requires. Some notable exceptions (in particular [85]) have attempted to focus on best practices to study applicability of VQE to practical electronic structure problems. Further numerical studies of these aspects can undoubtedly help guiding future research in the field. We identify four broad areas of suggested further research: (1) optimal measurement strategies to reduce the substantial number of shots required to estimate the expectation value of a Hamiltonian using a VQE ansatz; (2) the real cost and benefits of the massive parallelization potential of VQE, which is likely required for the method to ever be relevant; (3) the extent to which the method is subject to the barren plateau problem and whether current mitigation techniques are sufficient for VQE to scale, this would also involve further studying the complexity of the VQE optimization landscape, the expected convergence rate of the method and the relevance of various optimizers in avoiding local minima; and (4) the extent of the noise resilience of VQE, and the extent to which noise can be mitigated in a tractable manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "One interesting aspect of VQE that our review has not covered is that numerous algorithms have been inspired by it. For example, the Full Quantum Eigensolver [724] (FQE) includes a quantum gradient descent to perform an optimization similar to VQE, but directly on the quantum computer to speed up convergence; the Projective Quantum Eigensolver [725] optimizes energy using residuals from projection of the Schrödinger equation, rather than gradients. The Quantum Assisted Simulator (QAS) [726, 727] and its extensions [728] aims to avoid the barren plateau problem by replacing the usual optimization loop of VQE by a three-step process: selection of an ansatz, measurement of overlap matrices on a quantum computer, conventional computing post-processing based on the data from the second step. The Quantum Sampling Regression [729] also bypasses the VQE optimization loop and focuses on sampling the Fourier basis of the energy landscape using an ansatz to perform post-processing on a conventional computer, thereby bypassing the quantum-classical communication costs such as latency. The Variational Quantum State Eigensolver (VQSE) [730] adapts the VQE to cases in which one searches eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a quantum state density matrix. The Permutation VQE (PermVQE) [731] nests the VQE in an additional optimization loop with the objective to permute the order of the qubits at each iteration and minimize long-range correlations in ground state energy. The development of such algorithms is based on a deep knowledge of both the advantages and limitations of the VQE. The Filtering VQE [732] uses filtering operators in a VQE process to find ground states more efficiently and accurately, showing the method outperforms standard VQE and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in the case of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization Hamiltonian [733]. Deep VQE [734] can be used to break down a given Hamiltonian into sub-units which can be solved separately to reduce the qubit requirements on very large systems. This methods was also extended to excited states computation by Mizuta et al. [735]. Meitei et al. [736] presented a method, later optimized by Asthana et al. [737], to perform VQE directly at pulse level (ctrl-VQE), removing the need for a gate based ansatz. Finally, variational methods have also been used to model real and imaginary time evolution of quantum systems for ground and excited states discovery [291, 738-744].\n",
      "\n",
      "To assess the future worth of the VQE as an electronic structure method, one must also consider how it can be paired with other algorithms, such as those described in the paragraph above or with QPE, to help accelerate computation where needed. The algorithm is no doubt among the most promising methods for near-term applications of quantum computers. As is the case for many emerging technologies, it faces daunting obstacles that will need to be overcome before it can be used in practical calculations, but the VQE also promises to deliver outstanding applications in fields such as drug discovery, chemical engineering, or material sciences.\n",

(52): the tree corresponding to the single-qubit encoding is the trivial graph, and the tree corresponding to the 2x-qubit enconding is built from two copies of the tree corresponding to the 2x-1-qubit enconding, where vertex k on the first tree corresponds to vertex k + 2x-1 on the second, and the two trees are joined together by making vertex 2x-1 - 1 a child of vertex 2x - 1.\n",

      "The parity encoding can also be represented this way, giving rise to the linear graph in Fig. 20. We can further generalize this to other encodings by considering disconnected Fenwick trees. We can then change our definition of R(j) to include both the children of vertex j's ancestors and the roots whose value is less than j. We then have that the Jordan-Wigner encoding corresponds to a totally disconnected graph (a graph with no edges). In the case of both encodings inspection of the corresponding Fenwick tree together with Eq. (58) recovers the same representations of â, and â; operators as in Eq. (51) and Eq. (45).

Hadamard test is frequently used to compute the amplitude (y|U |ų) (both its real and imaginary part) of an initial state |v) and a unitary gate U. This algorithm is summarized in the circuit diagram in Fig. 21. Here we explain the circuit in detail. To measure the real part of the amplitude, the quantum computer is initialized in a product state [w> > |0) with one ancilla qubit. The Hadamard gate Had converts the ancilla from |0) to (|0) + |1))/ v2. Then the controlled-U gate with control qubit on the ancilla results in the state (Uly) ® |1) + |v) |0))/v2. The second Hadamard gate gives the state (I+U)\\) |0)+(I -U)\\) |1)/2. In the final measurement, the probability of obtaining 0 is (1 +Re(y |U|} })/2, and the probability of obtaining 1 is (1 - Re(w|U|w>)/2. Therefore, the difference between the two probabilities is Re(w|U |w). Similarly calculation shows that in the second circuit (Fig. 21b), the probability of obtaining 0 minus the probability of obtaining 1 is Im(w| U|ų).\n",

The core idea is to \"measure\" p on the state Op, therefore giving the observable Tr(pOp) = Tr(Op2). It should be noted that, although that same spirit can be applied to the general case where m is an even number K = 2, 4, etc [636], only in the case of K = 2 can we achieve exponential error suppression without the over-head of controlled unitary gates.\n",

By applying a random unitary U generated from a pool on p, and measuring it on the computational basis, we can obtain a classical shadow p of p (see Sec 5.2.1 for details), and compute the numerator using the shadow § as a surrogate for p. An explicit formula is available in Ref. [748] when the pool of random unitaries satisfy the 3-design property. One significant advantage of the shadow tomography based method over other methods presented above, is that shadow tomography does not require additional copies of the same state (Sec.

On the other hand, the number of required random unitaries (Ny) to sample in order to achieve an estimate of Tr(pkÔ) within certain precision, might scale exponentially with respect to the number of qubits N. A preliminary numerically study in Ref.

QML algorithms are trained to predict molecular properties based on quantum states, thereby enabling rapid and resource-friendly exploration of chemical space.

      "Rational design of compounds with specific properties requires conceptual understanding and fast evaluation of molecular properties throughout chemical compound space (CCS) - the huge set of all potentially stable molecules. Recent advances in combining quantum mechanical (QM) calcu- lations with machine learning (ML) provide powerful tools for exploring wide swaths of CCS. We present our perspective on this exciting and quickly developing field by discussing key advances in the development and applications of QM-based ML methods to diverse compounds and proper- ties and outlining the challenges ahead. We argue that significant progress in the exploration and understanding of CCS can be made through a systematic combination of rigorous physical theo- ries, comprehensive synthetic datasets of microscopic and macroscopic properties, and modern ML methods that account for physical and chemical knowledge.\n",

      "Due to an unfathomably large number of possible molecules and materials [1, 2], and the combinatorially many ways for them to undergo chemical transforma- tions, our understanding of chemistry requires a first- principles approach with proper roots in quantum me- chanics (QM) and statistical mechanics (SM). QM gives us the ability to calculate accurate microscopic proper- ties (energies, atomic forces, electronic energy levels, elec- trostatic multipoles, polarizabilities) for fixed molecular geometries, while SM allows us to sample QM energy sur- faces in a given statistical ensemble and calculate macro- scopic properties. Accurate QM and SM simulations are computationally demanding, even for a single molecule or material, hence more efficient approaches are urgently needed to address the length- and time-scale dilemma in molecular simulations with sufficient accuracy in order to obtain insights into the evolution of properties through- out CCS. Such efficient methods may eventually enable the long-held dream of in silico chemical and materials design.\n",

      "In practice, we refer to CCS as the set of all feasi- ble metastable atomic configurations resulting from solv- ing Schrodinger's equation. Non-equilibrium molecu- lar configurations provide smooth interpolations between points in this high-dimensional chemical space. CCS is large but finite: While accounting for all possible con- formations of all stereoisomers of all possible constitu- tions of all possible compositions, it also encodes repeat- ing patterns, abundant signatures, and low-dimensional building-blocks. Fig. 1 illustrates the pervasiveness of the underpinning constituting patterns when charting CCS by drawing an analogy to stellar constellations. Cer- tain star constellations carry names, and so do certain\n",
      "\n",
      "molecules. More importantly, stellar patterns have been useful for orientation and navigation. Similarly, property patterns throughout chemical space can be combined in \"constellations\", from which properties of new molecules of interest can be calculated using linear or nonlinear combination of properties of known molecules or molec- ular fragments. While relationships for stars and planets are rather well understood, a rigorous understanding of CCS in terms of molecular components and to a similar degree has not yet been achieved but would be of utmost usefulness for rational compound design. In this perspec- tive, we argue that the recently developed machine learn- ing (ML) approaches will significantly aid in achieving a deeper understanding of CCS. We give several examples that illustrate the substantial progress achieved in this field, and outline the many remaining challenges yet to be addressed.\n",

      "Fundamentally speaking, QM describes the electronic structure of any material compound, thereby determin- ing the behavior of matter at large, and dictating all the mutual relationships between observable microscopic properties [3]. In light of such a large domain of applica- bility it is not a surprise that fundamental contributions to density-functional theory - one of the more efficient formulations of QM - are among the top cited papers of all times [4]. The unbiased study of chemical space for the purpose of exploration as well as exploitation (com- putational compound design) imposes a severe need for sampling algorithms with maximal efficiency. While QM based design of materials has already been successfully applied to some specific materials design challenges [5- 7], it imposes a prohibitive computational cost in general. Consequently, the improvement in efficiency and robust- ness of electronic-structure calculations will play an in- creasingly important role in current and future materials\n",

      "FIG. 1: The structure of aspirin emerges, in analogy to a stellar constellation, as a superposition of certain atoms (high- lighted as stars) in their mutual molecular environments, and amid a cloud of unrelated molecules. Nowadays, most QML approaches decompose predicted properties into atomic con- tributions. For example, computing quantum properties, such as the atomization energy, as a series expansion in select frag- ments called \"amons\" has by now enabled learning properties for chemically diverse molecules. Amon stands for an Atom in a Molecule, and the suffix on indicates that it can be used as a building-block dictionary entry which is selected when- ever relevant in the ensemble of constituting fragments of any larger query molecule [12]. Gray, red, blue, green, and yellow encode carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, and sulfur, respec- tively. Hydrogen atoms, as well as single and double bonds have been omitted for clarity.\n",

      "The targeted exploration of CCS aiming to obtain compounds with desired properties is a longstanding en- deavor. Many efforts in cheminformatics or materials informatics have relied on statistics and ML to search CCS for relevant pharmaceutical properties such as re- ceptor binding, toxicity [13, 14] or materials stability [15- 17]. While often useful and computationally efficient, the main drawback of these approaches is that they are not transferable to molecules and properties outside of their domain of applicability, which results from a lack of underlying principles of physics, as also pointed out in Ref. [18].\n",
      "\n",
      "Here instead we focus on recent fundamental ML de- velopments aimed at a quantum-based understanding of CCS. The key idea is that any observable property for any system can be obtained from solving the rele- vant quantum-mechanical equations. A more compre- hensive QM-based understanding of CCS is now foresee- able because of (i) maturity, efficiency & reproducibility of electronic structure methods and codes, (ii) fast-paced developments in high-performance computing hardware,\n",
      "\n",
      "2\n",
      "\n",
      "and (iii) conceptual adaptations of statistical mechan- ics and statistical learning techniques. Regarding (i), we note the many substantial theory and method devel- opments including density-functional theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock (HF) wavefunction methods, as well as the significant efforts made to ensure reproducibility across different electronic-structure codes [19]. Regard- ing (ii), the scientific codes in the electronic-structure community have matured to such an extent that a consid- erable fraction of the world's top high-performance com- puting centers busy themselves with QM calculations. Regarding (iii), continuous advances in statistical learn- ing have nowadays enabled performing intelligent data analysis on both small and large data sets, and to extract valuable quantitative insights in a systematic manner. We note in passing that machine learning has already enabled many applications in other fields [20, 21], in- cluding medical diagnostics [22-24], particle physics [25], bioinformatics [26], brain-computer interfaces [27], social media analysis [28], robotics [29] and team, social, or board games [30-32].\n",
      "\n",
      "Many recent publications, including special journal is- sues and reviews of quantum-based ML approaches [33- 36] have highlighted the fact that combining quantum calculations with ML can lead to considerable leaps in exploring and understanding chemical and materials spaces. In addition to learning quantum-mechanical ob- servables (integrating out electronic degrees of freedom), evidence has been presented that it is equally possible to build ML models of SM ensemble averages (integrat- ing out the atomistic configurational degrees of freedom), such as free energy, entropy, or kinetic pathways [37, 38].\n",
      "\n",
      "To distinguish this emerging field of physics-based ma- chine learning from preceding efforts in chemo- , bio-, and materials-informatics we will refer to combinations of QM and SM approaches with machine learning as QML mod- els in the following. QML refers to the idea of applying modern statistical learning theory to predict electronic and atomistic properties and processes in molecules and materials. We also remark that the goals and reaches of QML models should not be confused with quantum ML algorithms executed on quantum computers. As such, QML models aim to provide a feedback mechanism be- tween QM/SM and (statistical) machine learning. Given sufficient reference data obtained from QM and SM simu- lations, queries of properly trained ML models can yield accurate properties within milliseconds-as opposed to the many CPU hours or days necessary to solve the cor- responding quantum and statistical mechanics problems for representative compounds. Since QML models inter- polate rigorously in complex nonlinear spaces with con- trolled predictive accuracy, the door has now opened for more extensive analysis and study of these interpolated spaces, previously impossible due to the prohibitive com- putational cost of direct QM and SM simulations.\n",

      "cussed in this perspective article, we argue that signif- icant progress in the exploration and understanding of CCS can be made through systematic combination of rig- orous physical theories, comprehensive datasets of QM and SM properties, and sophisticated ML methods that incorporate physical and chemical knowledge. The au- thors have witnessed the quick development of the QML field from the perspective of electronic structure calcu- lations and hence the focus in this perspective will be on combining QM and ML with the goal of enhanced exploration of CCS. Efforts to use ML to capture SM properties in analogous ways are subject of active cur- rent research [39, 40].\n",
      "\n",
      "## BOX1: EXPLANATION OF QML TERMS\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we give compact explanation for various key- words discussed in this perspective:\n",
      "\n",
      ". Chemical Compound Space (CCS): The set of all feasible metastable atomic configurations resulting from solving the Schrödinger equation for the corre- sponding system of interacting electrons and nuclei.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Machine Learning (ML): Methods based on statis- tical learning theory for obtaining numerical mod- els from data samples that generalize well on un- seen data. Generally, ML models improve with the availability of more data, hence the models are said to \"learn from data\". ML models are inductive, i.e. they are typically not based on any underlying physical model, but can, in principle, reconstruct physical models from the provided data. In the context of exploring CCS, data is less abundant than e.g. in typical ML applications like computer vision. It becomes therefore important to most ef- ficiently make use of available data by combining prior knowledge about physics and chemistry with powerful ML models, as we will argue throughout this perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Representation: The model that encodes the struc- ture of and relations between atoms. It is crucial for quantifying similarities. For molecules, the repre- sentation needs to be unique and invariant to atom indexing as well as to molecular translations and rotations in space (see Fig. 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "· Supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning: Machine learning with labels is called su- pervised learning (SL). Examples of SL are clas- sification or regression where for every sample its class label or regression value is given in the train- ing data. Unsupervised learning (USL) on the con- trary has no label information; clustering and di- mensionality reduction are typical USL problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "3\n",
      "\n",
      "Semi-supervised learning assumes that most sam- ples have no label, and only for very few samples labels are provided for training.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Parametric and nonparametric models: Parametric models assume a finite set of model parameters that need to be estimated (e.g. a mean of a Gaussian), whereas nonparametric models do not make this assumption. Popular nonparametric models such as Gaussian processes can be viewed as having in- finitely many parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Regression: In regression the relationship between an input representation and continuous output variables is estimated. The most common simple regression analysis is linear regression where a lin- ear function (in one dimension a line, in N dimen- sions a hyperplane) is fitted to the data according to some loss function such as mean squared error. A widely used classical model for non-linear regres- sion is Kernel-Ridge Regression (KRR) that gener- alizes well to unseen data with limited scalability in larger data sets.\n",
      "\n",
      ". (Deep) Neural Networks (DNNs): Widely used and flexible non-linear regression models based on neu- ral networks. Deep networks refer to structured architectures that have a large number of hidden layers offering large flexibility and rich multiscale representations. Due to their scalability they are ideally suited to extract complex non-linear rela- tions from large data sets.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Cross validation: A common ML procedure used for ensuring generalization to unseen data and avoiding overfitting.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Learning curves: Measure the performance of ML models upon increasing the number of data samples used for training the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Density-Functional Theory (DFT): The workhorse method for electronic-structure calculations on molecules and materials. While DFT is in princi- ple an exact theory, in practice approximations are made for electronic quantum (exchange and cor- relation) effects. DFT implementations often pro- vide a good compromise between accuracy and ef- ficiency. Most current QML datasets for molecules and materials are based on DFT calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Hartree-Fock (HF): Fundamental electronic- structure method used as a starting point for essentially all practical calculations of quantum correlation energy in molecular systems. HF provides an exact treatment of electronic exchange effects due to Pauli repulsion.\n",

      "## GOALS AND ADVANCES OF QML\n",
      "\n",
      "The overarching goal of QML is to develop reliable models with accuracy of high-level electronic structure calculations. Depending on the application, the reference data can be obtained from high-level quantum chemistry, i.e. CCSD(T), or from DFT calculations. While much work remains to be done to reach the \"dream\" of ex- act QML models, many key advances have been recently achieved that we will review in this section and connect to important remaining challenges where we deem that urgent progress is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first salient point is that all QML advances hinge on the availability of trustworthy QM data. This data needs to cover a certain important domain, for exam- ple the CCS of organic drug-like compounds, as ex- plored by Reymond and co-workers through their GDB list of SMILES strings [62-65]. Subsequent QM cal- culations on these molecular graphs led to the pub- lication of equilibrium structures and properties of many thousands of small molecules (QM7 and QM9 datasets [41, 66]), their molecular dynamics trajectories (MD17 dataset [67]), or non-equilibrium molecular struc- tures (ANI-1 dataset [68]). On the side of inorganic ma- terials, one can calculate equilibrium structures of solids (AFLOW, OQMD, and Materials Project datasets [69- 71]), or generate equilibrium and non-equilibrium MD data for a single element (for example silicon [72]). The eventual goal of QML is to develop a universal efficient model for all of CCS capable of accurately describing molecular and materials data on equal footing, and pos- sibly leading to new insights on its underlying regularity and chemical relationships. Reorganizing the periodic table represents a first and important stepping stone in that direction [71, 73]. Initially, different models have been developed focusing either on molecular or materials data, while more recent flexible developments can already be applied to both molecules and solids [48, 49, 55].\n",

      "A crucial aspect that determines the reliability and applicability of any QML model is its generalization ac- curacy assessed on the calculated QM properties of a sufficiently large out-of-sample (hold-out) dataset. It is remarkable how quickly the generalization accuracy of QML models has improved during the past few years. As shown in Figure 2 on the example of QM9 dataset, the QML errors have decreased by 40-fold - from 8 kcal/mol in 2012 to 0.2 kcal/mol in 2018, using exactly the same dataset for training and validation. This no- ticeable increase in accuracy mainly stems from incorpo- ration of physical prior knowledge into the QML mod- els, such as proper description of permutational sym- metries of atoms in a molecule [48, 49, 67, 88], as well as explicit inclusion of physically-motivated pairwise and many-body terms for interatomic interactions into QML descriptors [44, 52]. An illustration of several widely used representations of molecules in the context of kernel- based ML is shown in Fig. 3. A noticeable conclusion from Figure 2 is that the most advanced existing QML models are extremely data efficient, achieving chemi- cal accuracy of 1 kcal/mol for QM9 dataset of 134'000 molecules using only 1000 molecules (0.7%) for training. This result hints on the potential sparsity of CCS, im- plying a low complexity and dimensionality [89] of the property prediction problem throughout CCS. In other words, this evidence suggests that (unknown) proper- ties of query molecules can be predicted as non-linear\n",

In order to further the search for improved QML models, the authors are among a group of professors who each agreed to award US$100 to the scientist(s) who devise(s) a QML model which meets the IPAM \"QM9 challenge\" [https://tinyurl. com/y2e589wj] (See Fig. 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "A critical component of every QML model lies in the representation (sometimes also referred to as \"descrip- tor\") of an atomic system composed of nuclei and elec- trons. Uniqueness of the representation is a necessary condition for QML models to converge [90], and an in- crease in similarity with respect to the potential-energy surface, i.e. the target function, lowers the offset in learn- ing curves [44]. In order to afford efficient learning, repre- sentations should also capture well-known translational, rotational, and permutational invariances of atomistic systems, but also can be significantly improved by ex- plicitly including other physical priors, such as temporal and spatial symmetries of interatomic interactions [67], or differential relationships of response properties [91]. An additional requirement is that atomistic representa- tions should be as computationally efficient as possible in order to reap the benefits of QML's computational ef- ficiency over the numerical solvers employed within con- ventional QM calculations. While both unified [59] as well as specific [42, 43, 52, 58, 61, 92] atomistic represen- tations have been proposed in the literature, there is still an ongoing debate and empirical assessment of the ad- vantages and limitations of different representations for particular application domains. While kernel-based ma- chine learning models require explicit formulation for the\n",

      "In QM calculations using quantum chemistry or DFT, different properties of an atomistic system (electronic en- ergy, atomic forces, multipole moments, polarizability, electronic energy levels) can be evaluated as QM opera- tors acting on the electronic wavefunction. The situation is more intricate in the case of QML models. Initially, separate QML models were used to describe different properties, i.e. one model for total energy, and another one for the polarizability. A first success of neural net- works applied to QM7 dataset was to demonstrate the transferability of a single NN to predict multiple elec- tronic properties at the same time [66]. In other words, the NN had learned an invariant representation, univer- sal enough to capture several properties simultaneously. Since then, kernel methods and deep neural networks have also been extended to reflect multi-property pre- diction [81, 93]. However, beyond that it would be very advantageous to view QML models as a coarse-grained surrogate for electronic interactions in an atomistic sys- tem, akin to a downfolded version of the wavefunction. In such a model, electronic properties in QML could be calculated similarly to explicit QM calculations, namely as operators on manifolds. This idea of using response operators for ML in chemical space has been recently in- troduced by Christensen et al. [91]. Various QML models of electron densities and wavefunctions have by now also been introduced [94-100]\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the chemical space of molecules and mate- rials can be expanded into compositional (chemical ele- ments forming bonds) and configurational (same bonds, but different structures) degrees of freedom. Up to now, we have mainly discussed models that explore composi- tional degrees of freedom in CCS. On the other hand, con- figurational degrees of freedom are crucial to understand dynamics of molecules under given external conditions. QML models have also been successfully employed for the construction of advanced interatomic potentials for MD applications that aim beyond the realm of classical, system-dependent force fields [48, 55, 57, 60, 67, 92]. As indicated earlier, the construction of reliable ML force fields from QM data was one of the first examples of successful applications of QML [74, 77, 78]. Recently, the focus has been shifting towards emphasizing data efficiency of QML force fields. For example, the sym- metrized gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model [88] is able to reconstruct global force fields of small molecules at the \"gold standard\" coupled clus- ter level of quantum chemistry (demonstrated so far for molecules with up to 25 atoms). The sGDML model achieves a typical accuracy of 0.2 kcal/mol in energies and 1 kcal/mol/Å in atomic forces when using only a few hundreds of molecular conformations obtained from\n",

      "an MD trajectory. Such an accuracy turns out to be cru- cial when modeling conformational transitions and vibra- tional spectroscopy of even rather small molecules such as ethanol and aspirin [101]. Hence, in the domain of dynamics of small molecules, QML has already enabled essentially exact MD simulations corresponding to a full QM treatment of both electrons and nuclei. Likewise, MD simulations of materials have largely benefited from the application of QML approaches. A recent highlight is the QML-enabled simulation of the growth mechanism of tetrahedral amorphous carbon [102, 103], which demon- strates the potential to develop a transferable DFT-level force field for studying complex processes in elemental solids.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of such substantial theoretical advances it is reasonable to wonder whether QML based predictions compare favorably to experimental observables, and if they could even assist with the analysis and possibly even help in the decision making process of the design of new experiments. In this context it is encouraging to note that QML based MD is already beginning to reach the accuracy and efficiency necessary to predict experimen- tal outcomes. For example, Ref. [104] uses path-integral molecular dynamics using the sGDML QML force field fitted with CCSD(T) atomic forces to demonstrate that low-frequency excitations of ethanol arise from highly an- harmonic combination of vibrational normal modes, thus resolving a long-standing experimental controversy (See Fig. 4 and Ref. [104] for a detailed analysis).\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalability of QML models has also been demon- strated. Atom-by-atom based training on small frag- ments represented by aforementioned AMONS was shown to yield promising results for energies, forces, NMR shifts, and other QM properties for systems of in- creasing size [12]. Extensible QML models have also been proposed in Refs. [46, 47, 53, 105, 106]. Another way to reduce complexity and increase accuracy of QML models consists of combining various levels of theory for train- ing and testing [37, 107-109]. For example, it is possible use a lower level efficient electronic-structure method as a baseline to learn QM properties of a much higher and more expensive level of theory [37].\n",

      "Finally, we note that creating universal QML based force-fields trained and applicable across CCS still re- mains an open challenge due the substantially more di- verse range of chemistries and non-local quantum inter- actions encountered when navigating configurational and compositional space at once [47, 53, 55, 91, 105, 110-112].\n",

      "into QM properties of molecules and materials, and ulti- mately enable expedient exploration of CCS and rational design of molecules and materials with tailored proper- ties. Most commonly ML methods are employed in the sciences and industry for creating highly predictive mod- els. It has been only very recently that ML models were used as a source of inspiration to learn and obtain insights about the unknown underlying inner regularities hidden in data (e.g. [47]). Given that the ML models achieve this task based on rigorous statistical theory [113], they have become helpful to generate novel research insights (e.g. [47]) or actionable hypotheses (e.g. [114]) that can be exploited in subsequent steps of (experimental) val- idation and testing. In other words ML modeling has become a powerful and indispensable part of the scien- tific discovery process itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 4 illustrates six select chemical examples of how such insights were gained through the help of QML, com- ing partially from the authors' work, as well as from other literature. First, the development of an accurate and data efficient sGDML force field model [67, 104] (see Fig. 4a) has allowed to carry out quantum molecular dy- namics simulations with essentially exact atomic forces computed with CCSD(T) level of theory. For the first time, this enabled the computation of very accurate ther- modynamic and spectroscopic observables for molecules as large as aspirin without compromising between accu- racy of atomic forces and accessible time scale of MD simulations. Future work on scaling the molecular size with frameworks such as sGDML will enable fully predic- tive MD simulations where both electrons and nuclei are treated rigorously via exact quantum-mechanical equa- tions without introducing unnecessary compromises be- tween accuracy and efficiency of molecular simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond energies and forces, a general QML model needs to be able to predict accurate electronic response properties (akin to evaluating properties as expectation values of the quantum-mechanical wavefunctions). For example, the application of response operator theory to QML models is illustrated in Fig. 4b: The QML model of the binding curve of hydrogen fluoride improves qualita- tively through the explicit inclusion of its derivative with respect to interatomic distance. The same formalism also improves dramatically the prediction of the electrostatic dipole moment, the electric field derivative of the energy, upon inclusion of the corresponding derivatives [91]. The ultimate goal of QML should be creating a unified surro- gate quantum model that can simultaneously learn many quantum-mechanical properties in a data-efficient and ac- curate manner.\n",

      "pound) [117] through an intermediate step of effectively coarse-graining chemical space is intriguing. It con- stitutes an alternative to the more conventional ap- proaches which iteratively solve the \"forward problem\" (compound -> property) using gradient based [118-120], Monte Carlo [5], or genetic algorithms [6, 117] or combi- nations thereof [121]. Furthermore, the problem of gen- erating meaningful compounds is solved elegantly in an implicit fashion by directly training on valid SMILES strings, automatically ensuring that the grammar of newly generated SMILES is not being violated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to obtain new insights is by analyzing what the QML models have learned from the data, in the spirit of explainable artificial intelligence (AI) where machine learning models are dissected to analyze their inner mechanisms that lead to their respective predic- tions (see e.g. [113, 122-124] and references therein). A suitable example of this concept is the analysis of the molecular representation learned by deep tensor neural networks (DTNN) [47]. DTNN models (and other flexi- ble nonparametric ML models) are trained on QM molec- ular energies and, in the limit of infinite data, would be able to learn the exact mapping between molecular structures and the solution of the Schrödinger equation. Since the exact solution can only be formally achieved in the limit by exactly representing the wavefunction, there is mathematically no other choice for DTNN than forming an exact representation of the wavefunction. In practice, the representation is trained on a finite num- ber of molecules, hence DTNN learns the \"Schrödinger mapping\" on a finite set of molecules which does not necessarily need to be a one-to-one representation of the wavefunction. One can query the learned representation by adding a probe atom to a given molecule [47]. By visualizing the energy isosurface of the probe atom, one can immediately see that the obtained representation ex- hibits features that closely resemble electron densities or electrostatic potentials, indicating that the model is able to infer QM features in the representation directly from a restricted set of QM energies (see Figure 4d). Hence, the DTNN approach is attempting to solve an inverse prob- lem [125] of constructing a coarse-grained QM represen- tation from a finite set of molecular energies or other QM properties (see Fig. 4d). Despite being trained only on total energies of molecules, the DTNN approach clearly grasps fundamental chemical concepts such as bond sat- uration and different degrees of aromaticity. For exam- ple, the DTNN model predicts the C6O3H6 molecule to be \"more aromatic\" than benzene or toluene [47]. It turns out that C6O3H6 does have higher ring stability than both benzene and toluene and DTNN predicts it to be the molecule with the most stable aromatic carbon ring among all molecules in the QM9 database [47]. In- terestingly, the mathematical construction of the DTNN model (and other flexible nonparametric models based on atomic contributions) provide statistically rigorous par-\n",

As an outlook into future work, it would be desirable to unify both ML architectures (DTNN/SchNet and SchNOrb) to gain enhanced under- standing into quantum mechanics of molecules by com- bining the direct \"Schrödinger map\" (SchNOrb) with the inverse \"Schrödinger map\" (DTNN/SchNet).\n",

      "van der Waals interaction) and a large electronic HOMO- LUMO gap Egap (exhibiting stability to external electro- static fields). These three requirements would normally be considered contradictory to each other. Firstly, sta- bility is typically inversely correlated with polarizability - stable molecules are normally thought to have small polarizability [126-128]. Secondly, HOMO-LUMO gap is the leading-order contribution that appears in the de- nominator of the polarizability formula, hence it is of- ten assumed that polarizable molecules should have small HOMO-LUMO gaps. One is then faced with a difficult question of whether the formulated design problem of low E, high a, and high Egap is hopeless? This question can be partially answered by analyzing the pairwise correla- tion between different molecular properties for a large but finite set of drug-like molecules. These correlations are shown in Figure 5 for roughly 7k molecules in the QM7 dataset. The first observation is that the correlation be- tween most electronic properties is rather weak, if at all present. Most strikingly, above the lower bound of polar- izability and atomization energy (both must be bounded from below) we observe no visible correlation. The same observation is made for polarizability vs. HOMO-LUMO gap. This pairwise comparison of three different prop- erties leads us to the suggestion that one can find many drug-like molecules that satisfy the seemingly contrasting requirements of high stability, high polarizability, and a large HOMO-LUMO gap. Similar \"freedom of design\" is observed for HOMO vs. LUMO eigenvalues, as well as for HOMO-LUMO gap vs. heat capacity. This data-driven analysis, spurred by the QML approach, illustrates a novel way to look at rational design in CCS, breaking conventional descriptor-property rules as well as notions of restricted chemical diversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "These developments result in a paradigm shift in atom- istic simulations, due to (a) usage of rigorous QM/SM priors and data, instead of heuristic cheminformatics, (b) a holistic explorative and comprehensive view on CCS, rather than the traditionally assumed encyclopedic view where each process is studied one compound at a time, and (c) insights provided by novel tools relevant for sev- eral scientific communities, i.e. electronic structure pre- diction, material science, organic chemistry, molecular dynamics and drug discovery. Figure 6 illustrates how this new view could be leveraged for boosting more con- ventional computational compound design applications, and contribute substantially to on-going experimental ef- forts, as also recently reviewed in the context of catalyst design [36]. As such, QML is clearly already taking the first steps in the direction of generally tackling the inverse design question in CCS [87, 117, 125].\n",
      "\n",

      "marks - a fact that has driven e.g. the field of computer vision to exploring larger and ever more complex sce- narios (e.g. [129, 130]). It will be therefore important to establish high quality large scale data resources that can enable a new model generation that increasingly ex- plores both compositional and configurational aspects of CCS [47, 105].\n",
      "\n",
      "However, while having comprehensive big data in CCS would be helpful, due to the combinatorially scaling CCS it remains crucial to develop efficient models that only rely on small amounts of data. Clearly, learning with abundant data is straightforward, but it becomes more challenging to reliably learn from small datasets. Here it becomes crucial to include prior physics-based knowledge and invariance information to become more data efficient without compromising the robustness and accuracy of the QML model [67, 88, 104].\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, this new generation of models should ide- ally quantify the uncertainty of its own prediction [94, 131, 132] possibly in combination with active learning strategies that may lead to improved sampling of CCS and effectively lead to lower model uncertainties [51, 133]. It is important to note that active learning actually in- duces non-stationarity in learning [134]. In addition, models will need to be able to explain their prediction (e.g. [113, 122]) such that a model will not only serve as predictor but in addition as a source of generating in- sight [47, 55]. In other words, novel developments need to consider data generation, model building, explanation, insight extraction and sampling in a single comprehensive framework.

      "Furthermore, current limitations and shortcomings of QML models include predicting intensive properties such as the eigenvalues of molecular orbitals [45], or excited state properties such as excitation energies [135, 136]. Transferable yet accurate QML models of electron den- sities [137] and molecular orbitals in molecules and band structures in solids also remain a challenge. Another is- sue, lurking behind rigorous and robust statistical learn- ing procedures, such as k-fold cross-validation and con- verged learning curves, is the selection bias encoded in many of the training sets employed in the field: Stability or property distributions are typically unknown in CCS, and therefore hamper the rigorous assessment of the de- gree to which any given data set is truly representative of broader chemical spaces. Similar problems of repre- sentability were also encountered when trying to mea- sure how accessible website content is reflected in search results when using different search engines [138, 139].\n",
      "\n",
      "Other challenges include (i) the determination of the irreducible set of variables (formal scaling is only an up- per bound but what is effective dimensionality? (see e.g. [89]), (ii) the question of how to render prediction errors constant throughout CCS, and (iii) a quantitative understanding of the relation between the QML models' learning efficiency, as manifested in learning curves, and the dimensionalities of CCS as encoded in the training data.\n",

      "## Multiscale QML models\n",
      "\n",
      "A very promising research direction is the integration of QML models across different levels of theory. Exploit- ing decades of research on the validity and applicabil- ity of the various approximations made when solving the Schrödinger's equation, ample data obtained with com- putationally less demanding approximations can be com- bined with fewer but more accurate data points. As a re- sult, the QML models must only learn the differences be- tween the various levels of theory, which is substantially less demanding in terms of data needs. As such, these 4- learning approaches allow to invest the model complexity on the truly difficult aspects [37, 107, 108, 140-142].\n",

      "Many studies so far have successfully explored structure-property relationships in restricted chemical spaces.

Here, we have connected some of the ongoing efforts\n",

      "## Towards molecular design with QML\n",
      "\n",
      "In the following, we would like to outline three con- crete open challenges where QML tools still have to be developed in order to find broad application.\n",
      "\n",
      "(i) More observables The use of QML in order to es- timate statistical mechanics observables, e.g. lead- ing to the prediction free energy profiles of rare events, remains an outstanding challenge. This will enable direct validation by comparison to exper- imental gas-phase rate constants from the litera- ture, as well as to vibrational or linear free energy perturbation based free energy estimates. In order to compare to liquid chemistry results, one has to also include solvent effects (calculated through con- tinuum solvent models, through addition of shells of solvent, or through periodic boundary condi- tions). If necessary, one should also include nuclear quantum effects through use of path-integral sim- ulations. These developments will serve the goal of establishing once and for all the validity of the QML based approach by direct comparison to ex- periment, rather than to pre-calculated quantum results.\n",
      "\n",
      "(ii) Experimental design QML forms the natural ba- sis for software capable to run assisted (automa- tized/robot) experiments or helping scientists with experimental design decisions. Some work along those lines, suggesting new materials, has already been published [71, 115, 143, 144]. Latent space ap- plications and computational alchemy can be com- bined with state-of-the-art optimizers, in essence paving the way towards the experimental realiza- tion of aforementioned multi-property design tasks relevant to the identification of promising drug, photovoltaic, battery or catalyst candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "(iii) Reaction design using QML. Computer based re- action planning and discovery has a longstanding history in chemistry dating back to the sixties, and including contributions by Corey et al in 1972 [145], or Herges and Hoock in 1992 [146]. A compre- hensive review of the field has recently been pub- lished [147], also discussing the Chematica software which proposes new synthetic routes based on new combinations of already established reactions re- ported in the literature. Laino and co-workers [148] and Segler et al [149] also introduced literature\n",

      "based ML models for chemical reactions. Such approaches can be problematic, however, when it comes to combinations or reaction conditions for which previously published reactions are not rep- resentative. Moreover, the approach is inherently biased to historically known chemistries and com- binations thereof, excluding the possibility to dis- cover entirely new reaction mechanisms and syn- thesis pathways. The latter point, however, is crit- ical for example in the context of developing new catalysts, and more fundamentally to fill any exist- ing \"gaps\" of our understanding of potentially use- ful reactions. In order to computationally predict novel reaction profiles we must rely on universal first principles based numerical simulation of the relevant quantum and statistical mechanics which accounts for the electronic and atomic movements resulting in the relevant reaction energies and bar- riers [150-152]. QM and SM represent the appro- priate physics framework necessary to describe the electronic rearrangements occurring during a reac- tion and for the freedom to dial in atomic config- urations and chemical composition at will. When optimizing reactions through screens of prospective combinations of reactants, products, and external conditions, the role of solvents and catalysts is cru- cial as they can alter the ranking and even render reactions realistic which otherwise would have been impossible. One therefore has to expand training sets to include libraries of solvents and simple cat- alysts, and apply extended QML models not only of energies and forces but also of statistical me- chanical averages. Once trained, these QML mod- els could be used to optimize reaction conditions (solvents, ions, temperature, pressure) in chemical space using gradient-free optimizers such as Monte Carlo/Genetic/or simplex algorithms. First steps in this direction were already taken in 2012 by Rupp et al. [153].\n",
      "\n",
      "## CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "Over recent years, overwhelming evidence has been gathered by the community suggesting that QML mod- els can truly generalize throughout CCS. As such, a paradigm shift has occurred when moving from glob- ally fitting parameters in fixed functional forms, in- spired by physics informed models (such as UFF [154] or semi-empirical methods (such as PM6 [155, 156] or DFTB [157]), to locally optimizing regression weights in generic basis set expansions which can be converged in size. Resulting QML models enable (a) rapid pre- dictions of relevant quantum properties for new out-of- sample systems (after training) and (b) converged pre- dictive power through sufficiently large training sets (as\n",
      "\n",
      "evinced by convergence properties of learning curves). Thanks to the tremendous reduction in computational cost of query tasks, QML models enable to shift the focus away from studying individual instances in CCS towards entire ensembles of compounds. Recovery (or rejection) of known, and discovery and elucidation of un- known structure-property relationships has therefore be- come a feasible, realistic, and valuable goal which was previously not accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conceptual challenges include the definition of locality in CCS, i.e. when the QML models are interpolating or rather when their validity fades. While ensemble meth- ods and Gaussian Processes provide a first direction of uncertainty quantification in a limited domain of applica- bility, mathematically and physically more well founded methods are still waiting to be discovered. Rigorous def- initions of diversity (e.g. [158]), properly rooted in QM and SM, might also be necessary to tackle selection bias problem and to maximize data efficiency. First principles based diversity measures would have to properly account for all sorts of systems including metal organic frame- works (MOFs), nano-materials, organic materials, func- tional materials, inorganic crystals, metastable solids, liquid mixtures, or bio-systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "An educational challenge corresponds to the estab- lishment of the academic curriculum for this interdisci- plinary young field, where chemistry, physics, and com- puter science have to develop tightly interwoven research programs. Conventional curriculae in traditional depart- ments of chemistry, materials science, physics, computer science, or biology departments do not cover the course- work necessary for students to appropriately reach a level where they can meaningfully contribute to this line of re- search.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we would like to stress that the progress made and described herein is dwarfed by the scope of the prob- lem: Gaining virtual control of CCS through physics based understanding has remained elusive for all of hu- manity's past scientific efforts. One of the many rewards of reaching this goal would be the routine discovery and design of interesting molecules and materials with de- sired properties. As such, the community has so far just been scratching the surface of what is to come. To further push the frontier of this field of science, sustained and in- creasing investments are necessary in terms of computer power, interdisciplinary education and training, funding agencies and most importantly: human interdisciplinary creativity.\n",

      "The paper by O. Anatole von Lilienfeld, Klaus-Robert Müller, and Alexandre Tkatchenko presents a perspective on the recent progress and future challenges in the field of quantum-based machine learning (QML) for exploring chemical compound space (CCS). The authors outline how QML can aid the design of new compounds with desirable properties by systematically combining rigorous physical theories with machine learning (ML) methods. They highlight the need for efficient methods to evaluate molecular properties due to the vast number of possible molecules and their potential transformations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The authors argue that QML methods, which apply modern statistical learning theory to predict properties of molecules and materials, can offer significant advances in understanding CCS. QML models are desirable because they are trained on reference data obtained from quantum and statistical mechanics simulations and can interpolate in complex nonlinear spaces, providing accurate property predictions within milliseconds, unlike conventional simulations which can take much longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "By leveraging QML models, chemists can more quickly analyze and study CCS, a process that was previously hindered by the computational cost of direct quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics simulations. The paper presents several examples demonstrating QML's substantial progress and data efficiency, while calling attention to the challenges that remain, such as creating universal QML based force-fields and ensuring that QML models generalize well within CCS. \n",
      "\n",
      "The paper also discusses the use of QML for gaining new insights into QM properties of molecules and materials, and the potential of QML models to impact a wide variety of scientific fields. The authors conclude by highlighting the ongoing need for interdisciplinary education and investment to further develop this promising area of research.\n",

Here we combine a high- dimensional neural network potential, which allows to predict the energies and forces of a large number of structures with first-principles accuracy, with a global optimization scheme employing genetic algorithms. This very efficient setup is used to identify the global minima and low-energy local minima for a series of copper clusters containing between four and ten atoms adsorbed at the ZnO(1010) surface. A series of structures with common structural features resembling the Cu(111) and Cu(110) surfaces at the metal-oxide interface has been identified, and the geometries of the emerging clusters are characterized in detail. We demonstrate that the frequently employed approximation of a frozen substrate surface in global optimization can result in missing the most relevant structures.\n",

      "Supported clusters, with the cluster and the support being either metals or oxides, are an active area of research1-5 in surface science and catalysis. Accordingly, they have been studied extensively both with theoretical6-8 and experimen- tal9-12 methods. A prominent example for such catalysts that is used in the industrial synthesis of methanol13-15, consists of ZnO and Cu nanoparticles. Given the commercial impor- tance of methanol as a solvent and as a reagent, this system has received a lot of attention in recent years, and many the- oretical16-20 as well as experimental21-26 studies are available with the aim of unraveling the structural details of this system.\n",

      "Computer simulations can provide valuable information, complementary to experimental data, but theoretical studies of supported clusters are hampered by several challenges. The first one concerns the system size, as supported clusters can be very large containing hundreds or even thousands of atoms, and large supercells are needed for realistic structural models of the support to prevent spurious interactions between ad- sorbed clusters and other finite-size effects. This rules out the use of demanding electronic structure methods like density- functional theory (DFT) for all but the most simple systems, as most simulation techniques like molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) require the computation of thousands to millions of configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simple and thus computationally cheap empirical poten- tials would allow to study a large number of structures, but reliable atomistic potentials for supported clusters, which pro- vide a direct functional relation between the atomic positions\n",

      "and the potential energy, are difficult to construct due to the complex and diverse bonding and interactions present in these systems, and consequently they are available only for a few systems27,28. Thus the second challenge is the lack of reliable potentials, which are able to cover the wide variety of atomic environments and bonding patterns present in the nanoparticle and the support.\n",
      "\n",
      "A possible solution to this dilemma is offered by machine learning (ML) potentials29-31, which can provide very accu- rate potential energy surfaces (PES) based on reference data sets for representative configurations obtained in electronic structure calculations. Once constructed, ML potentials al- low to compute the energies and forces of large systems in a very efficient way enabling the study of realistic structural models, while the first-principles accuracy of the underlying reference method is essentially maintained. Starting with the seminal work of Doren and coworkers in 199532, the tech- nology of ML potentials has made rapid progress in recent years, and many algorithms are available, like neural network- based approaches33-39, Gaussian approximation potentials40 moment tensor potentials41, spectral neighbor analysis poten- tials42, and many others. Here, we utilize high-dimensional neural network potentials (NNPs) proposed by Behler and Parrinello in 200743-45 to study small copper clusters sup- ported on the (1010) surface of ZnO. High-dimensional NNPs of this type have been used successfully in the past for a series of related systems like copper46, brass nanoparticles47, zinc oxide48, water at copper49 and zinc oxide surfaces50, and also for the copper-zinc oxide system18.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, here we use NNPs to perform genetic algo- rithm (GA)51,52 based global optimization (GO) searches of pure copper clusters containing between four and ten atoms supported on the low index zinc oxide (1010) surface. Other recent papers53,54 have shown the usefulness of such a com- bined NNP+GA approach. Combining both algorithms allows for generating a new potential for a target system \"on-the-fly\", while at the same time requiring a minimal amount of elec- tronic structure calculations. The generated NNP is then used\n",
      "\n",
      "to run GA searches, and good candidates from this GA search are used to further refine the potential. This procedure could, in the future, easily be adapted to run automated global opti- mization searches on a wide range of materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous GO searches of this or similar systems utilized ei- ther parametrized classical force fields20, or relied on ab-initio calculations, which requires them to pre-optimize the clus- ters in an isolated configuration in vacuum55 before depositing them on the surface. The NNP allows us to easily include the influence of the support on the optimized clusters in the GO search, without needing to resort to isolated clusters. Addi- tionally, it allows us to run much longer GA searches which provides for better sampling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper is organized as follows: Section II summarizes the key concepts of high-dimensional NNPs and GA searches. In Section III we describe our computational setup for the reference DFT calculations, the procedure for generating the NNP data set, the parameters for the NNP construction and the details of the GA search. In Section IV we present our re- sults addressing the structural properties of the clean ZnO sup- port (IV A), the global minimum and low-energy local minima from Cu4 to Cu10 (IV B), the interface structures (IV C), the geometric properties of the optimized clusters (IV D) and the role of a possibly frozen support surface (IV E). Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section V.\n",

      "## A. Neural Network Potential\n",
      "\n",
      "Neural networks (NN) are one of the main methods in use in the realm of machine learning. They are capable of repro- ducing any well-behaved function56, such as the potential en- ergy surface (PES) of a system of atoms, if a set of points where the function has been evaluated is available. In the present work we utilize fully connected, high-dimensional, feed-forward neural networks introduced by Behler and Par- rinello43,45, which are constructed to reproduce reference data sets containing the energies and forces obtained from ab-initio calculations for a diverse set of structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Behler-Parrinello approach, the system for which the energy and forces are to be predicted is broken down into atomic environments, each of which consists of a central atom and all other atoms within a certain cutoff radius. Each of these subsystems is processed by a separate feed-forward NN, unique to each element but shared across atoms of the same element. Each of these elemental NNs possesses the same set of weight parameters, and predicts an atomic energy contribu- tion as a function of the chemical environment. These atomic energies are then added to provide the total potential energy of the system. Analytic gradients to determine the atomic forces are readily available.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the input layers of the atomic NNs the information about the atomic environments is provided using vectors of sym- metry functions57. These serve as structural fingerprints with the required translational, rotational and permutational invari- ance. In a training process the weight parameters and biases\n",

      "connecting the different nodes of the network are adjusted un- til the output matches the available ab-initio reference data. For this, it is necessary to sample the PES of the system, by performing single point calculations at different positions of this PES. Once the NNP has been trained, it is able to predict the energies and forces at a fraction of the computa- tional costs of the underlying electronic structure method, and can be applied to much larger systems than are accessible by DFT. For all details about the method, the training process and the validation strategies for high-dimensional NNPs the interested reader is referred to a series of recent reviews of the method44,45,58\n",
      "\n",
      "## B. Genetic Algorithm\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic algorithms51,52 are a class of global optimization algorithms. They rely on codifying the properties of the sys- tem in form of \"genes\" of a given configuration, assigning a fitness criterion, which in the case of global structural opti- mization often is the potential energy, but other target crite- ria are possible59, and then selecting and crossing over these genes with the purpose of generating new, fitter candidates. Along the way, variability is introduced into the candidate pool in the form of mutations that directly affect this genome. The final goal of this GO algorithm is to quickly generate and evaluate candidates, exploring the configuration space until the fittest candidate corresponding to the global minimum is found.\n",
      "\n",
      "GA can be utilized for optimizing different kinds of sys- tems60, and the procedure is rather standardized for struc- tural optimization of atomic systems61 The genes in this case consist of the coordinates of the atoms of inter- est, and elemental composition for multi-elemental systems. Crossovers between candidates are achieved by cutting the system along random planes52 and recombining the gener- ated parts while maintaining the system's size and stoichiom- etry. After crossover events, the new configurations are mini- mized, in an approach similar to basin hopping Monte Carlo66 (BHMC), and it is acknowledged that both algorithms in fact sample the same transformed PES configuration space66.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strictly speaking, a genetic algorithm requires that the properties of the system are encoded into strings that can then be mutated and combined, such as for example listing the ele- ments at given positions of a defined crystal structure59. Mod- ifying directly the coordinates of the system as we do in this work is more akin to modifying the phenotype rather than the genotype of the configurations. This kind of algorithms are more accurately described as \"evolutionary\" algorithms. We nonetheless refer to it as a genetic algorithm throughout the text as this is the more commonly in-use designation, and evo- lutionary algorithms are a subset of genetic algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fitness is usually evaluated through the potential energy since the goal is to find the lowest energy configuration. Mu- tations are applied as direct, large-scale modifications to the coordinates of the candidates, such as mirrorings through a plane, i.e., discarding one half of the cluster and mirroring the other half, which leads to new configurations if the original\n",
      "\n",
      "cluster was not symmetrical through that plane; or rotations, such as partial rotations of a section of a cluster, or rotations of a supported cluster over a support. This results in a rapid ex- ploration of the PES by generating and evaluating thousands of structurally different candidates in quick succession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some GAs make use of a generational ansatz, where the algorithm proceeds in steps by fixing the fittest population, generating new candidates, evaluating them, and proceeding to recalculate and update the fittest population. This ansatz is ideal for ab-initio based searches, since there is a long wait time for evaluating the new population that can be partially reduced by parallelization within a generation. This has been shown not to be necessary for a successful GA search67, and our NNP based calculations are extremely fast compared to similarly sized ab-initio relaxations. For this reason we utilize a continuous approach, where the fittest population is updated every time a relaxation is finished, and new candidates are continually pulled from this population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mutations are the key for efficiently exploring the PES. Similar to Monte Carlo simulations, poor mutations will ad- vance the system through an inefficient route, and only rarely new good structures will be generated. Mutations should thus result in big changes to the candidate, but at the same time generate \"reasonable\" structures, which is aided by the final geometry relaxation every candidate goes through. In our case we have made use of the following mutations, which are applied only to the atoms belonging to the cluster, while the atoms of the support only change positions in the subsequent local geometry optimizations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Rattle mutation: Inspired by basin hopping Monte Carlo66, all atoms in the cluster are displaced at random up to a maximum amount. The displacement is slightly biased in the positive z direction to avoid atoms pene- trating into the support. This move helps the cluster to expand across the interface with the support and also to grow in height.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Twist mutation: The whole cluster is twisted by a ran- dom angle around a vector that passes through its cen- ter of geometry (COG) and is perpendicular to the slab surface. We note that the COM is used here as an element-independent generalization instead of the also frequently used center of mass (COM) of the cluster, since the COM does not coincide with the COG for clusters with more than one element. The cluster is also lifted a small random amount in the z direction to avoid repulsive overlaps with the topmost surface atoms. This move helps the cluster to align itself with the atomic patterns of the support.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Angular mutation: Several atoms of the cluster are picked based on their distance to the COG with the fur- thest away atoms being picked first, and displaced to positions on a hemisphere centered on the COG and whose radius is the average distance of all atoms in the cluster to the COG. This move has been inspired by Rondina et al.68, which describe other possible in- teresting moves that can be adapted from BHMC. This\n",
      "\n",
      "3\n",
      "\n",
      "move helps the cluster grow out in a 3D mode, avoiding flat clusters.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Mirror and shift mutations: A random plane passing through the COG of the cluster is selected, and the cluster is mirrored through this plane. To avoid fre- quent overlaps at the mirror plane, the mirror image is shifted a small amount away from the plane at random, which increases the acceptance ratio of the move. This move helps to generate more symmetric configurations, which tend to have a lower energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Molecular dynamics mutation: A short MD simulation in the NVT ensemble (constant number of particles, volume and temperature) is performed including cluster and support atoms at high enough temperatures ensur- ing that the cluster atoms are mobile, which can even be above the melting temperature of the cluster, and then the system is cooled down slowly to avoid completely amorphous configurations. This move is inspired by simulated annealing69 and minima hopping70 optimiza- tion procedures, and it is well-known that MD is good at finding transition paths over low energy barriers70. The cluster is thus allowed to naturally jump over po- tential energy barriers as provided by the available ki- netic energy. This takes advantage of the shape of the PES, instead of being completely random such as the rattle mutation. This move is more expensive to run, since it requires a couple of thousand of MD steps, and it would be extremely expensive to implement in an ab- initio based search, but it is straightforward to perform with the NNP approach. Even then, this move requires more computing time than the other simple mutation plus local relaxation moves. For this reason, this move is given a lower occurrence probability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interatomic distances, within the cluster as well as between cluster and support, are checked after every type of move to avoid too repulsive atomic overlaps, and if this check fails the mutation is repeated a number of times until successful, or dis- carded if too many failures accumulate. This is most relevant for ab-initio based GA searches, where long relaxations due to closely overlapping atoms would cost a lot of computation time. But, this is still important in our case, since unphysical atomic positions can give rise to configurations that are out- side the training set of the NNP, leading to less reliable energy and force predictions due to extrapolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We find it necessary to remark that although the moves might bias the final cluster shape in certain directions, they only provide an avenue of change, since in the end the energy of the cluster as evaluated through a particular force field dic- tates whether the structures are accepted or not. This means that it is hard to over-bias the cluster, but on the other hand it is possible to not offer enough mutations, resulting in the cluster exploring only a part of the configuration space.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key component to a successful GA run is maintaining structural diversity in the breeding population. Otherwise, this population can become overrun by a small number of very fit candidates, which leads to always breeding the same chil-\n",
      "\n",
      "dren configurations and the GA search stalling. This struc- tural diversity can be achieved in a number of ways, such as penalizing candidates that have already been chosen for breed- ing67. In general, a way of quantifying structural similarity is needed. In this case we use an interatomic distance compara- tor61, which is insensitive to rotations and translations of the compared atoms. A first filter is applied comparing the ener- gies of the structures in question. Afterwards, the comparator value is calculated employing the interatomic distances.

Instead, methods with flexible grids could be tested74. BHMC66 is in our experi- ence too slow, since structures are still connected through a Monte Carlo-like chain. Instead, GA offers the advantage of evaluating many structures in parallel. Of course, a number of BHMC simulations could be run in a trivial parallelization approach, but GA benefits from biasing future candidates with information from previous candidates, thanks to the crossover operations.\n",

As we consider a good prediction of the bulk prop- erties of copper and zinc oxide as important, we have chosen the uncorrected PBE functional providing the most accurate description.

Since carrying out these electronic structure calculations is the most time- consuming step of the NNP construction, this data set should be kept as small as possible. This avoids wasting computa- tional time on calculating ab-initio data on configurations that a given type of simulation will not visit, or the reverse, missing training data for configurations that emerge in a simulation. For example, Monte Carlo simulations are more likely to visit high energy configurations corresponding to less-favorable relative atomic positions when compared to molecular dynam- ics simulations, that generate trajectories guided by the inter- atomic forces.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is thus important to tailor the structure generation method to the simulations being performed, and if possible to inte- grate both processes46. Several aspects need to be consid- ered. Structures need to be generated covering a wide range of the PES, but not at random since this samples irrelevant high- energy regions. Structures also need to fit within the available computational resources, i.e., they should contain only up to about 200-300 atoms per structure in case of DFT, while also avoiding to compute identical or very similar environments repeatedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The protocol we have followed for the generation of the NNP in the present work can be summarized and categorized into the following phases, also presented in fig.1:\n",
      "\n",
      "In phase I, structures are generated from known configu- rations, i.e., known crystal structures and surface models, for which either experimental data or theoretical information is available. In our case, this corresponds to Cu and ZnO bulk structures in their fcc and wurtzite crystal structures, respec- tively; low Miller index surfaces of both materials, and Wulff- shape nanoparticles. Additionally, the NNP includes some ad- ditional data for brass structures47. These base structures are then modified in a well-defined way. For example, the ex- perimental lattice parameters and interatomic distances of the bulk structures are varied in a small range, to accommodate for possible DFT deviations from the experimental values, and to provide the NNP with more information around the equi- librium conditions. Additionally, thermal distortions are em- ulated by randomly displacing the atoms around their equilib- rium positions, which is also important to break the symme- try of the atomic configurations. For slab structures, different numbers of layers are included. This results in a NNP that is applicable to a narrow range of conditions centered around the base structures, and is useful for finding simple structural and energetical parameters18, such as lattice constants, bulk moduli, and surface energies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In phase II, NVT and NPT ensemble simulations are uti- lized. With these simulations the system is naturally allowed to explore the available configurations at given temperatures and pressures. Included in this is melting and subsequently cooling the systems to introduce realistic liquid and amor- phous environments into the data set, which would be diffi- cult to achieve with the procedural methods of phase I. Struc- tures are sampled at regular intervals, e.g. every couple of picoseconds, or by utilizing an ensemble of NNPs44,46 to scan specifically for new configurations. After phase II, the NNP is usually able to perform long NVT and NPT MD simulations without visiting unsampled regions of the PES. In the present case we require both high energy configurations, generated e.g. by GA mutations and crossings, which are not well sam- pled in a canonical ensemble, and close to equilibrium low en- ergy structures. Other simulation methods that allow the NNP to explore reasonable sections of configuration space are also useful, such as Monte Carlo atom swaps47 that exchange el- ements, simulated annealing69, and semi-grand canonical en- semble simulations89.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phase III aims to include high-energy structures and con- sists of two parts. First, random copper clusters are generated on different ZnO surfaces. Structures are checked for short in- teratomic distances and rejected if atoms are too close together to avoid unphysically large, spurious repulsive forces, which can lead to problems both in the DFT calculations and in the fitting procedure. We set this threshold at 20% below the nearest neighbor distance for the respective material, which is sufficient to cover the usual deviations from this distance ob- served in clusters and provides the required information about the relevant repulsive parts of the PES. This enables the NNP to perform the second part, where iterative GA searches are carried out. In this iterative approach, GA searches are run based on a given NNP for different cluster sizes, which is very fast. Both minimized and unrelaxed structures resulting from\n",
      "\n",
      "a mutation or crossover operation are then extracted and eval- uated, again utilizing an ensemble of NNPs44,46. With this procedure we obtained about 200-500 new structures per GA run. These structures then have been recalculated by DFT, a set of new NNPs has been generated for the extended data set, and this process has been repeated iteratively several times until convergence has been reached, which is defined here by two NNPs trained on the same data set agreeing on the predic- tions for the obtained clusters within the accepted energy and force tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two problems need to be solved in this hierarchical ap- proach. The first is to avoid recalculating structures that are already well represented in the data set. The use of ensem- bles of NNPs can assist the selection, since structures that are already included will exhibit small errors in all NNPs trained on this data set, while unknown structures will have very dif- ferent errors for different NNPs. A complementary method based on the quick classification of SF sets and atomic en- vironment descriptions has been employed here as well, and also other algorithms like CUR are in principle available to se- lect the most distinct training structures90. Of course, repeated environments cannot be avoided completely, since for exam- ple the presence of a slab support will often lead to redundant atomic environments, in particular in the bottom-most layers of the support, which hardly change while the cluster and the top layers are optimized.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second problem to solve is extracting smaller struc- tures from the very large systems used in the simulations, once atomic environments that need to be added to the DFT data set have been identified. This is a problem particular to the sub- set of structures derived from supported clusters, since other structures that we have used in training the NNP (bulk solids, slabs, etc.) are already intrinsically periodic and designed to fit within the available ab-initio calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid periodic images affecting the GA search, which can lead to self-interacting periodic configurations such as wires and sheets of copper atoms on the surface, the GA sim- ulations are performed on large slab supports with up to a thousand atoms. These structures are too large for routine DFT calculations, and even if they would be feasible, they would offer very little new information with respect to the re- quired computational cost since most support atoms are too far away from the cluster to notably interact. To reduce the system size for the DFT calculations, we need to extract the relevant atoms from the simulations47,91 while preserving the local atomic environment of these atoms. In the particular case of supported clusters we also need to maintain the peri- odicity of the extracted subsystems, which is required by the VASP code, which is not able to perform non-periodic cal- culations, and, more importantly, for obtaining realistic struc- tural models without artificially merging ZnO surfaces at the edges of the periodic boundary condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this, the key realization is that rectangular cuts that preserve the periodicity of the underlying surface lattice will also tile periodically correctly. This assumption holds, of course, if the atoms in the slab have not been substantially distorted from their equilibrium positions. To account for pos- sible small distortions due to cluster-support interactions, our\n",

This sometimes requires centering the cutting surfaces on different atoms of the system until a cut fulfilling requirements i) and ii) has been found. Additionally, slightly adapting the size of the cutting box from the the size dictated by the ZnO lattice con- stants by 1-3% might be required. Taking into account these considerations, it is possible to obtain periodic subsystems with minimal mismatch at the cell boundaries that are suit- able for routine DFT calculations. This procedure is shown in fig. 2.\n",

The resulting errors are shown in Table I. Based on these errors we have selected the architecture with 2 hidden layers and 15 nodes in each layer for the subsequent simulations. This architecture yields a 2.5 meV/atom root mean square er- ror for the training energies and 59.7 meV/Bohr for the train- ing forces, with very similar values for the testing data not included in the fitting process indicating the absence of sig- nificant overfitting.

This optimizer was chosen mainly for being the fastest for our par- ticular setup and rather robust.

      "Just pairing with no mutation seems to be the most con- sistent operation, with energy changes clustering around the 0% mark. Angular mutation moves generate the highest en- ergy configurations, which is usually a consequence of fewer atoms being attached to the surface. Molecular dynamic runs are very effective at generating lower energy configurations, with their data set the only one with a median energy change below zero. They still can generate very high energy config- urations due to the occasional formation of separated isolated atoms. Rattle, mirror and twist mutations exhibit a similar be- havior between them, with the twist mutation obtaining the largest energy gain.\n",

      "## A. Structure of the ZnO Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The structure of the support is very important for the ob- tained optimized clusters. For this reason, we have carefully checked the description of the bulk material as well as of the relaxed geometry of the ZnO surface provided by the NNP. The optimized lattice parameters of the bulk ZnO wurtzite structure we obtained are presented in Table II. They are ba- sically indistinguishable from the reference DFT results, and are only 2% above the experimental values97, which can be ascribed to the employed exchange correlation functional.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the ZnO(1010) surface that we use in this work, Figure 4 shows all the relevant angles and distances as obtained from a geometry relaxation of a 4 layer, (4 × 7) ZnO(1010) slab. We observe the known geometry changes due to relaxation from the introduction of vacuum interfaces, with layer dis- tances shortening in particular close to the surface, and tilting of the ZnO dimers to an angle of 9.85 degrees. These values are very similar to the ones obtained from DFT calculations, and to previous results reported in the literature98.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the next step, we have employed GA simulations to iden- tify the GM and energetically favorable LM structures of a se- ries of cluster sizes at the ZnO(1010) surface. Figure 5 shows the results of running the GA algorithm for Cu clusters be- tween 4 and 10 atoms. Four separate runs have been carried out per system yielding 3000 structures each, and then the re- sults of the runs for each cluster size have been combined and analyzed. Before doing this, as shown in Fig. 3 it was con- firmed that different repeated runs tend to find the same GM although; since the process is stochastic, this is not necessarily always the case67. Still, most of the minima have been found multiple times, within a single run and also across runs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We find a rich variety of structural patterns. First, we note that it is possible to detect a number of \"geometric fami- lies\" that are consistently present in the best ranked clusters. One important general trend is that Cu atoms tend to interact strongly with the oxygen atoms of the surface, preferring a direct adsorption, or the adsorption between the Zn and O of a ZnO dimer. Further, they can also be located between two surface oxygen atoms, like the Cu atom at the bottom of the image of LM 2 for Cu5 in Fig. 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Cu4, we identify the simplest structural patterns, and here we can derive our second important principle: Even for small sizes the clusters already adopt a 3D shape, and do not lie flat on the surface. The same is observed for all other cluster sizes, with only a few rather flat configurations being found among the lowest energy clusters although they do ap- pear at higher energies. Additionally, if somewhat trivial, the Cu atoms do indeed form clusters and do not spread across the support into individual adsorption sites. This clustering is well known from experimental results even at low coverages21, and can be predicted from the relative binding and surface energies of the materials involved99. Some separated clusters are ob- served in simulations of the larger clusters as a consequence of certain mutation moves, but these always correspond to high energy configurations. Finally, we notice that neither here nor for any other size do the clusters form extended periodic struc- tures in one or two dimensions, as has been proposed in other studies20. These kinds of structures were only ever observed in our simulations for very small periodic cells, which prevent the formation of non-interacting clusters due to rather high copper coverages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the small number of atoms in the Cu4 cluster, it ap- pears to form only two main structural patterns at low ener- gies. The first pattern is a truncated square pyramid with only 3 atoms present on the support, which is found in the GM in Fig. 5 and in LM 5. Notice that the GM and LM 5 are in fact very different with respect to the support, as the ad- sorption footprint on the ZnO(1010) surface is not symmetric because of the orientation of the ZnO dimers corresponding to the polar (0001) and (0001) surfaces. In this direction, we have a short Zn-O distance within the dimers, and a long dis- tance between different dimers. For both structures, the GM and LM 5, the three copper atoms attached to the surface are in the vicinity of oxygen atoms. However, in the GM two of them are in between two surface ZnO dimers and only one is\n",

Perfectly stacked structures like LM 2 and 3 cannot easily be realized for bigger clusters, but are sometimes ob- served for specific cluster sizes at higher energies. Notice that also these structures exhibit the preferential directional- ity mentioned in the previous paragraph, and are elongated to some extent in the ZnO dimer direction. Due to their structural similarity, we cannot fully exclude that these structures are connected by only small energy barriers or even correspond to the same shallow minimum, which might also be dependent on the employed exchange correlation functional or subtleties of the NNP, and further investigations using e.g. DFT-based nudged elastic band calculations100 might be used to finally clarify this question.

      "For Cu5, many of the structures are natural extensions of the Cu4 structures. In particular, the GM is the completed square pyramid with the missing atom added in one corner, while LM 1 is a distortion of this structure.

In LM 3 the distortion of LM 1 ex- tends to both sides of the pyramid base making it very likely that this distortion represents true local minima in LM 1 and LM 3. The local minima LM 4 and LM 5 resemble distorted structures emerging from the GM of Cu4 by the attachment of an additional copper atom.\n",

For LM 3 we observe a first cluster with distorted five-fold symmetry, and a number of rather flat clusters occur that follow the corrugation of the surface in the cases of LM 2 and LM 5. More interestingly, LM 2 is the first cluster to extend beyond the (1 x 1) surface cell, which will become the norm for larger clusters. This new extension is larger in the \"short\" direction of the surface, perpendicular to the direction of the Zn-O dimers. This is reasonable, since this distance is shorter and thus easier to \"bridge over\" as the cluster grows.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Cu7, many of the clusters appear to be directly related to those at Cu6. The new GM is a direct evolution of the previous saddle-like GM of Cu6, with another related structure at LM 5. LM 1 and 4 are related to the five-fold symmetry cluster at the LM 3 of Cu6, and LM 3 is similar to the previously flat triangular cluster. Of these clusters, only 2 remain within the (1 × 1) cell, which are interestingly the lowest and the highest energy structure, with the rest increasing in footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Cug, the GM is a moderately distorted version of the cluster at the LM 1 of Cu7, with an extra atom added in the lower left corner of the image, but it can also be thought of being derived from LM 4 thus unifying two rather stable sub- patterns. For LM 1 and 5 we notice new modifications of the saddle, a new five-fold derived cluster emerges in LM 3, and a first cluster with a buckled hexagonal base pattern plus an attached atom at LM 4.\n",

      "\n",
      "These analyses of the structural and energetic trends leads us to a general conclusion: the shapes of these clusters are a compromise between the interaction between copper and the support, which would tend to favor spread out, flat clusters, and the cohesive energy of the copper clusters, which tends to favor three-dimensional clusters. Additionally, the granular nature, corrugation and symmetry of the support, with pre- ferred adsorption sites, and the strain that it induces on the clusters, complicates this interaction. This is a known effect\n",

All other energies can be obtained from NNP calculations. Notice that since the only term that changes between clusters is Ecluster+slab, this plot also shows the relative energies between all the clusters. As expected, we observe a stronger binding (the binding energy becomes more negative) with increasing number of copper atoms. Ad- ditionally, the spread in energies within a cluster size becomes smaller as the clusters become larger.\n",

      "\n",
      "An interesting question is what local structure the clusters adopt at the contact with the interface. We can expect that for very large clusters, far away from the influence of the support, the central atoms will organize in the geometry of fcc bulk copper. However, right at the interface, a number of oppos- ing trends influence the structure. First, it is known that finite solids such as nanoparticles tend to adopt shapes dominated by the need to minimize the surface energy, as described by Wulff102. This, in principle, applies to large structures where surface and bulk energetic terms dominate, that are in equilib- rium, with only one element, and more importantly, consid- ering solid-vacuum interfaces, although attempts have been made to extend Wulff's theory to interfacing materials99 and alloys 103. Since here we are addressing very small clusters, which in addition are strongly influenced by the ZnO inter- face, we have to take into consideration its effect. The degree of interaction between the cluster atoms and the support can lead to new preferred geometries. This can be due to low-\n",

If we take one low index surface from each material, it is not possible to produce a co- incident supercell without straining, i.e., expanding, contract- ing, or even reconstructing, at least one of the two subsystems. Such lattice mismatches can induce defects and strain in struc- tures, which are known to enhance catalytic properties 108-110 , and it is still present to some extent for finite structures such as clusters. It is partially reduced by losing the requirement for a periodic structure, which allows for lateral changes of the interatomic distances, but the atoms in the interface area are still guided by the underlying geometry of the support to adopt regular positions.\n",

      "We note that the clusters studied in this work are very small and thus regular surface facets corresponding to the low-Miller index surfaces in a Wulff-like picture cannot be expected, but still small structural features geometrically re- sembling these surfaces may emerge, which we will now in- vestigate. The interfacial atoms of the minimized clusters of Fig. 5 are shown in Fig. 7. For this purpose we define in- terfacial atoms as those within a 1.6 A vertical distance of the lowermost Cu atom of the respective cluster. This inter- val was chosen as it is thick enough to potentially contain a monolayer of all the low index Cu surfaces. The ideal (100) and (111) monolayers are flat, but the (110) monolayer has a thickness of about 1.275 Å, i.e., one-half of the nearest neigh- bor distance, d0. The distance criterion has been chosen about 0.3 Å larger than this value to accommodate also distorted positions of Cu atoms on top of the support, with vertical dis- tances falling in the range of 1.3 to 1.6 A. Additionally, those atoms further away from the substrate are displayed in a per-\n",

Identifying surface features at the interface in such a heterogeneous system is not trivial, but we attempt an analysis by a comparison with the well- known low Miller index surfaces of copper, (111), (100) and (110), which are known to be the most stable ones111 for the material in vacuum, in the given order112.\n",

      "For Cu4 and Cu5 we observe a variety of patterns, including some triangular configurations. The GM of Cu5 is reminis- cent of the (100) surface, organized in approximately square units of Cu atoms. This surface, which is the second most stable out of the three low index cuts in vacuum, only ap- pears for the smallest clusters. In LM 3 of Cu5 we observe the first example of a structural pattern that repeats for many of the larger clusters: five interfacial atoms, structured as a rectangle with an atom in the center that is slightly above the plane formed by the other atoms. Both, the buckled (110) and the planar (111) surfaces of fcc crystals are somewhat related. The (111) surface is usually described as a planar layer of hexagonally arranged atoms, but can also be reinterpreted as a rectangle plus a central atom-in-plane pattern. Its hexagons are completely symmetrical with equivalent bonds. The rect- angle has two characteristic distances: a short one equal to d0, the nearest neighbor distance of 2.55 Å, and a long one equal to v3a0, the lattice constant of bulk copper, yielding 4.42 Å. The (110) surface is usually interpreted as the rectan- gle plus central atom pattern, with the central atom belonging to a higher or deeper layer resulting in a buckled and rather open surface, but it can actually also be reinterpreted as asym- metrical tilted hexagons, i.e., they are longer in one dimension than the other one. The distances in the rectangle consist of: a short one, which is again equal to do, 2.55 Å, and a long one equal to do, 3.64 A. This means that actually the (111) and (110) surfaces are in fact quite similar, with the key difference being whether the hexagonal pattern is flat or buckled and the\n",

      "Figure 7. Interfacial Cu atoms of the optimized clusters in Fig. 5, with the number indicating the interface area per cluster atom as calculated with the convex hull algorithm. We have defined as interface atoms all those atoms belonging to the cluster that are within 1.6 Å vertical distance of the lowermost atom of the cluster, enough to encompass up to one monolayer of Cu (110) plus a margin of error. The radius for Cu atoms has been scaled by distance to the surface (larger as the distance increases) for visualization purposes.\n",

      "related consequences for the interatomic distances. We can smoothly convert from one surface to the other by flattening the (110) configuration, which causes the other Cu atoms to move away and increases the length of the long side of the rectangle.\n",
      "\n",
      "As can be seen in Fig. 7, at the interface we obtain a mixture of both behaviors, with clusters showing a structural interme- diate of both surfaces. Some interfaces are flatter with larger distances in the long direction (closer to (111)), while in oth- ers we observe the opposite configuration (closer to (110)). In fact, this can vary within one cluster size or even one struc- ture, such as the GM at Cu10, which exhibits two parts with the two different extremes. In effect we observe structures that are in a continuum between the two extremes of Cu (110) and (111), which is a consequence of the cluster shape at the inter- face adapting to the ZnO surface geometry, while still subtle distortions resulting from the Cu-Cu interactions are present. Due to the small size of the clusters they are rather flexible in shape and none of the atoms has the full copper environ- ment of the bare metal surfaces in vacuum. This structural behavior is expected to change with an increasing number of copper atoms, finally resulting in copper interface structures more similar to one of the ideal copper surfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "## D. Properties\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next step, we have analyzed a number of geometric properties of the obtained clusters to identify possible struc- tural trends. Specifically, we have looked at:\n",
      "\n",
      "· The fractional coordination number113 of the atoms in the cluster. The fractional coordination number con- verts the usual integer-valued coordination number into a continuous value. For an atom within a certain dis- tance of the central atom, like r0 = 2.55 Å, the nearest neighbor distance in bulk copper, the coordination num- ber contribution is 1. For atoms beyond, smaller values which rapidly decrease with increasing distance from the coordinated atom are used. In effect atoms beyond the nearest neighbor distance are considered as partially coordinating. Here, this avoids rapidly changing co- ordination numbers due to cluster atoms being slightly beyond the nearest neighbor distance, which frequently occurs for small metal clusters.\n",
      "\n",
      "· The height of the cluster, as given by the difference in z coordinates of the top and bottom-most atoms in the cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "· The maximum distance of any atom to the center of mass (COM) of the cluster. This shows the maximum extent of the cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "· The average nearest neighbor distances, for each atom and for the whole cluster, with neighbors in the cluster up to 3.0 Å away.\n",
      "\n",
      ". The volume of the cluster as obtained from the QHull convex hull algorithm library114. The convex hull algo-\n",
      "\n",
      "15\n",
      "\n",
      "rithm returns the smallest convex polyhedron that con- tains a collection of points, i.e., the position of the clus- ter atoms. From this one can derive the properties of a polyhedron such as volume and surface area, but also other properties, for instance if an arbitrary point is in- side or outside the constructed polyhedron.\n",
      "\n",
      ". The area of the atoms at the interface, also using QHull. Interface atoms are chosen following the definition in Sec. IV C, i.e., within 1.6 Å vertical distance of the low- est cluster atom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these properties may have catalytic consequences, such as the coordination number of the cluster atoms, while others characterize the overall geometry of the clusters. We have plotted the results in Fig. 8, showing the values for the GM, and the average value for the GM plus the first 5 LM, with the bars indicating the minimum and maximum values of the property within this group.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Fig. 8 a) we plot the fractional coordination number, and we can observe that this quantity is not yet saturated for clus- ters of size 10, since we are still in a rather small size regime that does not allow to approach the fcc bulk value of 12. The cluster height in b) does not show any clear trend for the dif- ferent GMs, and there is quite a spread within each class, but the average shows a steadily increasing value in spite of the diversity of the cluster geometries. As expected, the average nearest neighbor distance in c) slowly approaches the equilib- rium value (2.55 Å in fcc Cu) from below, i.e., most cluster atoms are closer than in a bulk environment. This is related to the pattern imposed by the ZnO support as explained in the previous section but also a general property of small metal clusters, as the remaining bonds in undercoordinated atoms tend to be stronger and shorter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 8 d) shows that the clusters slowly increase in radius, and is the only property where the GMs show a common be- havior in that all of them are at the average or below indicating a more compact shape. The plot of interface area with the sup- port in e) shows a rather slow growth past 6-7 atoms, which implies that the extra atoms coming into the clusters are not used to substantially increase the footprint of the cluster on the support. This might be related to the fact that the clus- ter needs enough atoms to bridge the sometimes significant gaps between oxygen adsorption sites on the surface. Finally, f) shows the interface area, i.e., footprint on the support, to volume ratio of the cluster, which supports the analysis of e). Note that most of the GM lie at the lower end of this range, that is, they tend to optimize their surface to volume ratio, but this trend may not necessarily extrapolate to larger clusters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it does not seem possible to easily differen- tiate the GMs by utilizing just the calculated properties, al- though some general trends can be discerned, such as GM usually being more compact (Fig. 8 d), and with a minimized interface surface to volume ratio (see Fig. 8 f). We ascribe this to the overall very small cluster size in this study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we have also colored the clusters by those prop- erties that can be expressed on a per-atom basis, as seen in Figs. 9 for the fractional coordination number and 10 for the\n",

We observe the first fully surrounded/coordinated Cu atom with 8 other near- est neighbor Cu atoms at the center of the GM of Cu9, (see Fig. 9 Cu9 a). This is the first size that can present a full coor- dination sphere, and this happens to be the putative GM at this size. The only other fully coordinated cluster appears as a LM for Cu10. Although it would be expected for fully coordinated structures to be energetically favored, this does not seem to be the case at these small cluster sizes.\n",

      "ing the multiple minimizations required. In other simula- tions the surface is kept frozen in first, coarse minimizations to save on resources and then the best clusters from these pre-optimizations are further optimized with more expensive methods and flexible surfaces. This could lead to biased re- sults if the initial filtering employs a frozen support. But what happens, if we do not allow the surface to relax to the presence of the cluster?\n",
      "\n",
      "To analyze this, we first investigate the effect of the cluster on the surface. As an example, Fig. 11 shows the distortions in the ZnO slab for the GM of Cu10. In this case, some of the atoms below the cluster have been slightly displaced from their layer, being pulled towards the cluster. Fig. 11 a) shows in a top view the lateral distortion on the surface of the slab. We can see that very small lateral distortions reach all the way to the periodic boundary even for our very large surface cell, which shows another reason why utilizing large enough opti- mization cells is important. Smaller cells might inhibit or alter these distortions, and thus change the energetic ranking of the clusters. Further we can see that these distortions do not just follow the symmetry of the cluster but can exhibit pronounced directionalities close to the cluster due to the asymmetric ori- entation of the ZnO surface dimers. b) plots this effect in a cross section for the interior of the slab. In this case, we can\n",

      "impact on the relative stability of the studied clusters and on the identified LM, as overall the energy difference are quite subtle and not very large. Even though some of the correct GM and LM structures might reappear in a subsequent sec- ond optimization in which the frozen substrate constraint is lifted, at least if there are no sizeable barriers, usually only the best intermediate structures are further refined, and thus the best overall structures may be missed in such a second step.\n",

      "## V. CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "We have performed a genetic algorithm global optimization search on the most stable structures of copper clusters with 4 to 10 atoms on the (1010) surface of zinc oxide employing a high-dimensional neural network potential constructed for this purpose using DFT reference data. This search, which essentially provides results of first-principles quality at a frac- tion of the computational costs, can be performed in very large surface cells demonstrating the need to use a flexible support to obtain meaningful low-energy structures. For the obtained global and local minima we have extracted important struc- tural trends that aid in the understanding of the interaction be- tween both materials. We have shown that a number of struc- tural families are consistently present among the low energy configurations, often exchanging their ranking as the cluster size changes. A detailed analysis of various geometric proper- ties of these clusters has been performed. In general, the GM aim to minimize their size and their interface area to volume ratio. The energy differences within a given cluster size are often very small, and thus clusters are expected to intercon- vert at moderately elevated temperatures. In general, we find that the clusters prefer to interact with the substrate through the surface oxygen atoms, with the footprint of the cluster limited to a rather small surface area evidencing the compe- tition between support-cluster and cluster-cluster interaction. With respect to the interfacial structure of the clusters and the support, we observe that at the interface the clusters arrange themselves in a continuum between Cu (111) and (110) struc- tures, already starting at cluster size 5, and becoming more prevalent at larger cluster sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, these results establish a complex picture of the interaction between the cluster and its support. The clus- ter needs to 1. interact with the support at specific sites, and within this constraint 2. minimize its energy. This kind of strong dependence between cluster morphology and support properties is already well known in the literature. Studies are available both for theoretical coarse models99,101, and more specific atomistic simulations and experimental results 104-106 and is known as strong metal-support interaction. ,\n",

They identified the global minima and low-energy local minima of these clusters, revealing a range of structural patterns and determining how copper atoms prefer to interact with the surface. The clusters tended to form three-dimensional shapes and had a complex relationship with the support, preferring to interact with oxygen atoms of the ZnO surface.

      "\n",
      "1. **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**: The mention of neural networks in association with VQE was not substantiated by the paper provided. While VQE does offer benefits by reducing computational demands through a hybrid quantum-classical approach, the link to neural networks is not directly discussed in the cited paper. The paper focuses on VQE methodologies and best practices, but does not mention neural network integration. **It is recommended to adjust the blog text to accurately reflect the scope of the cited paper.**\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**: The blog text's discussion on QML is consistent with the cited paper \"Exploring Chemical Compound Space with Quantum-Based Machine Learning,\" supporting the claim that QML can accelerate the prediction of molecular properties, improving computational efficiency in the field. This part of the text aligns well with current research findings. **No revisions are required for this section.**\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Neural Network-based Potential Energy Surfaces (NN-PES)**: The blog content concerning NN-PES is supported by the paper on the global optimization of copper clusters using a DFT-based neural network potential. The paper validates the blog text's statements about the computational benefits and the ability to simulate complex molecular dynamics using neural network approaches. **The blog section on NN-PES is factually accurate and requires no changes.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps**: Please update the section discussing VQE to accurately reflect the content of the cited paper. Once the required adjustments have been made, confirm the completion of edits so that we can proceed to the final stages of preparation for publishing the blog post. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the updated draft, consider removing the direct association between neural networks and VQE unless additional sources specifically discussing this connection are cited.

      "Making Complexity Accessible: Demystifying the Technicalities\n",
      "\n",
      "In the rapidly evolving world of technology, neural networks have emerged as one of the most intriguing and complex advancements of our time. Bridging the gap between the highly technical aspects of neural networks and the general understanding of curious, non-specialized readers requires an approach that simplifies without sacrificing accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neural networks are inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute human brains. Imagine a network as a bustling city map, where intersections are \"neurons,\" and roads are \"synapses\" that connect these neurons. The neurons communicate through these synapses using electrical signals, much like cars traveling to convey information. Flowcharts or diagrams can serve as visual aids to represent this concept. These visuals should depict layers of interconnected nodes, resembling a neuron's web, with inputs entering one side and outputs exiting the other, symbolizing the flow of data through the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beauty of a neural network lies in its ability to learn and improve over time. Initially, the connections between these 'neurons' within the network (the city's roads) aren't ideal; they may have potholes or lead to dead ends. However, as the network is trained—fed with more data and given feedback on its performance—these connections improve, just like a city upgrading its infrastructure. This learning process can be represented with a graph, showing performance on the vertical axis and training time on the horizontal axis, illustrating the network's learning curve or improvement over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further demystify the concept for our readers, let's consider interactive visual elements, such as infographics and simulations, that allow the audience to 'play' with parameters, witnessing real-time changes in the network's behavior. For instance, an interactive simulation could allow users to add or remove layers and neurons, or adjust the weights of connections, and see how these changes might affect the ability of the network to learn a pattern or solve a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employing analogies and visual aids not only makes the content more engaging but also enhances comprehension. By tapping into intuitive understandings, such as comparing a neural network's learning process to a city's road system development, we can make abstract concepts relatable and grasping the functionalities of a neural network less intimidating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complexity is not a barrier but rather a challenge for effective communication, and with the right tools, we can make even the most intricate technicalities accessible to all.\n",
